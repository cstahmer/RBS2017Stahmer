The Cruikit liedis the blind THis world it waggis I what not how , And na man may ane uther trow : And every man dois pluke and pow , And that the pure may find , Our Court it is decayit now The cruikit leidis the blind . Althocht the world wise be cruikit , This common well he hes miscuikit , Our Lords are blind and dois overluikit He gydis thames as he list Taken they not tent he will not huikit To guide thames in the missed . He halds our Lords at variance , He garris the taken put esperance They will get daily help of France , This he garris thames confide Says Ingland will bring money Lance Unto the uther side . Our Lords are now dealt in twa sydis , And every faction in him confydis : You will heir tell how he thames gydis , And you leif years few Sen he hes maid sa money slydis Trow you he can be true . Fra he in Court in credit grew , He did ay change the Court anew : The Queen his doings sair did rew , And riched sa did his Mother , The counsel kennis give he was true , To hun that was his Brother . In Edinburgh when they convene , Our Lords to him they gang bedene : As he war outher King or Queen , He hes thames at his bidding His crafty counsel will be seen , When Dogs barkis on the midding . Albeit he have the Fever quartane , He should be made knight of the Gartane He rewlis Edinburgh and Dunbartane , As Maddie dois me tell : Give he war Pape I am riched certain He walled reule hevin and hell . Gif he gar Atholl do sic shame , As to consent to bring his hame : And give the gyding to Madame , They will put down the King The Crown will altar from that Name , Than Murderars may sing . He hes gart Hume begin to tyre , Althocht that he got his desire : Bot he will leid him in the mire Thought he hecht to defend him , And Ingland set his lands in fire I what not quha will mend him . Also he got Setoun out of hands , From forfalting he savit his lands : Thought he be lyand under bans He will not knaw the King : Sen you ken how the mater stands , Should he have leif to fling ? Our riched Regent quha was our targe Laid sundry things unto his charge , The quhilk in dead war very large As is kenned with anew , You have gevin him ane plane discharge And says it was not true . I what you saw never ane styme , And wantit baith ressoun and rhyme , When you forgaif him all his crime : And maid his oddis evin , Thought he be fristit at this time He will not be forgevin . I pray you Lords on ather side , That you his sawis do not confyde , For I will sweir you be Sanct Bride He suffeis not thre strais , Quha should be rewlar nor our guide May he bruke that he hais . All their maters he dois bot mock , He hes devysit money sic block : He can beguile ane Landwart Jock , Except he ken him well : They say he can baith quhissill and cloik , And his mouth full of meill . My Lords quhat is this that you mean I think the holkis overgangis your ene , I walled sum man walled scheir you clean That you might see their faults , And be not blind as you have b [ e ] ne Nor led with thames that haultis .
