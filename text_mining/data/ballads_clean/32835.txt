The Shepher'ds Lamentation FOR HIS PHILLIS . Tune of , As I lay musing all alone . AS I lay musing all alone , close down by a Crystal Fountain , I herd a Shepherd make great moan for his Love that long had been , As he lay musing all alone , Fetching many a bitter groan , And on his Hat there seem'd to be A branch of a green-willow-tree . How now Shepherd , what means that Thou wear'st thy Willow on thy Hat ? Formerly 'twas blue and yellow , Now is turn'd to a bunch of green-willow It is my Phillis and only she , That makes me wear the Willow-tree . When I lay me down to rest , Love lies bleeding in my breast , Cease , said I , and do not mourn For her that holds thy heart in scorn ; But hereafter be like they That Courts a new face e'ery day . FINIS . Printed for J. Blare at the Looking-Glass on London-Bridge . The Shepher'ds Lamentation FOR HIS PHILLIS . Tune of , As I lay musing all alone .
