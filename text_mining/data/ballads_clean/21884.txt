THE Dutch's Happy Conquest : OR , THE French Routed In their Voyage to [ ? ] Tyrconnel in Ireland , Feb. 28 , 1689. Tune of the Thundering Canons Roar . Licensed and Entered according to Order . O hark ! I hear the French and Dutch ; Lately met and had a ronch , TO [ h ] e which does [ vex ] the Pop [ i ] sts much , to hear the French are routed ; For the Dutch did [ make ? ] them [ soar ? ] As they did meet them going over , [ I ] n [ tO ] ending fo [ r ] the [ Irish ? ] shore , as on the Seas they [ counterfeit ] [ ? ] tO [ ? ? ] . The French we [ r ] e going as its said , Over to Ireland for to Aid TO [ yr ] con [ l ] , but they w [ e ] re betrayed , and by the Dutch were boarded ; For when the Dutch did with them meet , [ Galla ] ntly they did them treat Wit [ h ] pow [ worser ] [ ? ] strong and bullets g [ r ] eat ; their thundering Cannons roared . And now Tyrconnel he's undone , Not knowing which way for to run , His Enemies the Dutch to shun , who reigns in Chief at Sea sir , For now he thinks to Fr [ a ] nce to get , But he'll be catched in a Net ; For he's on e'ry side beset , and moneys he hath none sir . Then let the French King take his part , By Sea or Land he'll find the smart ; For the Dutch will never start since that we are United , And Protestants do all agree ; In time tO [ h ] e [ P ] open [ e ] of [ R ] ome to see , And make his Holiness to flee , and run as he were frighted . For why the Dutch lie on the Sea , To watch Monnsieur continually , Who is their greatest enemy , where ever they do go sir ; And now the French may stay at home . For now the Dutch will keep their own , In the dispi [ tO ] e of Bab [ i ] lon what ever they can do sir . For all that ever the French can do , Will not make brave Holland bow : That they will make the French to know that they will keep the Seas clear ; For if they dare but once peep out , Then to be sure they'll have the Rout By the Dutch , who are so stout , and valueth not Mounsieur . And Englands Valour will be tried , With brave Holland for to side , To pull down Mounsieurs haughty pride , for all his false Delusions ; For let him know , his Countrymen That persecuted were from them ; In time do hope to come again , and to his own Confusion . Now to the Whore of Babylon , Here's a Cup of Confusion , Which great King William hath begun , so wisely and so wary ; Let heav [ e ] ns bless Him e'ry day , The Royal Sceptre for to sway , And Protestants may ever pray , for WILLIAM and Queen MAR [ Y ] Printed for R. Hayhurst in Little-Britain . THE Dutch's Happy Conquest : OR , THE French Routed In their Voyage to [ ? ] Tyrconnel in Ireland , Feb. 28 , 1689. Tune of the Thundering Canons Roar .
