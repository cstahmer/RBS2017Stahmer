Beside the bloody French must come , Oh! where are we then e'ry one ? For Father , Mother , Son and Wench , Must all be Slaves unto the French . Our Liberty , Religion , and All that's dear unto this Land , Must by a Papist Power be Enslaved then in Misery . But [ tO ] Heaven , who does Power give , Does still preserve our King alive , Inspite of Plotters wicked hand , Who would destroy our King and Land. As by this wicked bloody Plot Of Papists , who together god , Some Irish , French and English , who Would hands in Royal Blood embrue . At Richmond they designed to act This villainous and bloody Fact ; But by a Letter that was sent , It did ( thank God ) the same prevent . Another time they had pit [ c ] ' d , When the King was a Hunting gone , Two or three hundred had agreed To make our Royal King to bleed . But now comes all their discontent , For several are to Newgate sent , And must remain in Goal each one Till tried , then Tybourn is their doom . London : Printed for M. Carew , in Old-Bedlam .
