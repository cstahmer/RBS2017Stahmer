Humbly Recommended to the CALVES HEAD Clubb . Subscriptions are taken in by his Wife . HERE Lies Stoic John , Born since Forty and One , Reviver of the Good old Cause , Who when alive , Made Schism to thrive In Spite of all our Laws . He Banter'd the Court , The Church was his Sport , And Spoil'd the design of the Tack ; The Navy him fear'd , Wherever they steer'd , That Roger would Towel their Back . Charles Leslie and Rook He often put to't , And sadly besmear'd the Gown ; The Ministry Blur'd , Jack car'd not a TO --- worser For Her that Inherits the Crown . All Power was given , To the People from Heav'n , John prov'd by Right and good Reason ; Before he was Bang'd , He ought t've been Hang'd Long since , for Damnable Treason .
