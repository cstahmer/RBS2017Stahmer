The bloody Miller Being a true and just Account of one Francis Cooper of Hocstow near Shrewsbury , who was a Millers Servant , and kept company with one Anne Nicols for the space of two years , who then proved to be with Child by him , and being urged by her Father to marry her he most wickedly and barbarously murdered her , as you shall hear by the sequel Tune , Alack for my Love I die . L Et all pretending Lovers take warning now by me , Lest they ( as I ) procure their woe , and work their misery : For I my self have overthrown , as you shall plainly see , I for my transgression must die . I was a likely Country Youth , and might have lived well , But yet in since and wickedness more [ s ] tO Youngmen did excel ; But mind what for my cruel deeds to me at last befell : I for my etc I was a Miller by my Trade , it plainly does appear , Pretending love unto a Maid , whose Father lived near , But she for my acquaintance , poor soul , did pay full dear : I for my etc She was a fair and comely maid , thought modest , grave , and wise , And 'twas supposed all wickedness did utterly despise But my dissembling flattering tongue did her poor Heart surprise : I for my etc Though I was young and likely too , I wanton was and wild , And by my amorous carriage she most strangely was beguiled , She did believe my flattering tongue till I god her with Child : I to my etc At last she to her Father told that she and done amiss , Who seemed much astonished , and woned [ r ] ed much at this ; But I false wretch , and Judas like , betrayed her with a kiss : I for my etc Her Father sent her to the Mill to ask him her to marry ; Which he then seemed to refuse , and told her she must tarry but by my strange & amp ; treacherous tricks I strangely did miscarry : I for my etc There was another Maid beside whom I kept company , Which made me far more impudent in my immodesty ; But my first Love I did forsake and utterly deny : I for my etc She told me I must marry her , or for the Child provide ; Five pound I offered , which by her was utterly denied ; She in the full conclusion by me was mortified : I for my etc One Sunday on and Evening tide for her poor soul I sent Who came to me immediately not dreaming what I meant , And so into a secret place we sinful sinners went : I for my etc There kissing and embracing her , my treachery appeared , I like a cruel bloody wretch , whom she so little feared , Did murder her in such a sort , the like was never herd : I for my etc From Ear to Ear I slit her mouth , and stabbed her in the Head , Till she poor soul did breathless lie before her Butcher bled , For which most cruel horrid fact I now am punished : And for my etc My bloody fact I still denied , disowned it till the last , But when I saw for this my fact just judgement on me past , The blood in Court ran from my nose yea ; ran exceeding fast ; And for my etc So like a wretch my days I end , upon the Gallow-Tree , And I do hope my punishment will such a warning be , That none may ever after this commit such villainy ; And for my transgression I die .
