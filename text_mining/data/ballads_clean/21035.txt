A Weeks Loving , Wooing , and Wedding : OR , Happy is that Wooing that is not long a Doing . Here was a nimble Bridegroom , and a Bride , In Eight short days the long fast Knot was tied . To the Tune of Billy and Molly . Licensed according to Order . O N Sunday Johnny went to Church so spruce , and neat , and finey , Cupid lay for John at lurch , and showed him pretty Jinny , Johnny was shot to the heart , and proved a zealous Lover , That Jenny she might cure his smart , he was resolved to move her . Johnny was a stiching Blade , but he could not work a Monday ; Jinny loved the stitching Trade , And minded John a Sunday : He to her did make Address , but she received it shiely , The loving truth he did confess , but Jinny she was wily . Tuesday came , and Johnny then professed to her profoundly , He loved her more than any Man , and spoke his Passion roundly ; Jinny she did love to spin , as pretty Maids do often , She fancied John could put it in , and that did Jinny soften . On Wednesday then the Lovers met , and Johnny pressed her home to't ; He said his Love was on her set , but she said nought but mum to't : Jinny was a coming Lass , her Silence was consenting , When John had brought it to that pass , he then fell to presenting . On Thursday then he brought her store , what Maid could have forsook ' em ? Of Ribbons , Gloves , with sundry more , and she said No , and took'em : Johnny was a Lover free , though bound in Jinny is Fetters , Jinny loved as well as he , though she might a had his Betters . On Friday Johnny asked her what she had to say against it ; She said there was two words to that , for fear she should repent it : But John she did her so persuade , that she gave no denial , But said she should be her own Blade , and put it to the Trial. On Saturday there never was seen such Billing , and such Cooing ; Jinny and her John between , such Kissing and such Wooing . Thus both agreed in Love to speed , concluded on the Morrow , That they would Wed , and so to Bed , and sport away all Sorrow . On Sunday they to Church did go , where Love first had beginning , The Parson he made one of the two , so the Business had and ending : John and Jinny married were , O! merry night of Sunday ! Pretty Maids do not Despair , it'll be your own case one day . Printed for P. Brookshy at the Golden Ball in Pie-corner , J. Deacon at the Angel in Gilt-spur-street , J.
