The Complaint of a Sinner . To the tune of the bonny broom . CHrist is my love he loved me , when I was wretch forlorn True God from all eternity , true man of Virgin born : He pierced the Heavens , he came to earth , for me his blood to spill : Yet through my sins I have him lost , woe worth my froward will : The bonny Broom , the well favoured Broom the broom blooms fair on hill : Him have I lost that loved me best , my love against his will . My crooked ways , my words profane , My thoughts to evil inclined , Hath made this Love to lightly me , and show himself unkind . Thus do I spend my days in care , my nights in mourning still : For losing him that loved me best , [ ? ] [ ? ] wite my froward will . [ The bonny Bro ] ome , etc [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ] Sweet Christ my love , I must confess , the cause of all my pain . Hath been my own disloyal heart , that would not true remain : But sought for pleasure here below , that soul and body kill : And brake my promise made to thee , alas my froward will . The bonny broom , etc Long have I dwelled in Kedars tents , and long in Meshech bidden : And from thy presence full of icy , my feet have long time slidden , Yet on my barren heart Oh Lord , some drops of grace distil : That I may find thy love again , and change my froward will . The bonny broom , etc O , let me sorrow for my sin , and hate my ruthful raze , O let my silly soul enjoy , the favour of thy face : Till thou forget thine unkindness , and I my mourning still , And with a free reformed heart , renounce my froward will .
