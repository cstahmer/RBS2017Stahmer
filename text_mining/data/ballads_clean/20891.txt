To New-gate Goal we did repair , rude Ruffians to Convert , And showing of our Christian care , went with the Tyburn Cart ; But little thought to see this day , a woeful Destiny , For we must pass the self same way , then heigh boys up go we . Now dearest Friends of Holy Church , we never shall see you more ; Why did you leave us in the lurch , [ to pay ] the [ good ] old score ?
