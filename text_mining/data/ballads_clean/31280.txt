Quoth she , Alas , what shall I do , or unto whom shall I make my moan ? Each day and hour increase my woe , and yet I dare not make it known ; With sighs , etc O , that I had ne'r been born , and being born had dy'd just then ; Each Virgin will hold me in scorn , I shall be scoff'd by all young Men ; With sighs , etc At six months end she could perceive , her belly swell , and big did grow , The Babe within her womb did strive , and Friends began the cause to know ; With sighs , etc Poor Isabel distressed with grief , laments her folly , but too late ; Instead of giving her relief , her Friends do prosecute their hate ; With sighs , etc But she not able to endure their anger , and her own disgrace , Resolves to find a speedy cure , in some convenient private place ; With sighs , etc With this sad resolution bent , she takes a dagger in her hand , 'Twill make a heart of stone relent , the truth of this to understand ; With sighs , etc She prays that Heaven would her forgive , then to her heart her dagger sent , And down she dropped ; let those that live , take care betimes , and all repent ; At last she cry'd , etc Lord Wigmore hearing of this , he never more had quiet rest , His guilty heart did in him bleed , and privately his sins confessed , Fair Isabel , forgive , and I Will pine with sorrow till I die . I must confess I did thee wrong , and openly will it proclaim ; Let all young Men that hear this Song , take c [ a ] re they ne'r command [ i ] tO the same : Fair Isabel , etc And when I am dead , and blood is cold , to show , my Dear , I lov'd thee well , One Tomb shall both our Bodies hold , such is my love for Isabel : Fair Saint forgive my crime , and I Will pine with sorrow till I die .
