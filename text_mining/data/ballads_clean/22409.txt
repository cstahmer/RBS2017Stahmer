To the Tune of , Oh Billy , etc Licensed according to Order . YOu that would not our glorious Peace believe , but wished we might to Ruin run ; Chosen which you please either rejoice or grieve , it's all a Case to us the Work is done ; You may repine while we with Wine and Music fine this Day adore : Let Trumpets found , and Healths go freely round , at Peace proclaimed in London Streets once more . Behold , brave Boys , the Wars are at and end , Joy sits enthroned on e'ry Brow ; The Tidings through the Kingdom let us send , for it's a Day , a Day of Triumph now , Both far and near , let Joy appear , for now it's clear the Wars are over : Let Music play to celbrate the Day of Peace proclaimed , etc While loyal-hearted brave heroic Souls , make known their universal Joy ; Through Court and Kingdom with full flowing Bowls , it will the Thoughts of all our Griefs destroy ; With cheerfulness , since we possess , this happiness , let Cannons roar , And Music play to celebrate the Day , of Peace proclaimed , etc We come to take our leaves of bloody Wars , with Reaths of Laurel fresh and green , A happy perjod to those Princely jars , there's nothing now but Triumph to be seen ; A splendid show wherever we go ; si [ n ] ce it is so , let Cannons roar , And Music play , to celbrate the Day , Of Peace proclaimed in London streets once more . Great Jove the God of War shall sheath the Sword , which has such dreadful havoc made ; Since Heaven does a joyful Peace afford , and now more cheerful Streamers are displayed ; Found Trumets , found , while Healths go round , with Joy we're crowned , the Storm is over ; Let Music play to celebrate the Day of Peace proclaimed in London Streets once more . Behold they flock from all adjacent Parts , as Joy is on the the speedy Wing , And with a Comfort of true Loyal Hearts ; they Cry , God save our Right Renowned King ; Long may he Reign , who ploughed the Main , and now again does Joy restore , Let Music play , to celbrate the Day Of Peace proclaim worser , etc The dreadful Sword has raged this many Years , and did the Christian World annoy ; Now since at length a glorious Peace appears , who can forbear to Ring the Peels of Joy ; Sure there are none but what will own , that Peace alone will joy restore ; Let Music Play to celebrate the Day , Of Peace proclaimed , etc This may the unbelieving World convince , that Joy and Triumph was at hand , Who would not scarce believe our gracious Prince , although he strove to bless our native Land ; He crossed the Seas , yet scarce could please such Men as these , but not it's over : Let Music play to celebrate the Day , Of Peace proclaimed in London Streets once more .
