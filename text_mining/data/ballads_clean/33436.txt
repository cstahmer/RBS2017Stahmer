'Tis Money makes a Man : OR , The Good-Fellows Folly . Here in this Song Good Fellow thou mayest find , How Money makes a Man , if thou'rt not blind ? Therefore return e're that it be too late , And don't on Strumpets spend thy whole estate , For when all is gone , no better thou wilt be : But Laughed to scorn in all thy poverty . To a pleasant new Tune : Bonny black Bess : Or , Digby . By J. Wade . OO what a madness 'tis to borrow or lend , Or for strong Liquour thy Money to spend ; For when that is wanting thy courage is cool , Thou must stand Cap in hand to every fool : but if thy pockets can jing [ l ] e they will take thy word O then thou art company for Knight or yet Lord : Then make much of a Penny as near as you can , For if that be wanting thou'rt counted no man . Then listen a while and i'le tell you in brief , The most of my sorrow , my care , and my grief ; I had and estate I'll make it appear , Beside all my stock , was worth fifty a year : But so soon as I to drinking then fell , My Land I then Mortgaged , my Cattle did fell ; No sooner the money I for them had took , But it went to the Alehouse i'le swear on a book . Thus in a short time my money did waste , And I found myself not a pin better at last ; While other Tradesmen were working full hard , I from and Alehouse could not be debar'd : There would I fit tippling day after day , And my Wife she unto me full often would say , Make much of a Penny as near as you can , For if that be wanting thou'lt be counted no man . But the words that she spoke i'd regard not a straw But would kick her , & beatrice her , & keep her in awe ; My children at home might eat the bore wall , While I in and Alehouse for strong liquour did call : And my Hostis forsooth must needs fit on my knee though my wife she hath twice more beauty then she Yet that would not please my lecherous mind , Because for my Money my Hostis was kind . But in the conclusion here comes all my care , My back it grew thin , and my pockets grew bore ; Then I told my Hostis my pitiful tale , In hope's that my sorrows she would bewail : But she turn'd up her nose , and she looked a squoy , You might have been wiser she straight did reply ; This was all the comfort that I god from she , That always pretended my friend for to be . THerefore all youngmen that loves the Alebench Some counsel i'le give them before they go hence ; If thou sit'st day and night , & drink'st never so fast Yet thou'lt find thy own home is the best at las It is but for your money they wait you upon , And when that is wanting you'r lightly look't on ; If she sees but twopence you run on the score , She'l swear by her troth she will trust you no more Then have a care youngmen , be ruled in time , Lest drink overcome thee , in old days you pine : For you see Good-fellows how threadbare they go And what good-husbandry brings a man to ; For some lives most bravely though means they have small , And some that has hundreds doe quickly spend all ; Then make much of a penny as near as you can , For if that be wanting thou'rt counted no man . 'Tis money you see makes a Lord , or yet Earl , 'Tis money you see that sets out a young Girl ; Likewise 'tis money makes the Lawyer to prate , & 'tis money does make the man love his wife Kate And 'tis money breeds love where never was none , Although she be old , yet money makes her young : A Knight or a Beggar , whatever they be If they have but money they'r welcome to me . Thus money you see , and do well understand , If a poor man can but get it , he buys house and land But it must not be those that works hard all day , And at night in and Alehouse does throw it away . Nay , that will not serve , but twice as much more , If his word it will pass , he runs on the score ; Then all the week after , though then he don't heed He wants breadcorn his poor children to feed , Therefore be advised boon Companions all , For you see the world's so they laugh at a men fallen With speed your old haunts pray begin for to shun , Take warning by others the which are undone : You'l say a goodfellow it is a brave name , But many a man does pay dear for the same : The which hath all spent , now in Goal he does lie , And none will relieve him in his poverty . But some men have god such a spark in their throat That I would not be him that should quench't for a groat ; All the fair words his wife can him give , Yet he'l not be ruled though poor he does live : Hang money he cries , till all on't is gone , As for house [ a ] and Land I mean to buy none ; I must see my Hostis to go neat and fine , Although that my family does starve and pine . And thus have I told you the conditions of some , That all long of strong liquour will never keep home His stock it d [ e ] cays , although his wife cries , And in the conclusion a beggar he die : but a good husband's means you see does increase He maintains his household in joy and in peace ; Then make much of a penny as near as you can , For if that be wanting , thou'lt be counted no man FINIS .
