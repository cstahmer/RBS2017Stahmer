Constant , fair , and fine Betty . Being The Youngman's praise , of a curious Creature . Fair she was , and fair indeed , And constant always did proceed . To the Tune of , Peggy went over Sea , with a Soldier . NOw of my sweet Bettie , I must speak in praise , I never did see such a Lass in my days , She is kind and loving , and constant to me ; Wherefore I will speak , of my pretty Betty . Betty is comely , and Betty is kind , Beside she is pretty , and pleases my mind : She is a brave bonny Lass , lovely and free , The best that ere was , is my pretty Betty . Her hair it does glister , like to threads of gold ; All those that do meet her , admire to behold : Her they take for Juno , so glorious seems she , More brighter then Lun is pretty Betty . Her eyes they do twinkle , like stars in the sky , She is without wrinkle , her forehead is high : Fair Venus for beauty , the like cannot be , Thus I show my duty , to pretty Betty . She hath fine cherry cheeks , and sweet Coral lips , There is many one seeks , love with kisses and clips , But she like Diana , flies their company , She is my Tytana , my pretty Bettie . Her Chin it is dimpled , her visage is fair , She is finely templed , she is neat and rare . If Hellen were living , she could not please me , I joy in praise giving , my pretty Betty . Her skin white as snow , her breast soft as down , All her parts below , they are all firm and found : Shee's chaste in affection as Penelope . Thus ends the complexion , of pretty Bettie . The second part , To the same tune . NOw of her conditions , something I'll declare , For some have suspicions , She's false being fair : But shee's not false hearted , in any degree , I'm glad I consorted , with pretty Betty . Her words and her actions , they are all as one , And all her affection , is on me alone , She hates such as vary , from true constancy , Long I must not tarry , from pretty Betty . Well met my sweet Honey , my joy and delight , Oh how hath my Cony done ere since last night . O what says my dearest , what sayest thou to me , Of all maids the rarest , is pretty Bet . Wo. Kind love thou art welcome , to me day and night , Why came you not home , I did long for your sighs My joy and my pleasure , is only in thee , Thou art all the treasure , of pretty Bet . Hadst thou not come quickly , I think I should die , For I was grown sickly , and did not know why . Now thou art my doctor , and physic to me , In love thou art proctor , for pretty Bet . Sweet when shall we marry , and lodge in one bed , Long I cannot carry , not my maiden head . And there's none shall have the same , but only thee , This thee that I crave , to love pretty Bet . Man. Besse be thou contented , wee'l quickly be wed , Our friends are consented , to all hath been said , Thou shalt be my wife , ere much older I be , And I'll led my life , with my pretty Bet . These lovers were married , and immediately , And all was well carried , they liv'd lovingly : Let fair maids prove constant , like pretty Besse , Fine Besse hath the praise an't , and worthy is she .
