ON THE SENTENCE Passed by the HOUSE of LORDS ON Dr. SACHEVERELL . HAIL Pious Days ! Thou most propitious Time , When Hated Moderation was a Crime : When Sniv'ling Saints were cropped for Look of Grace , And Branded for a Conventicle Face . Whole Floods of Gore distain'd the Guilty Years , Noses Ragou'd , and Fricasies of Ears : When Rampant Laud the Churche's Thunder threw , His Sacred Fury no Distinction knew : The People suffer'd and the Priesthood too . But now behold the bright Inverted Scene , Mercy returns in a Forgiving Queen : Her Senate's Anger burns in milder Fires ; Proud of that Clemency which She inspires . Calmly they Try their Enemy professed , And tho' they Damn the Doctrine , Save the Priest . On the deluded Tool Look mildly down , And spare the Factious Pedant for the Gown ; So when in sullen State by Peasants bound , The Gen'rous Lion walks his thoughtful Round . Shou'd some small Cur his Privacy invade , And cross the Circle which his Paws had made : Fir'd with Disdain , he hurls his Eyes below , But loath to Grapple with so mean a Foe ; Bestrides him , Shiv'ring with Inglorious Fear , And Pisses on the Wretch he scorns to Tear .
