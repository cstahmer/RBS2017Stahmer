In B [ e ] thlehem , upon this morn , The great Messiah Christ was born ; The night before that happy tide , The spo [ tO ] l [ e ] ss Virgin and her gum [ i ] worser [ e ] , Were long time seek [ i ] ng up and down , To find some lodging in the town : But mark how all tO [ h ] ings came to p [ a ] ss , The inns and lodgi [ n ] gs fi [ l ] led was That they could have no room at all . But in a fill [ th ] y ox's stall . This night the Virgin Marry mild Was s [ a ] fe deliv [ e ] r'd of a child , According un [ tO ] oh heav'n's decree , Man's God and Sav [ i ] oh [ u ] r for to be . Ne [ a ] r B [ e ] thl [ e ] h [ e ] m some shepherd's kept And watch'd their flocks while others slept , To whom God's a [ n ] gel did appear , Whi [ c ] h put the shepherd's i [ n ] great fear . Pre [ p ] a [ r ] e and go , the angel said , To Bethlehem , be not afraid , There shall you see this bl [ e ] ssed morn , The bless [ worser ] b [ a ] b [ e ] sweet J [ e ] sum [ s ] born . With thankful h [ e ] arts and joyful mind , The shepherd's went this b [ a ] be to find , And as the heav [ e ] nly angel told , They did our Sav [ i ] our Chr [ i ] st behold . Within a manger was he laid , The Virgin Marry by him stayed , Attending on the Lord of life , Bei [ n ] g both mother , maid , and wife . Three eastern wi [ s ] e men from of [ a ] r , Direct [ worser ] b [ y ] tO [ h ] e glorious star , Came boldly oh [ n ] , and made no stay , Until they came where Jesus lay . And being come unto the place Where the blessed Messiah was , They humbly laid before his feet The [ i ] r gifts of gold and odour sweet . S [ e ] e how the Lord of heaven and earth Shew'd hims [ e ] lf lowly in his birth : A sweet ex [ a ] mple for mankind , To learn to bear and humble mind , No costly robes nor ric [ h ] atti [ r ] e , Did Jesus Christ our Lord desire ; No music or sweet harmony , Till glorious angels from on high Did in melodious ma [ n ] n [ e ] r si [ n ] g Praises unto our heavenly King . All honour , glory , might and power , Be unto Christ our Saviour . If choirs of angels did rejoice , Well may mankind with heart and voice , S [ i ] ng praise [ e ] s to the God of heaven , That unto u [ s ] his Son has given , Moreover , le [ tO ] us ev'ry one , Call unto mind , and think upon His righteous life , and how he dy'd To h [ a ] we poor sinners justify'd . Suppose , Oh man ! that thou shouldst lie I [ n ] prison stron [ g ] , condemn'd to die , And that no man upon the earth , Could ransom thee from cruel death , Ex [ c ] ept you can some party find , That for your sake would be so kind Freely to part with his own blood , To save thy life , to do thee good . Such was the love of Christ , when we Must else have lain perp [ e ] tually In hell , our souls from th [ e ] nce to save , Himse [ l ] f a sacrifice he gave . Whi [ l ] st in this world he did remain , He never pass'd a day in vain ; In fasting , preaching , prayer divine . He daily in the temple taught , And many m [ i ] racles he wrough He gave the blind their perfect sighed , And ma [ worser ] e the lame to walk upri [ g ] ht ; He cured the lepers of th [ e ] ir evils , And by his power cast out devi [ l ] s ; He called Laz [ a ] rus from the grave ; And to the sick their health he gave : And yet , for all such good works wrought , The Jews his full destruction sought ; The traitor Judas was the man , That with a kiss betray'd him then ; Then he was led to justice-hall , Like one despis'd among them all ; And had the sentence gi'n that [ a ] tO he Must suffer death upon a tree . Unto the execute [ i ] on place , They brought him with disgrace ; With vile reproaching taunts and scorns , They put him on a crown of thorns ; Then to the cross , tO [ h ] ro' hands and feet , They n [ a ] il'd h [ i ] m f [ a ] st , but o ! how great Must be that [ e ] pain and anguish he There suffer'd on the cursed tr [ e ] e : But that's not all [ l ] , to augment the smart , With bloody sp [ e ] are th [ e ] y pierc'd his heart . Thus would [ v ] e you s [ e ] en and herd aright , The love of Christ the Lord of might ; And how he shed his precious blood , Only to do us sinners good . WIthin this rock that rock is l [ a ] id , Who both the tomb and maker made ; A man that ne'er was such beside ; Tho' just , no [ n ] e so unjustly dy'd . Nothing he ow'd , and yet did pay The whole world's worser [ e ] bt all in one day . He living gave relief to all , That did in fa [ i ] th up [ oh ] n h [ i ] m call ; And on the cross he p [ r ] ay'd for those That to the d [ e ] ath did him oppose ; And while by the hand of death he fell , He conquer'd Death , the Devil and Hell : Therefore unto his holy name , Be Honour , Glory , Power , Fame .
