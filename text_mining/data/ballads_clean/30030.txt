Come buy this new Ballad , before you do go : If you rail at the Author , I know what I know . To the Tune of , I'll tell you but so . IT is and old saying , that few words are best , And he that says little , shall live most at res And I by experience do find it right so , Therefore isle spare speech , but I know what I know . Yet shall you perceive well , though little I say , That many enormities I will display : You may gusse my meaning , by that which I show , I will not tell all , but I know etc There be some great climbers , compos'd of ambition , To whom better-borne men do bend , with submission : Proud Lucifer climbing , was cast very low , I'll not stay these men , but I know etc There be many Foxes that go on two legs , They steal greater matters then Cocks , Hens , and Eggs , To catch many Gulls in Sheeps clothing they go , They might be destroy'd , but I know etc There be many men that Devotion pretend , And make us believe , that true Faith they'le defend : Three times in one day to Church they will go , They cozen the world , but I know etc There be many rich men , both Yeomen and Gentry , That for their own private gain hurt a whole Country , By closing free Commons , yet they'le make as though It for common good , but I know etc There be diverse Papists , that to save their Fine , Come to Church once a month , to hear Service Divine , The Pope gives them power , as they say , to do so , They save money by't too , but I know etc There be many Upstarts that spring from the Cart , Who got to th' Court , play the Gentleman's par Their father's were plain men , they scorn to be so , They think themselves brave , but I know etc There be many Officers , men of great place , To whom if one sue for their favour and grace , He must bribe their servants , while they make as though They know no such thing , but I know etc The Second Part. To the same Tune . THere be many Women that seem very pure , A kiss from a stranger they'le hardly endure , They are like Lucretia , modest in show , I will accuse none , but I know etc Likewise there be many dissembling men , That seem to hate Drinking and Whoring , yet when They meet with a Wench , to the Tavern they'le go , They are civil all day , but I know etc There be many Bachelors , that to beguile Believing kind Lasses , use many a wile , They all swear that they love , when they mean nothing so , And boast of these tricks , but I know etc There's many and Usurer , that like a Drone Does idly live upon his moneys Lone , From Tens unto Hundreds his money does grow : He says he does good , but I know etc There be many Gallants that go in gay Raiment , For which the Taylor did never receive payment . They ruffle it out with a gorgeous show , Some take them for Knights , but I know etc There be many Rorers that swagger and roar , As though they in th' wars had be seven years and more , And yet they never look in the face of a Foe : They seem gallant Sparks , but I know etc , There's many , both Women and Men that appear With beautiful Outsides , the World's eyes to blear : But all is not Gold that does glister in show , They are five with a Pox , but I know etc There's many rich Tradesmen who live by Deceit , And in Weight and Measure the poor they do cheat , They'le not swear and Oath , but indeed , I , and No , They truly protest , but I know etc There be many people so given to strife , That they'le go to Law for a twopenny Knife : The Lawyers never ask them why they do so , He gets by their hate , but I know etc I know there be many will carp at this Ballet , Because it is like sour Sauce to their Pall But he , she , or they , let me tell ere I go , If they speak against this Song , I know what I know .
