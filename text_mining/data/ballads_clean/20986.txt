THE Ungrateful Rebel ; OR , Gracious Clemency Rewarded with Villainy . Tune of , The Turn-Coat of the Times . H Ere is a disloyal Touch , Now newly come from the Dutch , Of one that has acted much ; And of the Factious breed , He was in the West indeed , Now better to Hang than feed ; His Pardon he did obtain , And now he is gone again , To join with the Dutch , And have tother touch , Is this not a Rogue in grain ? He did a Letter send , Unto and old Factious Friend , And these was the Lines he penned : Allegiance now give over , And come to the West once more , Here's Silver and Gold Gillore , Never stand in the least to pause , Or startle at breach of Laws , But venture your Neck , It is but a check , Stand up for the good old Cause . To my Credit be it spoke , I kept a Shop , but I broke , And vanished away in Smoke ; My Creditors great and small , Faith I have paid them all , But gave them no Coin at all , And now I am gone to fight , And whethered be wrong or right , I cried down the Pope , But it's with that hope , To get a good Booty byed . Though we a Rebellion make , And Heavenly Laws do break , It is for Religions sake ; And therefore we proceed , To make the whole Nation bleed , And count it a righteous deed : When ever I do draw nigh , Great Persons of Loyalty , Is I am a Knave , Their Treasure I crave , For Riffling who but I . We rally and march about , To find the Rich Roman out , Then put them all to the rout , Nay , any Protestant Lord , If with us he won't accord , We'll presently fallen aboard ; For being both stout and strong , We will not stand parling long : If Loyal he be , It's all one to we , We'll Plunder him right or wrong . To take off the Nations Yoke , Religion is made a Cloak , To cover the fatal stroke , But for my part alone , Religion I never had none , Except to disturb the Throne : With Orange now brisk and trim I venture both Life and Limb And if the great Turk , Would set me at work , I would do as much for him .
