A delicate new Ditty composed upon the Posy of a Ring being , I fancy none but thee alone : sent as a Newyeeres Gift by a Lover to his Sweetheart . To the tune of Dulcina . TO How who art so sweet a creature , that above all earthly joy I thee deem for thy rare feature , kill me not by seeming coy , nor be thou mute , when this my suit into thy ears by love is blown , but say by me , as I by thee : I fancy none but thee alone . Hadst thou Cupids mother's beauty , and Dianaes chaste desires , Think on that which is thy duty , to fulfil what love requires , it's love I ask , and this thy task to be propitious to my moan , for still I say , and will for aye , I fancy none but thee alone . Let not selfe-conceit oversway thee , woman was at first ordained , To serve man , though I obey thee , being by loves law constrained , my sobs and tears , true witness bears , of my hearts grief and heavy moan , let not thy frown then me cast down , who fancies none but thee alone . Think what promise thou didst give me , when I first did thee behold , There thou vowedst thou wouldst not leave me , for a mass of Indian gold . but now I find thou art unkind , all former vows are past and gone , yet once again , him entertain , who fancies none but thee alone . Let my true affections move thee , to commiserate my pain , If thou knewest how deer I love thee , sure thou wouldst love him again : I thee affect : and more respect thy welfare then I do mine own : let this move thee to pity me , who fancies none but thee alone . Why should women be obdurate , and men's proffers thus despise ? Dear , be ruled , we'll have a Curate , nuptial rites to solemnize : thou Marigold , whose leaves unfold , when Tytanes rays reflect thereon , on thee I'll shine , for thou art mine , I fancy none but thee alone . The second part . Or , the Maidens kind Reply . To the same Tune . WORSER Ear , I have received thy token , and with it thy faithful love , Prithee let no more be spoken , I to thee will constant prove , do not despair , nor live in care , for her who vows to be thine own , though I seem strange , I will not change , I fancy none but thee alone . Think not that I will forgo thee , though I'm absent from thy sighed , If I knew how to come to thee : Ide be with thee day and night , But well thou knowest , how I am crossed , else would my love to thee be shown , with free accord , yet take my word , I fancy none but thee alone . This proverb hath oft been used , She that's bound , must needs obey , And thou seest how I'm inclused , from thy presence night and day , I dare not show what love I owe to thee , for fear it should be known , yet still my mind , shall be inclined , To fancy none but thee alone . Though my body for a season , be absent from thee perforce , Yet I pray thee judge with reason , that I love thee never the worse . O that I might enjoy thy sighed , then should my love to thee be shown , then do not think , her love to shrink , who fancies none but thee alone . Many times I think upon thee , in my melancholy fits , When I find my self kept from thee , it deprives me of my wits : oft times I weep , when other sleep , producing many a grievous groan , then think on me , as I on thee , and fancy none but me alone . No fastidious motions more [ v ] e me , to be from thy sighed so long Do not then ( my deer ) rep [ r ] ove me , nor suspect I do thee wrong : For be thou sure , I do endure in constancy surpassed by none : I long to see the [ time ] that we , shall of two bodies be made one .
