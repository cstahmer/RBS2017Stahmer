The Merchant's Daughter of Bristow . The Tune is , the Maidens joy . BEhold the Touchstone of true Love , Maudlin the Merchant's daughter of Bristow Town , Whose firm affection nothing could move , [ This ] favour bears the lovely [ bro ] w [ n . ] ] A gallant youth was dwelling by , Which many years had born this maiden great good will She loved him so faithfully , But all her friends withstood it still , The young man now perceiving well , He could not get nor win the favour of her friends , The force of sorrows to expel . To view strange Countries' he intends , And now to take his last farewell , Of his true love his fair and constant Maudlin , With Music sweet that did excel , He played under her window then . Farewell quoth he my own true Love , Farewell my dear and chiefest Treasure of my heart , Through fortune's spite that false did prove , I am inforc'd from thee to part , Into the Land of Italy , There will I wail and weary out my life in woe , Sing my true Love is kept from me I hold my life a mortal foe . Fair Bristow Town therefore adieu , For Padua shall be my habitation now , Although my Love does rest in thee . To whom alone my heart I vow , With trikling tear thus did he sing . With sighs and sobs descending from his heart full soar He said when he his hands did wring , Farewell sweet Love for evermore . Fair Maudlin from a window high , Beholding her true Love with Music where he stood . But not a word she durst reply . Fearing her Parents angry mood . In tears she spent that woeful night , Wishing her self though naked with her faithful Friend She blam's her friends and fortune's spite . That wrought her love such luckless end . And in her heart she made a vow , Clean to forsake her country and her kindred all , And for to follow her true love , To abide all chance that might befall . The night is gone and the day is come . And in the morning very early did she rise , She gets her down into a lower Room , Where sundry Seamen she espies , A gallant Master among them all . The Master of a great and goodly ship was he , Who there was waiting in the Hall , To speak with her father if it might be , She kindly takes him by the hand , Good sir said she and would you speak with any here . Quoth he , fair Maid , therefore I do stand , Then gentle sir I pray draw near . Into a pleasant parlour by , With hand in hand she brings the Seamen all alone Sighing to him most piteously She thus to him did make her moan , She falls upon her tender knee Good sir said she now pity you a woman's woe And prove a faithful friend to me . That I to you my grief may show , Sith you repose your trust he said , In me who am unknown & eke a stranger here , Be you assur'd most proper maid , Most faithful still I will appear , I have a brother then , quoth she , Whom as my life I love and favour tenderly . In Padua alas is he , Full sick God wot and like to die . Full fain I would my brother see , But that my Father will not yield to let me go , Therefore good sir be good to me , And unto me this favour show ; Some ship boys garment bring to mr , That I disguis'd may go unknown , And unto sea I'll go with thee . If this much favour might be shown , Fair maid quoth he take here my hand , I will fulfil each thing that you desire , And set you safe In that same Land. And in that place that you require . She gave to him a tender kiss , And says to him your servant Master will I be , And prove your faithfall friend for this , Sweet master then forget not me , This done as they had both agreed , Soon after that before the break of day , He brings her garments then with speed , [ Therein her ] self she did arr [ a ] y , And ere her Father did arise , She meets her Master as he walked in the hall , She did attend on him likewise , Until her Father did him c [ a ] ll , But ere the Merchant made and end , Of all his weighty matters he had then to say . His wife came weeping in with speed , Saying our Daughter's gone away , The Merchant then amaz'd in mind , Yonder vile wretch away intic'd my child quoth she , But I well wot I shall him find At Padua in Italy With that bespoke their master brave Worshipful merchant thither goes this pretty youth And any thing that you would crave He will perform and write the truth , Sweet youth quoth he if it beso Bear me a letter to the English Merchant there And gold on thee I will bestow My daughters welfare I do fear . Her mother took her by the hand Fair youth quoth she if ere thou dost my daughter see Let me therefore soon understand And there is twenty crowns for thee , Thus through the daughters strange disguise The mother knew not when she spoke unto her child And after her master straight she hies . Taking her leave with countenance mild , Thus to the Sea fair Maudlin is gone , with her gentle master Godsend them a merry wind Where we a while must let them alone Till you the second part do find . WElcome sweet Maudlin from the Seas , Where bitter storms and tempests do arise The pleasant banks of Italy You may behold with mortal eyes . Thanks gentle master then said she , A faithful friend in sorrow thou hast been , If fortune once do smile on me My gentle heart shall soon be seen . Blessed be the land that feeds my love Blessed be the place whereas his person does abide Not real will I stick to prove Whereby my true love may be tri'd , Now will I walk with joyful heart To view the town whereas my darling does remain And seek him out in every part , Until his sighed I do obtain . And I quoth he will not forsake . Sweet Maudlin in her sorrows up and down In wealth or woe thy part I'le take , And bring thee safe to Padua town And after many weary steps In Padua they safe arriv'd at the last For very joy her heart it leaps She thinks not on her sorrows passed Condemn'd to die he was alas Except he would from his Religion turn , But rather than he would to mass In fiery flames he vow'd to burn . Now does sweet Maudlin weep and wail , Her joy is turn'd to weeping sorrow grief & care , For nothing could her plaints prevail , For death alone must be his share , She walks under the prison walls Where her true love did lie & languish in distress , When woefully for food he calls When hunger did his heart oppress . He sighs and sobs and makes great moan , Farewell sweet love for evermore . And all my friends that have me known , In Bristow town with wealth and store , But most of all farewell quoth he My own sweet Maudlin whom I left behind For never more thou shalt me see , Woe to thy Father most unkind , How well were I if thou were here with thy fair hands to close these my wretched foes My torments easy would appear My soul with joy should scale the Skies .
