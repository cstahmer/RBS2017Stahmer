b ( 2 ) THE FIRST PSALM . I . THE Man is blessed that hath not lent To French Pistoles his Ear : Nor rais'd himself as Traitors do , Nor sat in Tricksters Chair . II But in the Laws of Old England Does set his whole Deligh And for those Laws does exercise Himself both Day and Night . III . He shall be like the Tree that grows Fast by the River side : Which bears the fiercest Storm that blows And scorns the roughest Tides . IV. Whose Leaf shall never fade nor fallen , But flourish still and stand : E'er so the Cause shall prosper well , This Patriot takes in Hand . V. So shall not the Pretender's Crew ; They shall be nothing so : But as the Dust which from the Earth The Wind drives to and from . VI . Therefore shall not the Jacobites In Judgement stand uprigh Nor Papishes with Protestants Come into Place and Sighed . VII . For why the Friends of Hanover At Westminster are known : And eke all Schemes at Bar-le-duc Shall quite be overthrown . b ( 2 ) THE FIRST PSALM . I .
