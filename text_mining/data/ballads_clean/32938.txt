To the Tune of , The Wiving Age , etc ATtend my Master's , and listen well , Unto this Ditty , which briefly does tell , Of a fine merry Jest in Norfolk befell , A brave lusty Cooper in that Country did dwell ; And there he cry'd , Work for a Cooper , Maids , ha' you any work for a Cooper ? This Cooper he had a fair Creature to's Wife , Which a Brewer i'th' Town lov'd as dear as his life ; But she had a trick which in some Wives are rife , She still kept a sheath to another Man's knife , And often cornuted the Cooper , While he cry'd , etc It happen'd one morning the Cooper out went , To work for his living it was his intent , He trusted at home to his Wife's government , And left her a bed to her own heart's content ; While he cry'd , Work for a Cooper , Maids , ha'ye , etc And as the Cooper was passing along , Still crying and calling his old wonted song , The Brewer , his Rival , both lusty and young , Did think now or never to do him some wrong , And lie with the Wife of the Cooper , Who better lov'd him , etc He called the Cooper , and to him did say , Go home to my house and make no delay , I have as much work as thou canst do today , Whatsoever thou earnest i'll bountifully pay : These tidings well pleased the Cooper , Oh this was brave news , etc Away went the Cooper to the house of the Brewer , Who seeing him hard at his labour to endure , Thought he , now for this day the Cooper is sure , I'll go to his Wife the greensickness to cure , Take heed of thy forehead good Cooper , For now I must work , etc Then straightways he went to the Cooper's dwelling , The good Wife to give entertainment was willing ; The Brewer and she like two pigeons was billing , And what they did else they bound me from telling ; He pleased the Wife of the Cooper , Who better lov'd , etc But mark how it happened at last , Their sunshine of pleasure was soon overcast , The Cooper did lack one of's tools in haste , He ran home to fetch it , and found the door fast ; Wife open the door ( quoth the Cooper ) And let in thy Husband , etc Now when the good Wife and the Brewer did hear The Cooper at door , affrighted they were , The Brewer was in such a bodily fear , That for to hide him he knew not where , To shun the fierce rage of the Cooper , He thought he should die , etc The good Wife perceiving his woeful estate , She having a subtle and politic pate , She suddenly whelmed a great brewing-fat , And closely covered the Brewer with that ; Then after she let in the Cooper , What's under this tub ? etc She hearing her Husband that question demand , She thought it was time to her tackling to stand ; Take heed how you move it , quoth she , with your hand , For there's a live pig was left by a Friend ; Oh let it alone John Cooper : Thus she thought to cozen , etc Is it a sow-pig ? the Cooper did say , Let me ha't to my supper ; the good Wife said , Nay ; It is a boar-pig , quoth she , by my faith , 'Tis for my own diet , 'twas given me to day ; It is not for you , John Cooper , Then let it alone , etc I would it were in thy body , quoth John , Indeed ( quoth the good Wife ) so it shall be anon ; What e'er become of it , faith thou shalt have none , Why stand'st thou here prating ? I prithee be gone , Make haste to thy work good Cooper , Worse meat's good enough , etc Cannot a good Wife have a bit now and then , But there must be notice taken by the good Man ? I'll ha't to my dinner , Sir , do what you can , It may be I long to have all or none ; Then prithee content take good Cooper , Oh go to thy work , etc The Cooper mistrusted some knavery to be Hid under the brewing-fat ; and therefore he , Was fully resolved for his mind-sake to see ; Alas ! said the Brewer , then woe be to me ; Oh what shall I say to the Cooper ? O would I were gone , etc You Whore , quoth the Cooper , is this your boar-pig , He has been well fed , for he's grown very big , I'll either have of him and arm or a leg , I'll make him unable his tail for to wag , Before he gets hence from John Cooper , I'll make him remember , etc O pardon me , Neighbour , the Brewer did say , And for the offence I have done thee today , I am well contented thy wrath to alley , And make restitution for this my foul play ; Oh prithee forgive me John Cooper , And i'll be a Friend , etc If for this offence thou wilt set me clear , My bounty and love to thee shall appear , I'll freely allow thee and thine all the year , As much as ye'll drink , either strong ale or beer : Oh prithee forgive me John Cooper , And i'll be a Friend , etc O no , ( quoth the Cooper ) i'll have you to think , That I with my labour can buy myself drink ; I'll geld thee or lame thee e'er from me thou shrink : These words made the Brewer with for fear to stink , He feared the rage of the Cooper , Yet still he entreated , etc This Cooper by no means would let go his hold , The Brewer cry'd out to the Cooper , and told Him , there was the key of his silver and gold , And gave him free leave to take what he would ; Oh then be contented the Cooper , These tidings well pleased , etc If thou , quoth the Cooper , wilt swear by and oath , To do all thou tellest me , though I am loath , I will be content to pardon you both .
