TO : The Mad men morris ; or , A warning for youngmen to have a care , How they in Love entangled are : Wherein by experience you shall find , His trouble and grief with discontent of mind . To a pleasant new Tune . H Eared you not lately of a Man , that went beside his Wits , And naked through the Streets he ran , wrapped in his frantic fits ? My honest Neighbours , it is I , hark how the People flout me , See where the mad man comes , they cry , with all the Boys about me . Into a Pond stark naked I ran , and cast away my Clothes Sir , Without the help of any Man , I made shift to get away Sir : How I god out I have forgotten , I do not well remember , Or whither it was cold or hight , in june or in December . Tom Bedlam's but a sage to me , I speak in sober sandess , For more strange visions do I see , [ ? ] end in all his madness ; When first to me this chance befell , about the Market walked I , With Capons feathers in my Cap , and to myself thus talked I . Did you not see my Love of late , like Titan in her glory ? Did you not know she was my mate , and I must write her story ? With Pen of Gold on Silver Leaf I will so much befriend her , For why , I am of that belief , none can so well commend her . Saw you not Angels in her eyes , while that she was a speaking ? Smelled you not smells like Paradise , between two rubies breaking : Is not her hair more pure then gold , of finest Spiders spinning ? Methinks in her I do behold , my joys and woes beginning . I S not a dimple in her Cheek [ : ] each eye a star that's starting ; Is not all graces installd in her , each step all joys imparting : Methinks I see her in a cloud , with graces round about her ; To them I call and cry aloud , I cannot live without her . Then raging towards the sky I rove , thinking to catch her hand , Oh then to Jove I call and cry , to let her by me stand : I look behind and there I saw , my shadow , me beguile , I wish she were as near to me , which makes my Worship smile . There is no creature can compare , with my beloved Nancy ; Thus I built Castles in the Air , this is the fruit of fancy : My thoughts mount high above the sky , of none I stand in awe , Although my body here does lie , upon a Pad of Straw . I was as good a harmless youth , before base Cupid caught me : Or his own Mother with her charms , into this case hath brought me : Stripped and whipped now must I be , in Bedlam bound in chains , Good People now you all may see what love hath for his pains . When I was young as others are , with Gallants did I flourish , Oh then I was the properest Lad that was in all the Parish : The Bracelet which I used to wear about my arms so tender , Are turned into iron plataeae about my body slender . My silken suits do now decay , my cups of gold are vanished , And all my friends do wear away , as I from them were banished : My silver cups are turned to earth , i'm jeered of every Clown : I was a better man by birth , till fortune cast me down . I am out of frame and temper too , though I am somewhat cheerful , Oh this can love and fancy do , if that you be not careful : Oh set a Watch before your eyes , lest they betray your heart : And make you slaves to vanities , to act a mad men part . Declare this to each Mother's Son unto each honest Lad : Let them not do as I have done lest they like me grow mad : If Cupid strike , be sure of this , let reason rule affection , So shalt thou never do amiss , by reasons good direxion . I have no more to say to you , my Keepers now does chide me , Now must I bid you all adieu , God knows what will betide me : To picking straws now must I go , my time in Bedlam spending : Good folks you your beginning know , but do not know your ending .
