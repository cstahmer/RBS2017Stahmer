Young Man.

Fountains clear , etc Maid . Your comparison ( saite she ) I must confess is witty , to stop the stream of true Love it were a pity : But your heart you compare indeed to rocky Mountains for stony oft they are , and cast out several Fountains . Far stony , etc As from some Fountain several streams are running , so many feigned Loves you oft have by your cunning , This hard indeed to pierce your flinty hearts asunder , and stop your fickle streams it is a wonder . And stop , etc Young Man.
