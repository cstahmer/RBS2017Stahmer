Some Luck Some Wit , Being a Sonnet upon the merry life and untimely death of Mistress Marry Carlton , commonly called THE Germane Princess . To a new Tune , called the Germane Princess adieu . Farewell Germane Princess the Fates bid adieu whose fallen is as strange as her story is true , Her peddigree she from a Fiddler does bring and Fiddlers do commonly end in a string , How many mad pranks has she played on the Earth which equally moves us to pity and mirth , But now for a Gamball at Christmas the fool must show us a trick on a three-legged Stool . The first of her tricks was a Freak into France to learn the French language to sing and to dance , And who but a Taylor should lie in the lurch to cut out her work and to led her to Church , He ply'd her to with Gold but when all was prepar'd to measure the Princess about with his yard , She bob'd off the Taylor and made him a Goose but for all her mad pranks she must die in a Noose . Next after to Holland she steered her course and there she abused a Jewelor worse , For when he so many rich jewels had brought seal'd up in a box , she another had wrought , And thus he was chevl'd by the wit of the Girl with pebbles for diamonds and Glasses for pearl , Who after his gelding most sadly bemoans , he quite was undone for the loss of his stones The next that she shew'd was on English-Mans jest and though there was wit in't 'twas none of the best Then who but the Princess , and happy were they , that could but obtain this so welcome a prey : As eagerly she at the Collies did catch , but when she was married she met with her match ; For at last and Attorney did fallen in her way who gave her his Bound and had nothing to pay . A Brickmaker then as a Suitor did go whose news was as strange as the news from Soho For when he came up to his Tenement door he found there was one in possession before , To furnish this Room he sold all that he had and now not to enter it made him stark mad , But she had the money and kept him in awe by bidding him make up his Brick without straw . And now the young gallant that next was trappan'd was a kind of a Drugster as I understand , He thought her so rich that the prodigal fop to gain her sold all that he had in the Shop , But when to this prize he began to draw near he found he had bought his Commodity dear , His forehead did bud and such pains he indur'd as would not by Balsams or Plasters be cur'd A Limner at length who had herd of her fame would needs draw her Picture and give it a frame , With colour and varnish she cheated the Elf and prov'd that she painted as well as himself , He made her a Face and a Robe like a Queen and swore 'twas as like her as ever was seen , But when at the Tavern she left him in paw [ n ] he swore for a Princess a Beggar he'd drawn A thousand such pranks she did daily invent and yet with her money was nevey content , But spent it apace for the proverb you know says wealth that comes lightly as lightly does go . At Masques and at Revels by day and by night with Toryes and gallants she took her delight , She fancy'd alas , it would ne're be day and so never thought of a reckoning to pay . But what was long look'd for is now come at last and the sentence of death on the Princess is past Nor could she be try'd by her peers for no doubt there was not her peer the whole nation throughout But if any more of the gang should be found they are born to be hang'd they shall never be drowned When people must cheat to encourage their pride it is a Dutch trick which we cannot abide .
