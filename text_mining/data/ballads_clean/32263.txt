H : 18299 A new years Gift , entitled , a Crystal glass for all Estates to look in , wherein they may plainly see the just reward , for Unsaciate and Abominable Covetousness . M.D.LXIX . According to my custom , daily I did muse , Upon Gods holy word , which for ever shall endure , I thought it the best exercise that any man could use , Daily to be frequented in the Scripture , The xii of Luke I beheld a place both plain and pure , Giving general warning in saying these words to us , Beware of Covetousness , says Christ Jesus . It first confounded Adam being then in Paradise , Coveting to be as God , and so began to slide , He presumed to have knowledge , and also to be wise , Not contented with his state , nor therein did abide , His coveting ( Alas ) set him clean beside , Regarding Sathans words which coveted his transgre-ssion Covetously he presumed , to be his own confusion , The root of all evil it is , as witnesseth the Scripture , And odious and secret mischief's , as any man can sow , For what Blossom or bud , think you that can prosper , Or what Flower or Fruit , did ever man se grow , But a root it must have first , this full well we know , Beware therefore of it , for this I do confess , The original of all since , must needs be covetousness , Of all since covetousenesse , first polluted Adam , Linked with infidelity , Pride , and disobedience , Which pestiferous since , dwells almost in every man , For lack of grace , constancy , and good intelligence , So we like Adams children , forgetting our obedience , Seeking our destruction , without cause or reward , Like Achab , and Jezabell , coveting Nabothes vineyard . Thus covetousness slew Naboth against all right , The nature of it is such , it never was found good , Woe be to the covetousness thou woeful wight , That without all mercy , so canst thirst for blood , Thou broughtest the general Deluge at Noes Flood , And Gehezie by covetousness , if you harken to this song , Became a foul Lipper , even all his life long , King David by covetousness deceived was , And by concupiscence the story does testify , In coveting the only wife of Urias , Greatly offended Gods divine majesty , But reproved by Nathan , wept and cried bitterly , Search now the scripture , and do what you can , For nothing is found worse , then a covetous man . He that delights in covetousness , hath his soul to fell , Thus says Sirach , to such as they are , Christ by Justice must condemn such to hell , As makes Merchandise of any such ware , The covetous man does always both scrape and spare , Still to satisfy , but his greedy desire , Which at last shall bring him to unquenchable fire . In gathering therefore of Riches , be not to bold , For with assurance they are but as dung , For when many sins are waxed old , Then Covetousness will seem most young , This my Pen utters in steed of my tongue , The children of the covetous being stout and brave , Daily wishes in their hearts , to see there father's grave . Lock not in thy breast this sinful covetousness , Foster it not up , for any flattering fees : Beware and be not nurse to such wickedness , lest thou be found as a Droane among Bees , Not esteemed in common wealth , but as rotten trees , Worthy to be brent where ever that thou dwell , According to Gods providence , fire brands in Hell . Herod the king coveted to slay the only Lord , Resisting thereby his only salvation , As too many there be that hates Gods word , And shall therefore receive damnation , The second of Mathewe makes declaration , How Herode coveted a kingdom not permanent , And therefore slew many a young Innocent . Some coveteth to bye both house and land , But hospitality they will none keep , For Covetousness takes cruel things in hand , Devouring the poor as the Wolf does the sheep , In security of sin , they are rocked fast a sleep , Night and day caring for things that be vain , But wotteth not who shall be lord of all his travel & pain Saint Barnards Chariot they will ride in , Wherein let them continue and dwell : Which nam is Security of vice and since , Leading them post to the Devil of Hell , For such myzers have their souls to fell , Foure wheels it hath to carry on the same , Of all which foure I will show you the name . The first wheel is called Greedy desire , Ingratitude , and contempt of God for other twaine , And forgetfulness of Death , thereto they require , Which foure wheels do continue and remain , To the Chariot of Avarice which is led certain , By three strong horses which runneth forth the raze , Nam , passed shame , past repentance , and past grace . To this Chariot , a careless Carter they must have , Whose name is called Never content , His whip in his hand , like a cruel slave : With two strings called wilful pain , & restless torment These are ordained for everlasting punishment , To belong to this Chariot , for their negligence , To carry away covetous persons from good men's presence This Chariot of Avarice with his horses so fell , Daily is set a work toto in many a place : But whither goes this Chariot I pray you now tell , Some think to Sathan to be resident in place , Carried away by violence from all mercy and grace , To follow the generation of ungodly store , Never to have mercy nor see light any more , Sing covetousness does rob us of mercy and grace , Being the root of all sin and wickedness , Let us remember while we have space , Calling to god to be our righteousness , To aid and succour us , in all distress , And now to covet his everlasting presence , With him to reign for ever when we depart hence , What is the cause of both sacralige and Simony , I will now declare and manifestly express , And show the iniciation of detestable usury , Now being compelled the truth to confess , The origenall of both is very covetousness , Likewise of Bankeroutes and Informers as I here tell , Covetousness lately invented by Sathans counsel , FINIS .
