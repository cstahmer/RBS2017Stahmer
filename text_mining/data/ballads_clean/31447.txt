WHEN William , Duke of Normandy , With all his Normans gallantly , This kingdom did subdue , Full fifteen years of age I was , And what e'er since has come to pass , I can report for true . I can remember since he went , From London for to conquer Kent ; Where walking in a Wood The men of Kent compassed him , And he for ay confirm'd to them King Edward's laws for good . Likewise I William Rufus knew , And saw the arrow that him slew Hard by a forestside . I well could tell you , if I list , Or better tell you , If I wist , Who next to him did ride . First Henry , ay , and Stephen too , Whom no man there but I did view , I saw them crown'd and dead . I can remember well also , The Second Henry's royal show , The day that he was wed . I likewise was at Woodstock bower , And saw that sweet and famous flower Queen Eleanor did so spite . I found that clew of thread again , After that worthy knight was slave , 'Twas blue , read , green , and white . I saw king Richard in his shirt , Pull out a furious lion's heart , Whereby his strength was try'd . I saw king John , when as the monk Gave him the poison which he drunk , And then forsooth he dy'd . I saw the barons when they sent For the French dauphin with intent To put Third Henry by . I saw the earl of Leicester bent , ( Call'd Simon Montford ) with his tent , Besiege fair London-town . And I have the First Edward seen , Whose legs I think to have been A yard or more in length . With him I into Scotland went , And back again incontinent , Which he subdu'd by strength . I knew Carnarvon's minion dear , And saw the fallen of Mortimer , With all the barons wars . I likewise was in armour sent To Burton battle upon Trent , Where I receiv'd these scars . Third Edward and his valiant son , By whom great feats of arms were done , I saw on Crosley-plain . Which day when bows and arrows keen . Grew scant , with mighty stones I ween , Were many Frenchmen slave . I knew What Tyler and Jack Straw , And I the mayor of London saw , In Smithfield with him slew . I was at Pomfret-castle , when The Second Richard there was slave , Whose death e'er since I rue . I saw when Henry Bolinbroke The crown and sceptre on him took , When he became right well . I saw when Henry Hotspur he And many lords at Salisbury , Were slave in battle fell . I saw that brave victorious prince , Whose death I have bewail'd e'er since , Henry the Fifth I mean . And I can give you good report , How many French at Agincourt Were in one battle slave . I saw the white and read rose knight , And Warwick great in armour Bright , In the Sixth Henry [ 's ] reign , And present was that very hour , When Henry was in London tower By Crook-back'd Richard slave . I in the goldsmith's shop have seen Fourth Edward's famous concubine , Whose name was sweet Jane Shore . I saw when Richard's cruelty Did put her to great misery , And I was griev'd therefore . I also was at Bosworth field , Well armed there with spear and shield , Meaning to try my force . Where Richard losing life and crown , Was naked born to Leicester town , Upon a collier's horse . To the Seventh Henry then I was A servant as it came to pass , To serve him at his need . And while I did in court remain , I saw in the Eighth Henry's reign , Full many great men bleed . I was a soldier bold with him , O'er Neptune's curled breast did swim , Unto the realms of France . I help'd to ransack Bulloign-town , And many places of renown , Yet home I came by chance . I knew Sixth Edward of a child , Whose countenance was very mild , A hopeful prince he was . I knew queen Marry in her reign , Put Protestants to much pain , And reset up the Mass. And to my comfort I have seen Elizabeth , that maiden queen , Queen Mary's only sister . Tho' she reign'd four-and-forty years , Her subject's shew'd well by their tears , That they too soon had miss'd her . I saw king James come from the North , Like to a star that shines forth , To glad the people's sighed . He brought a salve to cure our wound , And made Great-Britain safe and found , Thro' equity and right . He was in troth a prince of peace , And made all former jars to cease 'Twixt Englishmen and Scots . The Englishmen sung merry sonnets , The Scots did then throw up their bonnets . For joys of their good lots . In Scotland born , in England nursed , Was pious princely Charles the First , Who had to wife queen Marry . But by the rage of rebels hate , Murder'd and martyr'd at's own gate , This good king did miscarry . King Charles the Second that had spent Many long years in Banishment , And scap'd with life so nearly , By miracles and means unknown , I saw plac'd on the royal throne , Where he did shine most clearly . I saw his royal Brother James , Who was led on by such extremes , Which made the nation weep . I saw his coronation-day , And how he did the sceptre sway , Which long he could not keep . Lord chancellor I saw likewise , When he did rule and tyrannise . By arbitrary power ; And I was in the council-room When Peters he was pleas'd to doom The bishops to the Tower . I present was that very morn , When the Pretender he was born , Which was the tenth of June , In sixteen hundred eighty-eight . But this day prov'd unfortunate , It put all out of tune . I see king William cross the seas , To give the land and nation ease , With a most glorious fleet . I saw him cross to Ireland , With a right valiant armed band , Making his foes retreat . I have his royal consort seen , Marry , our most religious queen , In all her courtly train . I saw her royal funeral , And how the showers of tears did fallen , While subject's did complain . I saw the duke of Gloucester's birth , The glory , triumph , joy and mirth , That was on this great day . I saw his royal mother's tears , When in the blossom of his years Death snatch'd him hence away : I saw king William when he dy'd , Who was the land and nation's guide , A scourge to France and The WANDERING JEW's CHRONICLE .
