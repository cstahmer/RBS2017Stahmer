Come worldling see what pains I here do take , To gather gold while here on earth I rake . What the Father gathereth by the Rake , the Son does scatter with the Fork . COme , come my brave gold , Which I love to behold , come to me and I'll give you rest ; Where as you may sleep , And I safely will keep you lock't in my iron bound chest ; No thieves you shall fear , You in pieces to tear , such care of you still I will take , Come to me and fly Gold Angels I cry , And I'll gather you all with my Rake . Come silver and all , When as I do call , your beauty's to me are so bright I love you so deer , I pray you come near , and be you not wavering or light , Your weight so you have , Come glistering and brave , then you I will never forsake , But heap you together , Against rainy weather , And gather you all with my Rake . Rich Jewels and plate , By no means I hate , with Diamonds , Saphirs , or rings ; The Carbuncle read , Stands me in like stead , or any other rich things , The Emerold green , Like the spring that is seen , gold chains , or the like I will take , I have a kind heart , With my coin I will part , so I may get all with my Rake . But yet here me , friend , No money I'll lend , without a good pawn you do bring , But I'll tell to thee , How a knave cheated me one time with a base copper Ring , With me it bred strife , It near cost me my life , half a crown on the same he did take But I'll have more care , Of such knaves to beware , how such copper together I rake . On leases or lands , On very good bans , good security likewise provide , If we can agree , Then my coin it flies free , if not , your could suit is deny'd , To foe or to friend , No money I'll lend , as they brew , so let them bake , This rule I observe , Let them hang or starve , if I cannot get with my Rake . And those that do lack , To the highth I do rack , I know that they money must have Some mortgage their lands , Which fallen in my hands , to domineer and to go brave , If they fail of their day , And have not to pay , a seizure on all I do make , Although I go bore , Yet I have a care , my gold and my silver to Rake . Let the poor widow's cry , Let their children die , let their Father in prison go rot , What is that to me , Their wealth is my fee , for I have their livings now god , Whole Lordship's and Lands , Are fallen to my hands , and use of them all I will make , My bags full of coin , And my purse I do line , with that which together I rake . Thus rich usury , Ne're thinking to die , nor on his poor soul have a care , With one foot in the grave , Yet more wealth he does crave , and his back and his belly does spare ; At whose cost he dine , With good cheer and wine , he cares not at whose hands he take , Not a penny hee'l spend , Nor without a pawn lend , The Devil and all he will Rake . But now comes grim death , And ceases his breath , his tree of life is wethered , This wretch so unkind , His wealth leaves behind , and is a poor worm being dead : But now pray give ear , To that you shall hear , his heir what a course he will take ; That day he did die , In his grave he did lie , And the Sexton the earth on him Rake . Come Prodigals , your selves that loves to flatter , Behold my fallen , that with the Fork does scatter . To the tune of , To drive the cold winter away . ROome , room for a friend , That his money will spend , old Flatcap is laid in his grave , He kept me full poor , But now I will roar , his lands and his livings I have , The tide of gold flows , And wealth on me grows , hee's dead , and for that 'tis no matter , Great use he did take . And for me did rake , which now with the fork I will scatter . I now must turn gallant , That have such a talon , what need I to take any care , I tell thee good friend , 'Tis mine own which I spend , for I was my Father's own heir : No Blade here shall lack , Give us claret and sack , hang pinching , it is against nature , Let's have all good cheer , Cost it never so deer , for I with my fork will scatter . Let me have a Lass That fair Venus does pass , give me all delights that I may , I'll make my gold fly Aloft in the sky , I think it will never be day : Let the welkin roar , I'll never give o're , Tobacco , and with it strong water , I mean for to drink , Until I do sink , for I with my fork will scatter . And let music play To me night and day , I scorn both my silver and gold , Brave gentlemen all , I'll pay what you call , with me I beseech you be bold : Dice run low or high , My Gold it shall fly , I mean for to keep a brave quarter , Let the Cards go and come , I have a great sum , That I with my fork will scatter . Let Carouses go round , Till some fallen to the ground , and here's to my Mistress her health Then let's take no care , For no cost wee'l spare , hang money , I have store of wealth , My Father it god . And now fallen to my lot , I scorn it as I do mortar ; For coin was made round , To stand on no ground , And I with my fork will it scatter . My Lordship's to fell , I think would do well , ill got goods never do thrive : Let's spend while we may , Each Dog hath his day , I'll want not while I am alive : Come Drawers , more sack , And see what we lack , for money I'll send a porter , Brave gallants ne're fear For wee'l domineer , For I with my fork will scatter . Come , drink to my friend , And let the health end , my Coffers and Pockets are empty , I now have no more , That had wont to have store , ther's scarcity where there was plenty , My friends are all gone , And left me alone , I think I must now drink cold water : There's nought but sad woe , Upon me does grow , Because with my fork I did scatter . Now this is the story , Of prodigal glory , who thought that he never should lack No drink nor no meat , Now he hath to eat , nor clothes for to put on his back : His friends they forsake him , And woe does o're take him , because he was too free of nature , That never did mind , How time comes behind , who mows , though with fork he did scatter . His leaves they grew green , But they were not seen , for Autumn them quickly did kill , Then let youth beware , And have a great care , and trust not too much to their will lest a prison them catch , Or a house without thatch , and glad of brown bred & cold water To God thanks lets give , And in a mean live , having a care how we do scatter .

His leaves they grew green , But they were not seen , for Autumn them quickly did kill , Then let youth beware , And have a great care , and trust not too much to their will lest a prison them catch , Or a house without thatch , and glad of brown bred & cold water To God thanks lets give , And in a mean live , having a care how we do scatter . London printed for Henry Gosson [ dwelling on ] London Bridge . FINIS . N.P. Come worldling see what pains I here do take , To gather gold while here on earth I rake . What the Father gathereth by the Rake , the Son does scatter with the Fork . COme , come my brave gold , Which I love to behold , come to me and I'll give you rest ; Where as you may sleep , And I safely will keep you lock't in my iron bound chest ; No thieves you shall fear , You in pieces to tear , such care of you still I will take , Come to me and fly Gold Angels I cry , And I'll gather you all with my Rake . Come silver and all , When as I do call , your beauty's to me are so bright I love you so deer , I pray you come near , and be you not wavering or light , Your weight so you have , Come glistering and brave , then you I will never forsake , But heap you together , Against rainy weather , And gather you all with my Rake . Rich Jewels and plate , By no means I hate , with Diamonds , Saphirs , or rings ; The Carbuncle read , Stands me in like stead , or any other rich things , The Emerold green , Like the spring that is seen , gold chains , or the like I will take , I have a kind heart , With my coin I will part , so I may get all with my Rake . But yet here me , friend , No money I'll lend , without a good pawn you do bring , But I'll tell to thee , How a knave cheated me one time with a base copper Ring , With me it bred strife , It near cost me my life , half a crown on the same he did take But I'll have more care , Of such knaves to beware , how such copper together I rake . On leases or lands , On very good bans , good security likewise provide , If we can agree , Then my coin it flies free , if not , your could suit is deny'd , To foe or to friend , No money I'll lend , as they brew , so let them bake , This rule I observe , Let them hang or starve , if I cannot get with my Rake . And those that do lack , To the highth I do rack , I know that they money must have Some mortgage their lands , Which fallen in my hands , to domineer and to go brave , If they fail of their day , And have not to pay , a seizure on all I do make , Although I go bore , Yet I have a care , my gold and my silver to Rake . Let the poor widow's cry , Let their children die , let their Father in prison go rot , What is that to me , Their wealth is my fee , for I have their livings now god , Whole Lordship's and Lands , Are fallen to my hands , and use of them all I will make , My bags full of coin , And my purse I do line , with that which together I rake . Thus rich usury , Ne're thinking to die , nor on his poor soul have a care , With one foot in the grave , Yet more wealth he does crave , and his back and his belly does spare ; At whose cost he dine , With good cheer and wine , he cares not at whose hands he take , Not a penny hee'l spend , Nor without a pawn lend , The Devil and all he will Rake . But now comes grim death , And ceases his breath , his tree of life is wethered , This wretch so unkind , His wealth leaves behind , and is a poor worm being dead : But now pray give ear , To that you shall hear , his heir what a course he will take ; That day he did die , In his grave he did lie , And the Sexton the earth on him Rake . Come Prodigals , your selves that loves to flatter , Behold my fallen , that with the Fork does scatter . To the tune of , To drive the cold winter away . ROome , room for a friend , That his money will spend , old Flatcap is laid in his grave , He kept me full poor , But now I will roar , his lands and his livings I have , The tide of gold flows , And wealth on me grows , hee's dead , and for that 'tis no matter , Great use he did take . And for me did rake , which now with the fork I will scatter . I now must turn gallant , That have such a talon , what need I to take any care , I tell thee good friend , 'Tis mine own which I spend , for I was my Father's own heir : No Blade here shall lack , Give us claret and sack , hang pinching , it is against nature , Let's have all good cheer , Cost it never so deer , for I with my fork will scatter . Let me have a Lass That fair Venus does pass , give me all delights that I may , I'll make my gold fly Aloft in the sky , I think it will never be day : Let the welkin roar , I'll never give o're , Tobacco , and with it strong water , I mean for to drink , Until I do sink , for I with my fork will scatter . And let music play To me night and day , I scorn both my silver and gold , Brave gentlemen all , I'll pay what you call , with me I beseech you be bold : Dice run low or high , My Gold it shall fly , I mean for to keep a brave quarter , Let the Cards go and come , I have a great sum , That I with my fork will scatter . Let Carouses go round , Till some fallen to the ground , and here's to my Mistress her health Then let's take no care , For no cost wee'l spare , hang money , I have store of wealth , My Father it god . And now fallen to my lot , I scorn it as I do mortar ; For coin was made round , To stand on no ground , And I with my fork will it scatter . My Lordship's to fell , I think would do well , ill got goods never do thrive : Let's spend while we may , Each Dog hath his day , I'll want not while I am alive : Come Drawers , more sack , And see what we lack , for money I'll send a porter , Brave gallants ne're fear For wee'l domineer , For I with my fork will scatter . Come , drink to my friend , And let the health end , my Coffers and Pockets are empty , I now have no more , That had wont to have store , ther's scarcity where there was plenty , My friends are all gone , And left me alone , I think I must now drink cold water : There's nought but sad woe , Upon me does grow , Because with my fork I did scatter . Now this is the story , Of prodigal glory , who thought that he never should lack No drink nor no meat , Now he hath to eat , nor clothes for to put on his back : His friends they forsake him , And woe does o're take him , because he was too free of nature , That never did mind , How time comes behind , who mows , though with fork he did scatter . His leaves they grew green , But they were not seen , for Autumn them quickly did kill , Then let youth beware , And have a great care , and trust not too much to their will lest a prison them catch , Or a house without thatch , and glad of brown bred & cold water To God thanks lets give , And in a mean live , having a care how we do scatter .
