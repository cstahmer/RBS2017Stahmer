MAJESTY In MISERY , OR , AND IMPLORATION TO THE KING OF KINGS Written by his late MAJESTY King CHARES the first , during His Captivity at Carisbrook - Castle , Anno DOM . 1648. GREAT Monarch of the World , from whose Power springs The Potency and Power of KINGS , Record the Royal Woe my Suffering brings ; And Teach my Tongue , that ever did Confine It's Faculties in truths Seraphic Line , To Track the Treasons of Thy Foes and mine . Nature and Law , by the Divine Decree ( The only Root of Righteous Loyalty ) With this Dim Diadem Invested me , With it , the Sacred Sceptre , Purple Robe , The Holy Unction , and the Royal Globe : Yet am I Levell'd with the Life of JOB . The fiercest Furies , that do daily Tread Upon my Grief , my Grey Discrowned Head , Are those that owe my Bounty for their Bred . They raise a War , and christian it , The Cause , While Sacrilegious Hands have best Applause , Plunder , and Murder , are the Kingdoms Laws ; Tyranny , bears the Title of Taxation ! Revenge , and Robbery , are Reformation ! Oppression , gains the Name of Sequestration ! My Loyal Subject's who in this bad Season Attend me ( by the Law of GOD and Reason ) They do Impeach , and Punish for High Treason . Next at the Clergy do their Furies Frown , Pious Episcopacy must go down , They will Destroy the Crosser and the Crown . Churchmen are Chain'd , and Schismatics are free'd ! Mechanics Preach , and Holy Father's Bleed , The Crown is Crucified with the Creed . The Church of England does all Faction Foster , The Pulpit is Usurp'd by each Imposter , Ex Tempore Excludes the Pater Noster . The Presbyter and Independent Seed , Springs with Broad Blades ; to make Religion Bleed , Herod and Pontius Pilate are Agreed . The Cornerstone is Mis-plac'd by every Pavior , With such a Bloody Method and Behaviour , Their Ancestors did Crucify our Saviour . My Royal Consort , from whose Fruitful Womb , So many Princes Legally have come , Is forc'd in Pilgrimage to seek a Tomb. Great Britain's HEIR is forced into France , While on his Father's Head his Foes Advance , Poor Child ! He weeps out His Inheritance . With My own Power My Majesty they wound , In the KING's Name , the King Himself's Uncrown'd : So does the Dust Destroy the Diamond . Which Propositions Daily they Enchant My Peoples Ears , such as do Reason daunt , And the Almighty will not let Me Grant . They promise to Erect My Royal Stem , To make Me great , t' Advance My Diadem , If I will first fallen Down , and Worship them ; But for Refusal they Devour My Thrones , Distress My Children , and Destroy My Bones , I fear they'l Force Me to make Bred of Stones . My Life they prize at such a slender Rate That in My Absence they draw Bills of Hate , To prove the KING a Traitor to the State . Fellows obtain more Privilege then I , They are Allow'd to Answer e're they Die , 'Tis Death for Me to Ask the Reason , Why ! But , Sacred Saviour , with My Words I Echo Thee to Forgive , and not be Bitter to Such , as thou know'st do not know what they do . For since they from their LORD are so Disjointed , As to Condemn those Edicts He Appointed , How can they Prize the Power of His Anointed ? Augment my Patience , Nullify my Hate , Preserve My Issue , and Inspire My Mate , Yet though We Perish , Bless the Church and State . Vota dabunt que Bella negerunt . Bona agere , & Mala pati Regium est . Written by His Majesties own Hand . London Printed by Order .
