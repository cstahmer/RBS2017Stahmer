THE CLOCK and CUSHION . TUNE of , All in the Land of CYDER . ALL in the Town of Ailsbury , The Truth you may rely on , Such a TRICK was play'd . By a Sanctify'd Blade , That all the SAINTS cry'd , Fie on ! This Man was full of RELIGION , Tho' hard 'twas to be traced ; Whither BAXTER's Schemes , Or BUNYAN's Dreams , Were most by him embraced . Of Zeal he had so much on't , At Church he'd sometime show it ; And there very low At the Altar bow , When Profit call'd him to it ; Tho' at other Times it appear'd , How much he did abhor it ; Thought the truest Spouse Was the Meeting-House , And zealous he was for it . The NON-CON Cause he lov'd so well , Such to it was his Bounty , That a CLOCK he gave , And CUSHION so brave , The like was not in the County . This Gift he much applauded , And said , 'Twas wondrous ample , That since He himself , Was so free of his Pelf , Hop'd others wou'd take the Example . But mark what the Story says now ; Two Candidates did stand , Sir , , Who gave ten Guineas This CLOCK to finish , And put 'em into his Hands , Sir ; While he to show good Management , Made Three to serve the Purpose ; The other Seven , He nick'd with Eleven , And put them into his own Purse . The CUSHION too which was placed For Holy Men to thump on't , That now was found , Of his Wives Old Gown , To be only made of the RUMP on' The SAINTS they were now all alarm'd , To find themselves beguiled , Resolv'd to defeat This Achan-like Deceit , That the Camp should not be defiled . Then all at once they discarded Both him and eke his Present ; The CUSHION too , They compel'd to go , And move off with the Movement . THE CLOCK and CUSHION . TUNE of , All in the Land of CYDER .
