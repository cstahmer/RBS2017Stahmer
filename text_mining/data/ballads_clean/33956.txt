( 252 ) A VINDICATION of M [ r . ] DUNCAN LIDDEL , And his Son GEORGE LIDDEL , The on Professor of the Mathematics , and the other a Student of Philosophy , and John Forbes , Printer to the University and Town of Aberdeen , by way of Answer of a scourrilious Rhyme sent from Edinburgh . To the Tune of , The Gentleman's Mear is behind . And Answer too that mad men Rhyme Will prove and Horse at fooling time , And if that fail he'l turn and Ass , As Ferrier's count at the next grass . WHat makes the foolish Coxcomb so to carp , Like too a foisting Cur can nought but bark At him who is profoundly learn'd in all ; Not only speculative , but practical Parts of the Mathematics ( which fool you ) Knows even as much as does a Beetle be : But grant you had some skill as you have none , Then I would ask at you this Question , What is the difference 'twixt and current day ? And on complete if this you know , I say , Your ignorance you had not so bewray'd , Nor in your judgement had so much decay'd , [ A ] s not to know the difference , I say , Betwixt th' Artificial and the natural day . [ If ] this ye'd known as you pretend to do , [ Y ] e had confessed our Feasts both right and true . [ TO ] he first , the third of March which cannot fail ; [ TO ] hen without doubt the ninetenth of April . [ TO ] he second holds as you may read and see , [ C ] onfirm'd by Vincent Wing , and Gadburry . [ Y ] our weakness Sir you very much discover [ ? ] or to prove Easter by the Jews Pashover : [ B ] ut I with pardon this much most tell you [ ? ] greater things I fear ye're too much Jew . [ A ] s for your Hebrew it's not very good , [ W ] hen you mistake month Nisan for Abib . [ B ] ut tho it were as you would hav't to be ; [ ? ] nothing proves as all learn'd men agree ; [ A ] lthough good Friday fallen near the full Moon ; [ Y ] et still it holds not so , as may be seen [ TO ] his present year , which I think none will doub [ ? ] tO you good Sir , whose wit is in your snout , [ W ] hen Christ our Saviour suffered on the Cross , [ ? ] e know that darkness was miraculous ; [ ? ] tO that proves nothing to the thing in hand . [ And ] worser so I hope your Worship's at and stand ; [ ? h ] en I conclude whoever you informs [ M ] ost justly does deserve a pair of Horns , [ ? ] at the least to have the same reward [ W ] hich Midas had : and what is that ye've herd ? [ ? ] tO I perceive who sees you well without [ ? ] s all he can expect ; for without doubt [ ? ] 's nought within , but a poor empty House ; A Lodging hardly worthy a Mouse : But had you knowledge as you apprehend Yourself to have , then truly I would send Some lines unto you of and deeper die ; But to and naughty shallow Fellow , I Thinks it below my wrath ; because I know Ther's nought within you to yourself you owe , But other learned Men's works that you steel . Which sure I am you understand not well ; And here I will a Lesson you prescribe , If you be wise , no longer for to dyve In matters to Antarctic to your brain ; Or in the least compet with learned Men , Whose Books you are not worthy for to bear , Should make you keep within your proper sphere To wit the Dung Hill , which sympathizes best , With your dull brains , and there resolve to rest ; Because these heavenly Bodies which we see Goes far beyond thy gross capacity . Your Prima Coruu which is in your Rhyme Holds forth your Grammar not to be so prime As you would hav't , believed since there are none Have learn'd the Rudiments , but knows its wrong . I know by prima stella's understood ; But you do lake ( In And ) to make it good , And right construction , which plainly shows Your Latin is no better then a Cows . What are these Problems ? twelve I do not know Ye've answered him , he only you but two , To lie so grossly holds you forth more base Then any horned Ox or surdid Ass . Next you bring in to back your lies old Lily ; Had you a tail ye'd make a complete filly , For Lily our Professor know to be As great a Master of the Art as he ; Although these juggling tricks he did not use , Which Lily did poor people to abuse , Erecting figures of Astrology To cheat them , had not knowledge of their money . If Master Duncan pleased to contend With on like you , ther's none needs him defend ; But that he think's it below him to contest , With either hummel or with horned beast . Now of this Matter for to make and end With our Professor do not more contend , Whose skill and knowledge in Astronomy , And all the secrets of Astrology Is known to be so great , that there are few . Will dare to challeng't , but and Ass like you ; Since all the learn'd Professors of this Art , In Britan or in whatsomever part , Both will and have acknowledged and confessed , He is not inferior to the very best . As for George Liddel whose years do not arrive As yet unto the Number of four times five . Most shameful hath put you to the foil , And made you back upon your breach recoil Whose printed Problems plain and clearly show , Which yet are extant to the public is view I think , and so should ever wise Man too ; You should desist from railing as you do . Whereas you talk of George to tun their fiddel , Assure yourself e're long ye's have a Riddel Shall tun you well enough , but that I fear Your madness spoil your brains e'r you come there . As for our Printer you strive too abuse , Who is a Gentleman , and does not use To rail on any man , but no thing's true . I hope he's nothing yet behind with you ; But that he thinks't below him to contest With you that loves to rail and lie at best . If I had thought thee worthy of my Pen , I could have written in and higher strain ; But for and Blockhead this is good enough , Whose learning fits him better for the plough , Then for to strain his Rustic brainet so high , As touch at Matters of Astronomy . If I esteem'd Thee better than a Slav , I'd take in hand ro Rhyme thee to thy Grave . Your empty head's no better then a stock , Fit for to be and Haberdascher's block ; And shall I speak more properly my mind , At best ye're but a bladder blown with wind . But I'le conclude , take head to your self , In case you splite upon a Northern shelf ; Since I have power to make and Storm arise , Shall quite destract you if ye'l not be wise .
