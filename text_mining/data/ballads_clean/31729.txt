The Distressed Damsels ; OR , A doleful Ditty of a sorrowful Assembly of young Maidens that were met together near Thames-street , to bewail the Loss of their Loves which were lately press'd away to Sea. To the Tune of and Orange . Licensed according to Order . MY sweet Sister Sue , ah ! what I shado ? I I fain wou'd be married but know not I to who ; For why , I protest , the young Men are Pressed , And my Sweetheart Robin is gone with the rest For a Seaman . Then Susan reply'd there's many beside , That Fortune this Summer will surely divide ; Each sudden surprise will cause Lasses cries , While Tears they do trickle like Rain from the Skies , For our Sweethearts . There's Bess at the Bell you know her full well , A sorrowful story to me she did tell , That Thomas her Dear , was Pressed she did hear , And then the poor Creature did tremble for fear He should leave her . In Thames-street of late , young pretty-fac , d Kate Had lost her dear sweating , the Bricklayer her Mate ; He was pressed away but yet the next day They freed him , then Kate she did lovingly say . My sweet Johnny . In the open Street her John she did meet , And gave him a thousand soft Kisses so sweet , With stroking his Chin , she welcom'd him in , For Joy she was fit to leap out of her Skin , For her Johnny . There's Doll at the Swan , her true Love is gone , Poor Heart she with sorrow does sighs and take on ; Yet all is in vain , he is gone to the Main , She fears that he ne'er will return home again , To embrace her . There's Bridget & Joan 'tis very well known , Of Fourteen young Sweethearts they have not left one But all Pressed on Board for to stand by the Sword , And this do's much Sorrow and Trouble afford , At the Parting . If Pressing goes on , there wont be a Man To please a young Lass , let her do what she can , For they will be scarce here in a short space , Then we shall be all in a sorrowful case , To be Married . Two Twelvemonths ago , swee [ tO Sister you know ] The Bachelors then we could [ bring to our Bow ] Nay , at our Command , they [ stood Cap in Hand ] But now they grow scarcy all o [ ver the Land ] We must prize them . Young Nancy and Ned [ last week they were Wed , ] And within and hour of g [ oing to Bed , ] Just in all their Pride he [ was Pressed from her side , ] Before he had dallied one Ni [ ght with his Bride ] Want it Pity ? To leave his delight , a [ and Beuaty so bright ] Before he had ever enjoy'd [ her one Night ] But what shall we say ?
