Wou'd you be a man off Favour , wou'd you have your Fortune kind , Were the Cross and eatt the Wafer , and you'l have all things to your mind , If the Priest cannot convert you , Interest then must do the thing , there be Friars Can inform you how too please a Po King . Wou'd you see the Papist Lowering Lost in a hurry and a fright And there Father Peters scouring Glad of Times happy flight ; Stay but till the Duch are Landed And the Sho will soon appear , When the Infernal Court's Disbanded Few will stay for Harbour hear A NEW SONG .
