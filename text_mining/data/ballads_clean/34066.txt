[ 1 ] THE PROLOUGE TO King WILLIAM & Queen MARY , At a Play Acted before Their Majesties at Whitehall , on Friday the 15th of November 1689. Written by N. TATE . WHILE Britain's State Her Monarch does support , Protects Her Liberties , adorns Her Court , Confirms Her Laws ; the Muses Tribe would wrong The Public Int'rest to detain him long . Yet , with His grateful Subject's they implore Their Hour of Thanks , ------ even Them He did Restore . To Them and Their Lov'd Swains did safety bring , Permits Their Flocks to Feed , and Them to Sing . No Lambs shall now for Foreign Altars bleed , The Flock , the Fleece , the Shepherd's too are freed . He Scorn'd all Danger , for Fair Britain's Aid , ( To Roman Zeal , a ready Victim laid , ) And with His Peril , sav'd the helpless Maid . Belgia , that next Devoted was to Fallen , Did for the same Advent'rous Courage call , He Fac'd our Common Fears ------ Outbrav'd both Seas and Foes , to rescue All ! So HERCULES , when Monsters did infest , Commenc'd His Toils to give the Nations rest . Such Pious Valour justly is Ador'd , And well may different Tongues , that had implor'd His Guardian-Aid , consent to call him Lord . Fortune and Chance , elsewhere may show their Powers , Give Kingdoms Lords , but Providence gives Ours ! Our kind Restorer first , who , to maintain Our rescu'd Freedom , Condescends to Reign . For Albion's Wounds a Sov'raign Balm decreed , But Heav'n not sent Him , 'till the utmost Need , To make its Champion Priz'd , and let Him lay Engagements , such as we cou'd never Repay . His Fame's vast only Price was his before , MARIA's Charms --------- Empire cou'd add no more , Nature in Her exhausted all its Store . What we confer , on Us descends again , Who wait the ripening Blessings of his Reign : Saturnian Days revolve , of former Crimes If any Seeds molest our Halcyon Times , And Rouse our Mars , on him lies all the Care , Defence and Freedom never were bought too Dear . He only Arms to make our Dangers cease , His Wars are Glorious , for his End is Peace . The Muses once were Sacred , give 'em leave , One Vote for Britain's Welfare to conceive ; They Sum Their Wishes up , in one short Pray'r , ( Join all True Hearts ) Long Live the ROYAL PAIR . FINIS . LICENSED , Novemb. 16. 1689. J. FRASER . LONDON , Printed for F. Saunders , at the Blue Anchor in the Lower Walk of the New Exchange , and Published by R. Baldwin in the Old Baily , 1689.
