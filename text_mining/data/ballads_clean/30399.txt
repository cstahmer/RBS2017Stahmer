WHen William Duke of Normandy With all his Normans gallantly this Kingdom did subdue ; Full fifteen years of age I was , And what e're since hath come to pass , I can report for true . I can remember since he went From London for to Conquer Kent . where with a walking Wood , The men of Kent compassed him , And he for aye confirm'd to them King Edwards Laws for good . Likewise , I William Rufus knew , And saw the Arrow that him slew hard by a Forest side : [ I ] well could tell if I list , Or better tell you if I wist , who next to him did ride . First Henry I , and Stephen knew , Who no man here but I did view , I saw them Crown'd and dead ; I can remember well also , The second Henry's Royal show , that day that he was Wed. I likewise was at Woodstock Bower , And saw that sweet and famous flower , Queen Elenor so did spite ; I found the clew of thread again , After that worthy Knight was slave , 'twas green , blue , read and white . I saw King Richard in his shirt Pull out a furious Lyons heart , whereby his strength was try'd ; I saw King John , when as the Monk , Gave him the Poison which he drunk , and then forsooth he dy'd .

I saw the White , [ a ] and Red-Rose fight And Warwick gre [ at ] in Armour bright , in the sixth Henr [ y' ] s Reign : And present was tO [ hat ] very hour , When Henry was [ in ] London Tower , by crook'd-back Richard slave . I in a Goldsmith [ 's Sh ] open have seen , Fourth Edwards f [ a ] mous Concubine whose name was fair Jane Shore : I saw when Rich [ are ] ds cruelty Did put her to g [ re ] at misery , and I was gri [ ev ] 'd therefore Also I was at Bosworth field , Well armed there with spear and shield meaning to try my force : Where Richard losing Life and Crown , Was naked born to Leicester Town , upon a Colliars Horse . To the seventh Henry then I was , A servant , as it came to pass to serve him at his need : And while I did in Court remain , I saw in the eighth Henry's Reign , full many great men bleed . I as a Soldier bold with him O're Neptune's curled breast did swim unto the Realm of France : I helped to ransack Bulloign Town , And many places of Renown , yet home I came by chance . I knew first Edward of a Child , Whose countenance was very mild , a hopeful Prince he was : I knew Queen Marry in her Reign , Put Protestants to much pain , and reset up the Mass. And ( to my comfort ) I have seen ; Elizabeth that Maiden-Queen , Queen Mary's only Sister : Though she raign'd four and forty years Her Subject's shew'd well by their tears , that they too soon had [ ? ] tO her . I saw King James come from the North Like to a Star that shines forth , to glad the Peoples sighs He brought a Salve to cure our wounds , And made Great Brittain safe and found , through equity and right .
