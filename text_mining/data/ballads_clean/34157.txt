C : RB . I.262 ( 024 ) A CONGRATULATION For His Sacred Majesty , CHARLES , the third Monarch of Great Britain , His happy Arrival at WHITEHALL . By a Loyal Member of His Majesties Army . Edinburgh , June 13. 1660. BE gone dark shadows of a gloomy nigh Pack hence you furious Bugbears which affright Weak humane fancies ; banish sullen fears , State-Tempests now are still , fair Calms appears : Heav'ns are serene , Faces and Hearts rejoice ; Weigh Anchor Mariners , your Sails up-hoise , And steer your Royal Vessel to that Port , Where Loyal Hearts in Myriads shall resort ; Where every Knee shall bow , each Tongue shall cry Blessed Encomiums to His MAJESTY . BREDAH adieu , our DOVER longs to see That Face , where's mounted Sovereign Majesty ; That Heart where Love enthroned sits and lives , And greatest Injuries forgets , forgives ; That Magazine of Humane Policy , Pattern of Patience , Prudence , Piety : Once the Contempt , but now the World's great Wonder ; A King of Peace , and yet a King of Thunder : A Son of Suffering , but now Triumphing , By Patience learn't the Art of Overcoming : O're rigid Frowns , and feigned Smiles from those , Pretended Friendship , prov'd His greatest Foes . But stay ! methinks I see our ENGLANDS SUN , Great BRITAINS Glory , in's Meridian , Within the Royal Palace of WHITEHALL , Conducted by our Noble GENERAL ; Whose Valour , Prudence , and Fidelity , Deserves that GEORGE of ENGLAND styl'd he be : Who Prince , and People , Liberties and Laws Hath now restor'd from the Usurping Paws Of false Pretenders . Who shall write his Story ? Puts Kings and Kingdoms in their Native Glory . Long live King CHARLES the Great , the Good , the Just , Blessed in His Subject's , happy in His Trus Long may His Princely Sceptre bear Command , Over our Kingdoms both by Sea and Land. Thrice welcome our Dread Sovereign , King of Hearts , This is the Common Suffrage from all Parts : Both High and Low , both Rich and Poor , they sing Rejoicing Eccho's for their Sacred King . Possess and Rule , inherit what's Your own , You'r BRITAINS Glory , and Your Subject's Crown ; Which done , Posterities to come shall tell , King CHARLES the Second's without Parallel . FINIS .
