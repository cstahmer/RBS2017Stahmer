No Seaman fears to loose his Blood , To justify a cause so good ; To fight the French , who have begun With burning of poor Tinmouth Town . The Cornish Lads will lend a hand , And Devonshire Boys will with them Band , To pull the pride of Monsieur down , Who basely burn'd poor Tinmouth Town . To our most Gracious King and Queen , Their Loyalty it shall be seen ; With heart and hand they vow to fight , For to maintain King William's Right . I wish such Loyal hearts be found , In all the Counties England Round ; Then let the French-men us approach , Their Brandy Vessels we will broach . We hope our Fleet will prove most just , In not betraying of their Trust , [ That ] en the French shall pay full soar , [ For ] Trespassing on our English-shore . If in our hands they once do fallen , They certainly shall pay for all , The WORSER [ a ] mage done , in beating down , And burning of poor Tinmouth Town Dutch-men of War they will us meet , For to complete our Royal Fleet ; Which being done they will advance , For to pull down the pride of France . Let's pray kind Heaven for to bless , Our Gracious King with good success Then we shall all right happy be , For to Enjoy our Liberty . We will advance King William's fame , And add new Glorys to his name , The hawghty Monsieur we'll pluck down , For to advance Old Englands Crown . Now England is so powerful grown , Poor Monsieur Totters in his Throne , Brave Boys with Courage let's proceed , No English-man will fear to bleed . Then let proud French-men all bewail , That E're they did to England Sail , Not words but blows shall make it out , When we with them have 'tother bout . Printed for P. Brooksby , J. Deacon , J.
