A lamentable Ditty composed upon the Death of Robert Lord Devereux , late Earl of Essex , who was be - headed in the Tower of London , on Ashwenesday in the morning , 1600. To the tune of Welladay SWeet Englands pride is gone , welladay , welladay , Which makes her sighs and groan evermore still : He did her fame advance , in Ireland Spaine , and France , And now by dismal chance , is from us taken . He was a virtuous Peer , welladay , welladay , And was esteemed deer , evermore still : He always helped the poor . which makes them sighs full soar His death they do deplore , in every place . Brave honour grac'd him still . gallantly , gallantly , He never did deed of ill , well it is known , But Envy that foul fiend , whose malice never did end , Hath brought true virtues friend unto his thrall . At Tilt he did surpass , gallantly , gallantly , All men that is and was evermore still : One day as it was seen , in honour of our Queen , Such deeds hath never been seen , as he did doe . Abroad and eke at home , gallantly , gallantly , For valour there was none , like him before . In Ireland , France , and Spaine , they fear'd great Essex name , And England lov'd the same , in every place . But all would not prevail , welladay , welladay , His deeds did not avail , more was the pity : He was condem'd to die , for treason certainly , But God that sits on high , kneweth all things . That Sunday in the morn , welladay , welladay , That he to the City came , with all his troop : That first began the strife and caus'd him loose his life , And others did the like , as well as he , Yet her Princely Majesty , graci [ oh ] usly , graciously , Hath pardon given free , to many of them : She hath releas'd them quite , and given them their right , They may pray day and night , God to defend her . Shrovesunday in the night , welladay , welladay , With a heavy hearted sprite . as it is said : The Lieutenant of the Tower , who kept him in his power At ten a Cloak that hour , to him did come . And said unto him thore mournfully , mournfully , My Lord you must prepare , to die to morrow . Gods will be done quoth he , yet shall you strangely see , God strong in me to be , though I am weak . I pray you pray for me , welladay , welladay , That God may strengthen me , against that hour : Them straightway he did call to the Guard under the wall And did entreat them all for him to pray . For to morrow is the day , welladay , welladay , That I the dept must pay , which I do owe : It is my life I mean , which I must pay my Queen Even so hath Justice given , that I must die . In the morning he was he brought welladay , welladay , Where a Scaffold was set up within the Tower : Many Lords were present then , with other Gentlemen , Which were appointed then , to see him die , You Noble Lords quoth he , welladay , welladay . That must the witness be , of this my death : Know I never lov'd Papistry , but still did it defy , And Essex thus will die , here in this place , I have a sinner been , welladay , welladay , Yet never wrong'd my Queen , in all my life : My God I did offend , which grieves me at my end , May all the rest amend , I do forgive them . To the State I never meant ill , welladay , welladay , Neither wished the Commons ill , in all my life : But lov'd all with my heart , and always took their part , Whereas there was desert , in any place Then mildly did he crave , mournfully , mournfully , He might that favour have , private to pray : He then prayed heartily , and with great fervency , To God that sits on high , for to receive him . And then he prayed again , mournfully , mournfully , God to preserve his Queen from all her foes ; And send her long to reign , true Justice to maintain , And not to let proud Spaine . once to offend her . His Gown he slipped off then welladay , welladay , And put off his hat and band , and hung them by : Praying still continually , to God that sits on high , That he might patiently , there suffer death . My headsman that must be , then said he cheerfully , Let him come here to me , that I may him see , Who kneeled to him then , art thou quoth he the man , Which art appointed now , my life to free . Yes my Lord did he say , welladay , welladay , Forgive me , I you pray , for this your death , I here do you forgive , and may true Justice live , No foul crime to forgive , within their place . Then he kneeled down again , mournfully , mournfully , And was required by some there standing by To forgive his enemies , before death close his eyes , Which he did in hearty wise , thanking them for it . That they would remember him welladay , welladay , That he might forgive all them that had him wrong'd , Now my Lords I take my leave sweet Christ my soul receive Now when you will prepare , for I am ready . He laid his head on the bloke welladay , welladay , But his Doublet let the stroke some there did say ; What must be done quoth he , shall be done presently , Then his doublet off put he , and lay down again . Then his headsman did his par [ tO ] cruelly , cruelly , He was never seen to start , for all the blows : His soul it is at rest . in heaven among the blessed Where God send us to rest , when it shall please him .
