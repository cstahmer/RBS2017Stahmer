ENGLANDS Happy State : Or , the Subject's Joy , for the Election Of a New PARLIAMENT : Brave English Hearts your joys Complete , And Loyal prove to James the Great , So may you still most happy be , A and Flourish in Prosperity . To the Tune of , Now Now the Fights Done : N Owe raise up your spirits brave English men , For I hope you will see happy times here again , Since James our Great King gives his Royal consent , And order the calling a New PARLIAMENT : Then let us Rejoice and most cheerfully sing , That never were people more blessed with a King . And under his Banner we boldly will Fight , His rights to maintain by day and by night , To show our Allegiance we'll do our endeavour , In Loyalty still we will strive to persever : and like faithful Subject's most cheerfully sing , that never were people more blessed in a King . Such brave Loyal men some say there are chosen , They'll encourage our friends , and astonish our foes , Gods belssings and mercy's upon them attend , That poor Englands troubles may once have and end ; then all Loyal Subject's will cheerfully sing , God bless James the Second our Sovereign King . In time we may floursih again as before , Since God hath some mercies for England in store , That under our Prince we may Flourish and thrive , And found forth his goodness while we do survive : so may Loyal Subject's most cheerfully sing , that never , etc Were England but freed from all strife and sedition , Oh then they would be in a happy condition , When Subject's do freely their Princes obey , No souls under Heaven more happy then they : then all Loyal Subject's most cheerfully sing , God bless James , etc Such persons are chosen for P arliament-Men , You'll find but few such in all Europe again ; Such persons indeed are most fit to assemble , To make the Kings foes for to fear and to tremble : that all Loyal Subject's may merrily sing , no people , etc Whats wanting dear Souls your hearts to rejoice , You now have your freedom to make a good choice , And Loyalists now in your splendour appear , To serve both your Country and Sovereign dear , that you in Conclusion may merrily sings , no Subject's , etc Nor can we be Crowned with more Happiness , Then a King whom the Heavens is pleased for to bless . O let us be thankful by night and by day , And for his prosperity heartily pray ; then let Loyal Subject's most merrily sing , that never , etc And thus to conclude , I all men do advice , To be Loyal and true , to be merry and wise , A Nation divided it's pity to see , But happy when all in one mind do agree ; then brave L oyal Subject's will merrily sing , that never were people more blessed in a KING .
