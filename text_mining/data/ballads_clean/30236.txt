A New Ballad ; declaring the Excellent Parable of the Prodigal Child , To the Tune of , The wanton wife [ . ] THere was a grave man both wealthy and wise , two Sons had both proper and tall , The elder was very proper and very precise , The other to wildness did wholly incline , his Parents therefore was grieved full soar , And mighty displeasure against him they boar , Young Men remember delights are but vain , And after sweet pleasure comes sorrow & pain . This lusty brave youngster that lives at ease , and never had tasted the temper of care , Quoth he , if my doings your mind do displease , then give me my portion that falls to my share , then you shall not be long troubled with me , Yet will I live gallant and pleasant , quoth he , Young Men , etc O , quoth his Parents , you wicked lewd Lad , What will become of thee where thou shalt go ; Seeing thy Government it is so bad , But misery and beggary upon thee shall grow , Quoth he , if I knew that this would be true , Be sure i would never make moan unto you , Young Men , etc His Parents that saw him put him to flight , Paid him his Portion without all delay : Saying , Good Sir , I pray take your flight . I mean not , quoth he , in your presence to stay , But now I will see each Foreign Country , And view the world what fashions there be , Young Men , etc Thus in his jollity he rides along , and in his apparel most sumptuous and brave , To view this brave Gallant much people did throng where he like a Prince himself did behave , Yea honoured was he , with cap and with knee , And at his command the proudest now be , Young Men , etc With music each morning his ears they fed , of Gold and Silver he makes no spare , With flattering Speeches away he was led , his body is fed with delicate fare : What he does require he hath at his desire , But such as want money may lie in the mire , Young Men , etc Proper fine women of beauty most bright , do strive for his favour and friendship each day , They call him their honey , their joy and delight , they kiss him , they cull him , and wantonly play , They swear till they die tho' falsely they lie , He shall be their Sweetheart & pretty Pigs-nigh , Young Men , etc Some gave him Handkerchiefs , some gave Rings , Some strew'd him [ s ] windows with flowers so sweet , Some to delight him both dances and sings , Some with Rose water does wash his feet , And what shall I say they took him away , They woo him , & do him what Kindness they may , Young Men , etc Thus with their allurements , their winks & their wiles they used to bewitch this Prodigal Boy , He buys with gold angels their Kisses & Smiles , And stores them with every new fangle and toy , He buys them new Gowns and many fair pounds In white-wine & sugar among them he drowns , Young Men , etc When he had upon them thus wasted his wealth , Consumed his substance , his treasure and store , Yea , cracked all his credit with hazard of health , That he could banquet these minions no more , With words of despite , they fly from his sighed , They call him base Rascal forsaking him quite , Young Men remember delights are but vain , & after sweet pleasure comes sorrow and pain , The Second Part , showing the great Misery he endured , being constrained thro' hunger to Eat with the Hogs , and how his merciful Father received him again . To the same Tune . THen was he brought to misery great , His garments all ragged and torn you might see His body near starved for want of good meat his Clothes out at elbows , his hose broke at knee , And in his distress he knew no redress , His Harlots spit at him in his heaviness , Young Men remember delights are but vain , And after sweet pleasure comes sorrow and pain , Then bitterly mourning he went up and down , to get him a Master that he might dine : At length a Rich Citizen dwelling in town , sends him to the country to keep all his Swine , Whose hunger was great , for want of good meat He sat him down by the hogs husks for to ea Young Men , etc And as by the hogs he was feeding apace , with many a sighs and sob he did say , Now I am brought to a pitiful case , alack that my Parents I did disobey , their servants at home , the very worst Groom , Have meat & drink plenty & here I have none , Young Men , etc Wherefore to my father again I will go , asking him forgiveness for my lewd life , Showing to him my grief and my woe , Reputing my folly that it set at strife : Then straight the same day , he takes his way , And came to his father's in Ragged array . Young Men , etc With bitter mourning he falls on his knee , saying , Dear Father , forgive what is done , For I have offended Christ Jesus and thee , Unworthy I am to be called thy Son : Yet do not disdain to take me again . As one of thy servants to take any pain ; Young Men , etc with that the tears fell from his father's eyes , with joy and gladness they flew full fast , He Kissed his Son , and bid him arise , saying , I have found my child that was lost , with Garments full gay he did him array , and killed a fat Calf to honour that day , Young Men , etc And gently led him by the hand , great joy and melody there was made , But when his eldest brother did understand the truth of every thing that hath been said , Full angry was he when this he did see . His prodigal brother thus honoured would be , Young Men , etc And to his Father thus he did speak , Long have I served thee and many a day , And thy Commandments never did break , but all my life long I did thee obey ; Yet never found I such great Courtesy as this wretched Unthrift that let his wealth fly Young Men , etc O , quoth his Father , consider my Son , All that I have one day shall be thine , then do not grudge at what I have done , Nor at thy poor Brother do thou repine ; For he was lost plain , but is found again , He was dead , but now is risen again , Young Men , etc this worthy Parable Christ he did tell , Unto the Comforters of Christians each one , Altho' by our wickedness we do rebel , Yet by true Repentance our Father of Heaven , Does pity our case , receiving us to grace , In joys everlasting with him to take place , Young men remember delights are but vain , And after sweet pleasures come sorrow and pain .
