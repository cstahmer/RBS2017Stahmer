A New SONG : Called The two Loyal Lovers Joy Completed . She seemed to slight her Hearts delight , which caused him to complain : But when she see his Loyalty , she made him glad again . Tune of , Oh so ungrateful a Creature . This may be Printed , R.P. ( 1 ) ONe Evening in Summer season , when each Lad walks with his Lass In the cool shades , which are pleasing , [ a ] s by a Grove I did pass , My wandering fancy contenting , musing my self all alone , I herd a youngman lamenting , making this sorrowful moan . ( 2 ) Oh cruel Maid ! thus to slight me whom you once loved so dear ; There is no thing can delight me , since my Fate is so severe , Just in the height of my Blessing to turn my Pleasure to Pain ; And when I should be possessing , torture me with her disdain . ( 3 ) You little Birds that flock hither , and in this Grove do abide , Witness how oft she vowed never nothing our Hearts should divide : Yet now her love it is ended , and I the cause cannot tell ; If I have ever offended , [ it ] was in loving too well . ( 4 ) When I with Sorrow surrounded move her to pity my pain , The more I sue I am wounded with the Darts of her disdain : If that the Love of another makes her deny me Relief , Yet I for ever will love her , [ though ] ugh she's the cause of my grief . ( 5 ) [ O ] [ you ] kind Powers befriend me , [ a ] and in her Breast pity move , That she some Comfort may send me , since I so constant do prove : TO [ h ] oug [ h ] she gives me a denial , [ that ] us by her unconstancy , Yet I will ever be loyal , and her true Lover will die . ( 6 ) When he had ended this Ditty , he was about to depart ; Then a young Damsel most pretty out of a Bush there did start , Who to the youngman then going , Let not sad Grief thee annoy : Thus she said while Tears was flowing with the Excess of her Joy . ( 7 ) Dearest , since I unperceived herd you your passion [ e ] xpress , And thereby my doubts relieved , now I the truth will confess : To try your Love I denied you , which since I find to be [ tO ] ru [ e ] ; I will love no one beside [ y ] ou , therefore bid Sorrow [ ad ] ieu . ( 8 ) Though I did seem so ungrateful as your true Love to disdain , Yet in my Heart I was faithful , and so I still will remain : Happy is she my dear Jewel , that such a Lover can find ; Ah! who could ever be cruel to one so constant and kind ? ( 9 ) All the sad grief you endured was for my sake I do know ; Therefore you may be assured that I my Heart will bestow On thee without a denial ; witness you Powers above , That I will ever be loyal and true to thee my dear Love . ( 10 ) Thus with sweet Kisses expressing unto the youngman her mind , Who wrapped with Joy such a Blessing so unexpected to find , Gave her a Thousand sweet Kisses , both their Joys then was complete . There is no Maiden , but wishes such a true Lover to meet Printed for J. Bissel at the Bible and Harp in West Smithfield . A New SONG : Called The two Loyal Lovers Joy Completed .
