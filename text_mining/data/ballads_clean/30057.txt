v The Despairing Lover , Whose mind was much tormented , Because of his True-Love He thought he was prevented . To the tune of , Aim not too high . Break heart and die , I may no longer live , To enjoy this world nothing that I will give , I live forlorn my joys are from me fled , I have lost my love , alack my heart is dead . Each thing on earth continueth with his Love , The pretty Pigeon and the Turtle Dove , And diverse others in the world I know , But my Love will not seem to love me so . I little thought what now I true do find , I did not deem my Love would be unkind : But 'tis no news , for many prove untrue , And so does mine , for she bids me adieu . But seeing 'tis so , I'll turn a Palmer poor , And I will range abroad the World half over , To see if I can find some dismal Cave , There will I dwell , there will I make my grave . I will go travel in some other Land , To France , to Spaine , or Turkey out of hand , Where unto strangers there will I complain , How that my Love hath me unkindly slain . If I do land upon some other shore , Whereas no man did ever land before ; Then shall I think my self a happy man , Because my death no man shall understand . There will I write my fill of my true Love : Did I say true ? What fury did me move , To count her true , that always proves unkind , And is as fickle as the wavering wind ? Since she was fair and lovely in my sighed , She was my joy and all my hearts deligh But now her smiles are turn'd from frowns & i [ ? ] To kill my heart with woe is her desire . Bright Phoebus beams are darkened in the sky [ s ] When as the storms of Boreas do arise : Yet he does quickly shine after the rain , But my coy Mistress will not love again I would I were i th' midst of the Seas , In some broken Vessel if the Fates did please , Where neither love nor comfort can be found , But every hour expecting to be drown'd . My speeches all do but prolong my pain , For I did never sail the Ocean main : Nor will I suffer life in me to bide , So long to wait the time of wind or tide . Seeing 'tis so , toth' Wilderness I'll high , Among wild beasts , where I intend to die , Where Lyons , Bears , & other wild beasts mourn The Dragon , Elephant , and Unicorn . Thus many wishes have I wished in vain , But none of those will rid me out of pain : This piercing Poniard now shall end the strife , And kill my heart , that loathes this mortal life . This being spoken forth his Love did rush , Beholding him with many a changing blush : Oh hold quoth she , and hear what I must say , Do not despair , nor work thy lives decay . You Maidens fair I pray come lend and ear , And you shall hear how true she does appear : She gave him comfort in his troubled mind , And ever after proved loving kind . A constant and a kind Maid . Which saved a proper Youngman's life , And after proved his loving Wife . To the same tune . COntent thy self my love and do not die , Thy life I love , thy death I do defy ; Live then in joy , and seek to banish pain , Take a good heart , and I will love again . All things on earth does love its chosen Mate , And thou contenmest me and sayest I hate ; Men love by fancy , Birds they love by kind , Then fancy me and thou shalt favour find . For all the good that ever Craesus won , I will not seem to leave my love alone ; No , no , my Love , I will not prove untrue , Nor will I change my old friend for a new . Thou shalt not need to turn a Palmer poor , For I for thee have Gold and Silver store ; Instead of finding out a desert place Thou shalt have me within thine arms t'imbrace Thou shalt not travel to another Land , For I am she that am at thy command : Thou shalt my deer have no cause to complain , For I with joy thy Love will entertain . If thou hadst landed on some foreign shore , Then I would never have enjoy'd thee more : But being thou art here arriv'd with me Thou shalt not go hence dangers for to see . What wouldst thou write of me thine own true love , Fear not , my Love , for I will constant prove , I am thine own , and so thou still shalt find , To thee I will be loving , true , and kind . As I was fair and lovely in thy sighed , So will I prove thy joy and hearts delight , I will not seek my dearest love to kill , But I will yield unto thy wished will . Sweet I have listened to thy moans and cries , Weep thou no more but dry thy watered eyes : The storms are past and Sun Shines after rain And I do vow to love thee once again . If thou wertenberg in the raging Seas so wide , Upon a Dolphins back feign wouldst thou ride : Desiring Neptunes succour out of hand , To be thy Pilot to some certain Land. Sweet Love much danger does abroad ensue , The Seas and wilderness bid thou adue : Near seek to write , or think of wind or tide , But live with me , and I will be thy bride . O stay at home sweet Love , and go not there , Wild Beasts in pieces will thy body tear : When I behold them for to suck thy blood , They shall have mine , my Love , to do thee good . Loe thus to thee my Love I do make known , Vowing hereafter I will be thine own ; Lo stay thy hand my Love and do not kill Thy gentle heart , that I could love so well . Then strait he took his Love into his arms , Which had preserv'd him from such dangerous harms Welcome ( quoth he ) I love thee as my life , And quickly after he made her his wife . Thus have you herd my song of woe and joy , Let Maids and young men listen to't I pray : Make you no vows , but have a special care , For fear [ you ] wound your Mates with deep despair FINIS .

Sweet Love much danger does abroad ensue , The Seas and wilderness bid thou adue : Near seek to write , or think of wind or tide , But live with me , and I will be thy bride . O stay at home sweet Love , and go not there , Wild Beasts in pieces will thy body tear : When I behold them for to suck thy blood , They shall have mine , my Love , to do thee good . Loe thus to thee my Love I do make known , Vowing hereafter I will be thine own ; Lo stay thy hand my Love and do not kill Thy gentle heart , that I could love so well . Then strait he took his Love into his arms , Which had preserv'd him from such dangerous harms Welcome ( quoth he ) I love thee as my life , And quickly after he made her his wife . Thus have you herd my song of woe and joy , Let Maids and young men listen to't I pray : Make you no vows , but have a special care , For fear [ you ] wound your Mates with deep despair FINIS .
