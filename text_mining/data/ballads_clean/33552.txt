The Royal Recreation ; OR , King WILLIAM's Merriment . Showing , The manner of his Entertainment at a Country Farmer's House , in his Return from the Irish Wars . Tune of Let Caesar live long . Licensed according to Order . OLd Stories do tell us of notable things , Which has been transacted by Sovereign Kings , To make themselves merry , their Nobles likewise , As they in their Progress did ride in disguise : Those were the best days when great Kings they would be Jocose with their Subject's of e'ery degree . Yet none of our Kings that has govern'd of late , Has been so familiar as William the Great , Who's great Condescension when I call to mind , For which he is term'd , The Delight of Mankind : With Courage and Conduct he governs the Land , The meanest of Subject's find Grace at his hand . But setting aside all the Toils of the War , Where William the Great had so glorious a share ; When coming from Ireland , on the High way , For Merriment he at a Farmers would stay : The King and his Nobles they all did alight , The Maid in the House stood amaz'd at this sighed . In all Towns and Places the Subject's did throng , To see our good King as he passed along ; This Farmer a Horseback was gone with his Wife , For why , she had ne'er seen a King in her Life : The Daughter alone at his House did remain , To wait on King William and his Courtly Train . She scarce e'er before god a Kiss of a Man , But now they come trooping Will , Robin and Jan , Each Thrasher and Miller concluding that he Should then look as great as a Lord in degree : Her Glory and Fame through the Nation does ring , She having the Honour to wait on the King . Stout Roger he told his dear Mother one night , That Man that should Wed her the King will requite , In token of Love , for that Royal Feast , And make him Duke , Lord , or Squire at least . Her Glory and Fame through the Nation do's ring , She having the Honour to wait on the King . In troth , quoth the Mother , I'd have thee to go , And see if she'll have a poor Plowman , or no : And then if King William should make thee a Lord , Udzookers I'll count it a Royal Reward : Her Glory and Fame through the Nation do's ring , She having the honour to wait on the King . He dressed himself straight in his best Roast-meat Clothes , His Hat , Band , and likewise his Holiday Hose ; Yet Roger the Ploughman was never the near , She sent him away with a Flay in his Ear : Her Glory and Fame through the Nation shall ring , As having , etc At length came a Squire his Love to reveal , For he could no longer his Passion conceal ; He Woo'd and he Wedded this Lass out of Hand , And made her a Lady of houses and land : Her Glory and Fame through the Nation did ring , As having the Honour to wait on the King . The young Lads and Lasses that liv'd far and near , As soon as the happy good News they did hear , They came to the Wedding for Merriness sake , And the noble Squire great Feasting did make ; And her Fame through all the whole Nation does ring , As having the honour to wait on the King . Among all the Dainties which they did prepare A Dish of good Bacon and Eggs too was there , And valu'd above the Goose , Capon , or Duck , It being the Prologue of all this good luck : Her Glory and Fame through the Nation does ring , As having the Honour to wait on the King .
