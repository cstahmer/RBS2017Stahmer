The Lamenting LADY's Farewell to the WORLD , Who being in strange Exile , bewails her own Misery , complains upon Fortune and Destiny , describes the Manner of her Breeding , deplores the Loss of her Parents , wishing Peace and Happiness to England , which was her Native Country . And withal , resolved for Death , cheerfully commending her Soul to Heaven and her Body to the Earth ; quietly departed this Life , Anno 1650. To the Excellent Tune , called , O Hone , O Hone . The First Part. MOURNFUL Melpomene Assist my Quill , That I becomingly May make my Will : Guide thou my Hand to write , And Senses to indite , A Lady's last Good-Night . Oh! pity me . I that was Nobly Born , Hither am sent , Like to a Wretch forlorn , Here to lament , In this most strange Exile , Yet to remain a While , Till Heav'n be pleas'd to Smile And send for me . My FRIENDS cannot come nigh Me , in this Place ; Nor bear me Company : Such is my Case . Poor I ! am left alone , Few to regard my Moan ; All my Delights are gone : Heav'n ! succour me . Each Day with Cares and Fears I am perplexed ; My Drink is Brinish Tears , With Sorrow mix When Others soundly Sleep , I sadly Sob and Weep , Oppress'd with Dangers deep . LORD ! Comfort me . When England flourished , My PARENTS dear Tenderly nourished Me , many a Year : I was advanc'd on High , In Place of Dignity ; With Gold and Bravery They decked me . The Second Part. MY Garments dressed with Pearl Richly attir'd ; Never was English Girl So much admir'd : Old and Young , Great and Small , Waited upon my Call : I had the Love of all That did me see . But from my former State , I am call'd back , Through Destiny and Fate All goes to Wrack : Fortune did lately frown , And caught me by the Crown , So pull'd me Headlong down . Oh! woe is me . My FRIENDS dear , are decay'd , Who lov'd me best ; Never was harmless Maid So soar distres My FATHER he is dead , My MOTHER banished : All Joy is from me fled . Heav'n ! Comfort me . How well are they at Ease , And sweetly blessed , That may go When they please , And Where they list , To see their Parents kind , As Nature does them bind ? Such Joys I cannot find . Oh! woe is me . All earthly Joys are gone , I will , and must , Only in GOD alone Put all my Trust. O Blessed TRINITY , One GOD and PERSONS Three ! Release my Misery , And Comfort me . No Creature upon Earth Can ease my Grief , Until the Time that Death Yield me Relief . A Coffin and a Grave , Is that which I would have . Sweet CHRIST ! my Soul receive , And succour me . My Enemies that be Both Great and Small , Good LORD ! I pray to Thee , Forgive them all . May England flourish brave , When I am laid in Grave . So thus I take my Leave ; CHRIST sends for me . I have , in Heav'n above , A Place prepar'd ; Never shall I remove Thence afterwards . Go toll my Passing-Bell , While Angels ring the Knell : Thou vain World , now Farewell ! CHRIST sends for me . When she these Words had said , With cheerful Heart , The Noble-minded Maid Then did depart . No Doubt her Soul's at Rest , With Them whom GOD hath bles The last Words she expressed Prove That to be .
