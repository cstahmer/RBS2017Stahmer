A most Excellent Song of the Love of Young Palmus and fair Sheldra . To the Tune of , Shackley-hey . Y Oung Palmus was a Ferryman , whom Sheldra fair did love , At Shackley where her Sheep did graze , she there his thoughts did prove : But he unkindly stole away , And left his Love at S hackley-hey , fa la , fall la la la , So loud at Shackley she did cry , The words resounded at Shackley heigh , fa la , fall la la la . But all in vain she did complain , for nothing did him move , Till wind did turn him back again , and brought him to his Love When she saw him thus turned by fate , She turned her love to mortal hate . fa la , etc Then weeping to himself did say , I [ ' ] le live with thee at Shackley-hey , fa la , etc No no quoth she I thee deny , my Love thou once did scorn , And to my prayers would not hear , but left me here forlorn : But now being turned by fate of wind , Thou thinkest to win me to thy mind , fa la , etc Go , go , farewell I thee deny , Thou shalt not live at Shackley-hey , fa la , etc If thou dost my Love disdain , because I live on Seas , Or that I am a Ferryman my S heldra does displease : I will no more in that estate Be subject unto wind and fate , fa la , etc But quite forsake both Oars and Sea , To live with thee at Shackley-hey , fa la , etc My S heldras Bed shall be my Boat , her arms shall be my Oars , Where Love instead of storms shall float , on pleasant downs and shores : Her sweet breath my pleasant gale , Through tides of Love to guide my sail , fa la , etc Her Love my praise , she is my joy , To live with me at Shackley-hey , fa la , etc No Titan shall with me compare , so fortunate to prove , Fair Venus never was his peer , i'll bear the Queen of Love : The working water never fear , For Cupids self our Barge shall steer ; fa la , etc And to the Shore I still will cry , My S heldra's come to S hackley heigh , fa la , etc To Strow the Boat for thy avail , i'll rob the flowery shores , And while thou guidest the Silken Sail i'll Row with Golden Oars . And as upon the Seas we Float , fa la , etc And to the Shore I still will cry , My S heldra comes to shackley-hey , fa la , etc And have a story painted there , whereon there may be seen How S opho loved a Ferryman , being a learned Queen : In Golden Letters shall be writ How well in Love himself he quit , fa la , etc Then all the Lasses still shall say , With Palmus we'll to shackley-hey , fa la , etc And walking easily to the Strand , we'll angle in the Brook , And Fish with the White Lily wand thou knowest no other hook : To which the Fish shall soon be brought , And strive which shall be caught , fa la , etc A thousand pleasures we shall try , As we walk on to shackley-hey , fa la , etc And if we be oppressed with heat , in the midtime of the day , Under the Willows tall and great , shall be our quiet Bay : Where I will make thee Fans of bows From Phebus beams to shade thy Brows , fa la , etc And cause them at the Ferry cry , My sheldra comes to shackley-hey , fa la , etc A troop of dainty neighbouring Girls shall dance along the Strand , Upon the Gravel all of pearls , to wait when thou shalt Land : And cast themselves upon the ground , While thou with garland shall be crowned fa la , etc And Shepherd's all with joy shall say See sheldra comes to shackley-hey , fa la , etc A Lthough I did my self absent , 'twas but to try thy mind .
