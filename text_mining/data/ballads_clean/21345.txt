The Willow-Green : OR , The Distressed Lovers Complaint , because that his Love Compassion does want . The like to this Ditty was never read , nor seen , For he weareth a Garland all of Willow-Green . To a new Tune , called , The willow green , Sung by Musicians , and in the Theator . Y Oungmen & amp ; maids that live in love , come listen to this harmless ditty , And let fancy your hearts move , for to take of me some pity : For unto you I will declare , the strangest thing that ever was seen , Sad happiness to prove my share , now to wear the willow green . I'm almost eighteen years of age , and so deep am fallen in Love ; Nothing can Cupid's fire asuage , except my Dear doe constant prove : Oft did I make suit unto her , in place where we both have been , with sighs and tears I then did woe her though now I wear the willow green . Many gifts I did her proffer . if she would grant love to me , But she refused my kind offer , I could not esteemed be . Behold how my body is wasted , little thought I these days to have seen , So deep of loves cup oft have tasted , and now to wear the willow green . Search the stories of old ages , from Adam to this present time , That have filled volumes and pages , no men case is like to mine ; For my Love does prove hard hearted , harder then Adamant I ween And cunningly from me is parted , which makes me wear the willow green . The Second Part , to the same Tune . C Ome all that bears good will unto me do so much as tell me how , This green garland does become me , which I am forced to wear now : Because obdurate she does prove , whose beauty might become a Queen , And most unfaithful is in Love , which makes me wear the willow green . My love sleeps on another man's pillow , were it but for and hour or two , Then i'de leave off this mournful willow then Love see what you can do : Was ever man more kind in trial , to a Lass then I have been , But she to me does prove disloyal , and makes me wear the willow green . Harder hap had never no man , from the Creation until now : To love a cruel unkind woman , which will to me no love allow . Both day and night I am tormented , no rest long time that I have seen , My torture cannot be prevented , but I must wear the willow green . And some friends have lately told me , which my sad fates much deplore I look like death when they behold me , though I was jovial heretofore : Oh that my lovesick suit was granted , by her that I most esteem , I should enjoy what I [ ' ] we long wanted and leave off this willow green . My dearest when I do behold thee , as thou passest along the street , In mine arms I wish to enfold thee , with kisses I would thee greet : O that thy heart was not obdurate , but in Church we might be seen , And be wedded by and honest Curate , then i'de cast off this willow green . TO how art a Damosel full of beauty , rare perfections dwells in thee , Cupid reports it is my duty , to wait with patient constancy : Many brave Damsels have I viewed , and Lasses rare where I have been , But for thy love I have greatly rued , till death i'll wear the willow green . Fairest of fairest I thee implore , on thy slave to take some pity : TO how art the Goddess that I adore , I pray thee read my mournful ditty For yet ever many days be spent , with thine own eyes it will be seen , When to the grave thou hast me sent , i'll die wearing the willow green . I hope and answer to receive , ever it be long assuredly , All happiness I thee bequeathe , and I will Love thee till I die : TO hus I remain the faithfullest Lover , that ever to this day was seen , worser [ i ] rect thine when thou hast read this over to him that wears the willow green .
