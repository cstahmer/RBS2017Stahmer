THE Valorous Acts performed at Gaunt , By the Brave Bonny Lass Marry Ambree , Who in Revenge of her Love's Death , did play her part most gallantly . To the of , The Blind Beggar , etc WHen Captain Courageous , whom Death could not daunt , Had roundly besieged the City of Gaunt , And manly they marched by two and by three , But the foremost in Battle was Mary Ambree . Thus being inforced to fight with her Foes , On each side they seemed most fiercely to close ; Each one sought for Honour in every degree , But none so much wone it as Marry Ambree .
