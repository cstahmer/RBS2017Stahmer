A pleasant new Dialogue : OR , The discourse between the Servingman and the Husbandman . The lofty pride must bated be , And praise must go in right degree . To the tune of , I have for all good wives a Song . AS I went through the meadows green , that are most lovely to be seen , I herd two men in great discourse oh [ f ] many things better or worse : The one a Servingman , and he stood much upon his bravery : The other was a Husbandman , which no man speak against him can . The Serving-mans speech . I am a Servingman that's fine , and feed on dainties , and drink wine , I am for Ladies company , who can have pleasures more than I ? I have the love of Maidens fair , that are their Parents only heir , Although they go in garments gay , with me they'l yield to sport and play . The Ploughman . Though you in garments go most brave , yet you must yield to what I crave , No servingman shall make me yield , I'll show the cause whereon I built . A Servingman cannot come nigh to that which I will verify : A young Servingman may compare to be and old beggar men heir . The Servingman . I wait on Ladies , Lords , and Knights , where pleasure flows with much delights , My time I spend with Venus Nymphs , whose features rare desire attempts . We Servingmen have pleasure at will : and Ploughman they have labour still , Then how can they with us compare , seeing we have pleasure , and they have care ? The Ploughman . Though you in pleasure do exceed , who is it that does serve your need ? You might go pine and starve with want , then at a Ploughman do not tant . We till the ground which brings increase , and all would lack if we should cease . Such bragging Jacks might do full ill , then to a Ploughman yield thee skill . The Servingman . Our parell many times is silk , our shirts as white as any milk , Our fare is of the very best , and that which is most neatly dressed . And often when we sup or dine , we taste a dainty cup of wine : Our Master's Cellars yield good beer , and in his Hall we find good cheer . The Ploughman . 'Tis true : there many goes in silk , and have their linen white as milk , And yet perhaps not worth a groat , but much like you , will lie and prate : The Proverb of a Servingman , as always I do understand , In prime of years hee'l roar and swagger , and being grown old he turns a beggar . The Servingman . Why should a Ploughman me deface , and urge me with such foul disgrace ? I dare to challenge you sir fool , to meet me at the Fencing-school : I will not so outbraved be , nor rank with such base pedigree , I am a man of courage bold , by Ploughman I'll not be control'd , The second part . To the same Tune . The Ploughman . INdeed you are of perfect mettle , your nose shines like a copper kettle , This true you are of courage bold , the pipe and pot you will uphold , You hold it rare to drink and smoke , all this is true which I have spoke : But 'tis a Husbandman's delight , to work all day and sleep all night . The Servingman . We have no labour toil and care , we Servingmen no drudges are , Our care is for the chiefest pleasure which seems to us a daily treasure : My Ladies Waiting maid most fine , with us both often sup and dine , Sometime a courtesy we crave , a kiss or so , and this we have . The Ploughman . If you the Proverb truly mark , Joane is as good as my Lady in' that dark , A Country Lass in russet grey , with her I love to sport and play : Oh she will dance and sweetly sing , much like the Nightingale in Spring , She's fresh and fair , and firm and found . in her much pleasure may be found . The Servingman . Well Countryman my mind is brave , I will not yield to what you crave : No Ploughman ere shall make me yield , I will not so much be compelled : My youthful days yields me much joys , my nights I pass with merry toys : My time is pleasure and delight , which I do spend with Ladies bright . The Ploughman . O hold thy peace , thy found delight does pass away like day or night . Thy aged head appearing grey , then does thy pleasure soon decay , Then from thy service must thou pack , and all things quickly wilt thou lack : Then warning take ere it be long , and learn to work while thou art young The Serving man . Why should I labour , toil , or care , since I am fed with dainty fare ? My Gelding I have for to ride , my cloak my good sword by my side , My boots and spurs shining like gold , like those whose names are high enrolled : What pleasure more can any crave , then such content as I now have ? The Ploughman . This true indeed , thy pleasure's great , and I have what I get by sweat , My labour gives my heart content , and I do live in merriment . He that true labour takes in hand , does far surpass the Servingman , He passes some with house and lands , when that decays , he cries , Help hands . The Servingman . Thy reasons I have understood , and what thou speak'st is very good . I would I were a Plough man now , and labour could at Cart and Plough , Then would I work and till the land , and never more be Servingman , For what they have is truly god , they are contented with their lot . Thus to conclude and make and end , let none with Husbandmen contend : You see here yields a lofty mind , and to good counsel is inclin'd . Thus will we all like lovers gree , the painful man shall pressed be , For by the labour of the hand , we do receive fruits from the land . Printed at London for F. Coules dwelling in the Old Baily .

AS I went through the meadows green , that are most lovely to be seen , I herd two men in great discourse oh [ f ] many things better or worse : The one a Servingman , and he stood much upon his bravery : The other was a Husbandman , which no man speak against him can . The Serving-mans speech . I am a Servingman that's fine , and feed on dainties , and drink wine , I am for Ladies company , who can have pleasures more than I ? I have the love of Maidens fair , that are their Parents only heir , Although they go in garments gay , with me they'l yield to sport and play . The Ploughman . Though you in garments go most brave , yet you must yield to what I crave , No servingman shall make me yield , I'll show the cause whereon I built . A Servingman cannot come nigh to that which I will verify : A young Servingman may compare to be and old beggar men heir . The Servingman . I wait on Ladies , Lords , and Knights , where pleasure flows with much delights , My time I spend with Venus Nymphs , whose features rare desire attempts . We Servingmen have pleasure at will : and Ploughman they have labour still , Then how can they with us compare , seeing we have pleasure , and they have care ? The Ploughman . Though you in pleasure do exceed , who is it that does serve your need ? You might go pine and starve with want , then at a Ploughman do not tant . We till the ground which brings increase , and all would lack if we should cease . Such bragging Jacks might do full ill , then to a Ploughman yield thee skill . The Servingman . Our parell many times is silk , our shirts as white as any milk , Our fare is of the very best , and that which is most neatly dressed . And often when we sup or dine , we taste a dainty cup of wine : Our Master's Cellars yield good beer , and in his Hall we find good cheer . The Ploughman . 'Tis true : there many goes in silk , and have their linen white as milk , And yet perhaps not worth a groat , but much like you , will lie and prate : The Proverb of a Servingman , as always I do understand , In prime of years hee'l roar and swagger , and being grown old he turns a beggar . The Servingman . Why should a Ploughman me deface , and urge me with such foul disgrace ? I dare to challenge you sir fool , to meet me at the Fencing-school : I will not so outbraved be , nor rank with such base pedigree , I am a man of courage bold , by Ploughman I'll not be control'd , The second part . To the same Tune . The Ploughman . INdeed you are of perfect mettle , your nose shines like a copper kettle , This true you are of courage bold , the pipe and pot you will uphold , You hold it rare to drink and smoke , all this is true which I have spoke : But 'tis a Husbandman's delight , to work all day and sleep all night . The Servingman . We have no labour toil and care , we Servingmen no drudges are , Our care is for the chiefest pleasure which seems to us a daily treasure : My Ladies Waiting maid most fine , with us both often sup and dine , Sometime a courtesy we crave , a kiss or so , and this we have . The Ploughman . If you the Proverb truly mark , Joane is as good as my Lady in' that dark , A Country Lass in russet grey , with her I love to sport and play : Oh she will dance and sweetly sing , much like the Nightingale in Spring , She's fresh and fair , and firm and found . in her much pleasure may be found . The Servingman . Well Countryman my mind is brave , I will not yield to what you crave : No Ploughman ere shall make me yield , I will not so much be compelled : My youthful days yields me much joys , my nights I pass with merry toys : My time is pleasure and delight , which I do spend with Ladies bright . The Ploughman . O hold thy peace , thy found delight does pass away like day or night . Thy aged head appearing grey , then does thy pleasure soon decay , Then from thy service must thou pack , and all things quickly wilt thou lack : Then warning take ere it be long , and learn to work while thou art young The Serving man . Why should I labour , toil , or care , since I am fed with dainty fare ? My Gelding I have for to ride , my cloak my good sword by my side , My boots and spurs shining like gold , like those whose names are high enrolled : What pleasure more can any crave , then such content as I now have ? The Ploughman . This true indeed , thy pleasure's great , and I have what I get by sweat , My labour gives my heart content , and I do live in merriment . He that true labour takes in hand , does far surpass the Servingman , He passes some with house and lands , when that decays , he cries , Help hands . The Servingman . Thy reasons I have understood , and what thou speak'st is very good . I would I were a Plough man now , and labour could at Cart and Plough , Then would I work and till the land , and never more be Servingman , For what they have is truly god , they are contented with their lot . Thus to conclude and make and end , let none with Husbandmen contend : You see here yields a lofty mind , and to good counsel is inclin'd . Thus will we all like lovers gree , the painful man shall pressed be , For by the labour of the hand , we do receive fruits from the land . Printed at London for F. Coules dwelling in the Old Baily .
