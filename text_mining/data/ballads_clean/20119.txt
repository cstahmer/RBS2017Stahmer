A merry new Jig . Or , the pleasant wooing betwixt Kit and Pegge . To the tune of Strawberry leaves make Maidens fair . M. W Ell met fair Maid , my chifest joy . W . Alas blind fool , deceived art thou . M. I prithee sweet Peg be not coy . W. I scorn to fancy such a Cow . M. Thy beauty sweet Peg , hath wone my heart . W. For shame leave off thy flattery . M. From thee I never mean to part . W. Good lack how thou canst cog and lie ! M. For Peggies love poor Kit will die . W. In faith what colour then shall it be ? M. In time my constant heart will try . W. Then pluck it out that I may see . M. My life I will spend to do thee good : W. Alas good sir , that shall not need . M. For thee I will not spare my blood . W. God send your Goslings well to speed . M. Yet feign would I be thy wedded mate . W. Alas good sir I am already sped . M. What luck had I to come so late ? W. Because thou broughtest a calf from bed . M. Oh pity me , sweet Peg I thee pray . W. So I have done long time God wot . M. Why dost thou then my love denay ? W. Because I see thou art a sot . Printed at London for H. Gosson . Now here does follow a pleasant new Song Between two young Lovers that lasted not long . OR , The second part , To the same tune . M. W High Ich have wealth and treasure store . W. And wit as small , as small may be . M. A chai [ n ] e of Gold I might have worn . W. A Coxcomb fitter had it been for thee . M. Thou lovest the Miller of the Glen . W. What if I do , what is that to thee ? M. I will bang the Millers love from him . And therefore weened and gang with me . W. Great boast small roast such brags will make : But if Tom Miller he were nigh . He would bang thee well for Peggies sake , And like a Puppy make thee cry . M. Yet kiss me now for my good will , And if my life thou meanest to save . W. To give a kiss , I think it best , To rid me from a prating knave . Be packing hence you Rustic clown . M. No haste but good I hope there be . W. Take heed left that I crack your crown For bussing Pegge so saucily . M. Nay in friendly sort now let us part , I pray thee sweet Love so let it be . W. Adue kind Kit with all my heart , I am glad I am rid of thy company . M. All you young men take heed by me , That unto women set your mind . See that your Lovers constant be , Lest you be served in like kind . Written by Valentine Hamdultun . A merry new Jig . Or , the pleasant wooing betwixt Kit and Pegge .
