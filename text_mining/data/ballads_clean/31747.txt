A most sweet song of and English Merchant born in Chichester . To and Excellent New Tune . A Rich Merchant Man , that was both grave and wise , Did kill a man of Embden Town , through quarrels that did rise Through quarrels that did rise the Germane being dead , And for that f [ a ] ct the Merchant man was judg'd to loose his head , A sweet thing is love , it rules both heart and mind , There is no comfort in this world to women that are kind . A Scaffold built was , within the Market place , And all the people far and near did thither flock apace : Did thither slock a pace , this doleful sighed to see , Who all in Velvet black as jet unto the place came he , A sweet thing , etc Bareheaded was he brought , his hands were bound before A Cambrick Ruff about his neck as white as milk he wore , His Stockings were of silk as fine as fine might be , Of person and of Countenance a proper man was he , A sweet thing , etc When he was mounted up upon the Scaffold high , All women said great pity 'twas so sweet a man should die ; The Merchant's of the Town from death to set him free Did proffer there 2. thousand pound but yet all would not be : A sweet thing , etc The Prisoner here upon began to speak his mind , Quoth he I have deserved death in conscience I do find , Yet [ s ] over against my will , this man I killed quoth he , As Christ does know which of my soul must only Saviour be , A sweet , etc With heart I do repent this most unhappy deed , And for his wife and children small my very heart does bleed , The deed is done and passed , my hope of life is vain , And yet the loss of this my life , to them is little gain , A sweet thing is love it rules both heart and mind , etc Unto the Widow poor , and to the babes therefore , I give a hundred pound a piece their comfort to restore , Desiring at their hands , no one request but this , They will speak well of Englishmen though I have done amiss , A sweet thing , etc This was no sooner spoke , but that to stint the strife Three goodly Maids did proffer him , for love to save his life : This is our Law quoth they , we may your death remove , So you in lieu of your good will will grant to us your love ; A sweet , etc Brave English man quoth one , 'tis I will beg thy life , Nay quoth the second it is I so I may be thy wife 'Tis I the third did say , nay quoth the fourth it is I So each one after other said , still waiting his reply , A sweet thing is love it Rules both heart and mind , There is no comfort in this world , to women that are kind . The second Part , to the same tune , FAir Maidens every one , I must confess and say , That each of you well worthy is to be a Lady gay : And I unworthy far the worst of you to have , Though you have proffered willingly my loathed life to save , A sweet thing , etc , Then take a thousand thanks , of me a dying man , But speak no more of love nor life , for why my life is gone , To Christ my soul I give , my body unto death , For none of you my heart can have , sith I must loose my breath , A sweet thing , etc Fair Maids lament no more , your County Law is such , It takes but hold upon my life my goods it cannot touch : Within one Chest I have , in gold a thousand pound , I give it equal to you all , for love that I have found , A sweet thing , etc And now dear friends farewell , sweet England now adieu , And Chichester where I was born , where first this breath I drew , And now thou man of death , unto thy weapon stand : Ah nay another Damsel said , sweet Headsman hold thy hand , A sweet thing , etc Now hear a Maidens plaint brave English-man quoth she And grant me love for love again , that craves but love of thee , I woo and sue for love that have been woo'd ere this Then grant me love , & therewithal she proffered him a kiss , A sweet thing , etc And die within thy arms , If thou wilt die quoth she , Yea live or die sweet English-man , I'll live and die with thee : But can it be quoth he , that thou dost love me so , 'Tis not by long acquaintance sir , whereby true love does grow , A sweet thing , etc Then beg my life quoth he , and I will be thine own , If I should seek the world for love more love cannot be shown , The people at that word did give a joyful cry , And said gre [ a ] tO pity it had been , so sweet a man should die . A sweet thing , etc I go my Love she said , I run , I fly for thee , And gentle Headsman spare a while my Lovers head for me . Unto the Duke she went , who did her grief remove , And with a hundred Maidens more , she went to fetch her Love , A sweet thing , etc With Music sounding sweet , the foremost of that train . This gallant Maiden like a Bride did fetch him back again , Yea hand in hand they went unto the Church that day , And they were married presently , in sumptuous rich array : A sweet thing , etc To England came he then with this his Lovely Bride , A fairer woman never lay by any Merchant's side , Where I must leave them now , in pleasure and delight , But of their names and dwelling place I must not here recite , A sweet thing is love , etc Printed for F. Coals , TO . Vere , and W. Gilbertson . A most sweet song of and English Merchant born in Chichester . To and Excellent New Tune .
