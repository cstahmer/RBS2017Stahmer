THE MERRY BAG-PIPES : The Pleasant Pastime betwixt a Jolly Shepherd and a Country Damsel , on a Mid-Summers-Day in the Morning . To the Tune of , March Boys , etc Licensud according to Order . A Shepherd sat him under a Thorn , he pull'd out his Pipe and began for to play , It was on a Mid-Summers-day in the morn , for honour of that Holiday : A Ditty he did Chant along , goes to the Tune of Cater-Bordee , And this was the burden of his Song , ' if thou wilt Pipe Lad , I'll Dane to thee , To thee , to thee , derry , derry , to thee , etc And while this Harmony he did make , a Country Damsel from the Town , A Basket on her Arm she had , a gathering Rushes on the Down : Her Bongrace was of wended Straw , from the Sun's hight Beams her face is free And thus she began when she him saw , if thou wilt Pipe Lad , I'll Dance to thee , etc Then he pull'd out his Pipe and began to found , while tempting on her Back she lay , But when his quivering note she found , how sweetly then this Lass could play : She stop'd all jumps and she reveal'd , she kept all time with harmony , And looking on him , sighing-said , if thou wilt Pipe Lad , I'll dance to thee , To thee , to thee , derry , derry , to thee , etc She never so much as blushed at all , the Music was so charming sweet , But e'er and anon to him she'd call , and bid him be active , turn and me As thou art a bouny Shepherd's Swain , I am a Lass am come to woo thee . To play me another double strain , and doubt not but I will Dance to thee , To thee , to thee , derry , derry , to thee , etc Altho' I am but a silly Maid , who ne'r was brought up at Dancing-School , But yet to the Jig that thou hast played , you find that I can keep time and rule : Now see that you keep your stops aright , for Shepherd I am resolv'd to view thee , Now play me the Damsel's chief Delight , and never doubt but I'll Dance to thee , To thee , to thee , derry , derry , to thee , etc The Shepherd again did tune his Pipe , and played her a Lesson loud and shrill , The Damsel his face did often wipe , with many a thank for his good will : And said I was ne'r so pleas'd before , and this is the first time that I knew thee , Come play me this very Jig once more , and never doubt but I'll Dance to thee , To tO [ h ] ee , to thee , derry , derry , uo thee , etc The Shepherd he said , as I am a Man , I have kept playing from Morning till Noon , Thou know'st I can do no more then I can , my Pipe is clearly out of Tune : To ruin a Shepherd I'll not seek , said she , for why should I undo thee , I can come again to the Down next week , and thou shalt Pipe and I'll dance to thee , To thee , to thee , derry , derry , to thee .
