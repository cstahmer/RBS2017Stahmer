To the King's Most Excellent Majesty . The humble Address of the Company of his Majesty's Ship ORFORD . MOST Gracious Sovereign Lord , may't please To accept the Homage of the SEAS , NEPTUNE who , under You , commands , Craves Leave to come , and kiss your Hands ; And we , Your Servants , Sons to Him , Give you Three Cheers from Stern to Stem , And pray , while we can splice a Rope , You'll live , the Anchor of our Hope . We mourn Your Royal Father dead , But Joy takes Place , that You succeed . Your Royal Conso [ r ] tO , next , we hail ; May She long ride in gentle Gale ! And may Your Offspring never fail ! Receive these Tributes as they run , Rough as the Elements we're on , For they're sincere , tho' not for Show , Nor do they from mean Custom flow , But from the Sense of what we owe . Our Duty does not bounce and boil , Our Pen's not dipped in Oxford Oil : We use no Tinsel Art to prove The Force and Ardour of our Love ; But come , like open-minded Folk , To tell You , We're your Hearts of Oak , And true -- as ever struck a Stroke . Nor shall we make our Paper found With Twenty Shillings in the Pound , As lying TOTNESS did before ; Tho' , if we cou'd , we wou'd give more : But we will give You what we can , And all stand by You , to a Man. Do Tempests rage , and By [ l ] lows toss ? Do Combinations make a Fuss ? We'll steer you , safe SIR , Thus , Boys , Thus. Speak , and we'll let your Thunder fly , And make the World dance BARNABY ; Bring all Invaders to the Geers , And cut of all your En'mies Ears ; Annex GIBRALTAR to Your Crown , And all Your Foreign Foes pull down ; Make huffing PHIL . and CHARLES obey Your Sceptre -- Keep us but in Pay . If the King asks , Who are you then ? We humbly answer Orford's Men : Who else dare ask , we answer bluff , We're ORFORD's Men ; and that's enough . To the King's Most Excellent Majesty .
