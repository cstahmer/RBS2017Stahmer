A pleasant new Song between a Seaman , and his Love . SHOWING , Though at the first in misery his time he spent He met his love at last , with Joy and sweet content , The Tune is Robin the Devil . WHen Sol could cast no light , but darkened over , And the dark vails of night the Sky does cover : A River running by where Ships were Sailing , A pretty Maid I spy'd , weeping and wailing . I stepped unto her , and said , sweetheart what grieves thee ? She quickly answer made , none can relieve me : My Dear by force , quoth she , in Wars does wander , Long absence makes me mourn , death is Commander . This seven long years and more he me affected , We parted on the Shore with hearts Contracted : He promised to turn again , if God life lent him , Which makes me sighs and mourn death hath prevent him . A Man then coming by , struck her amazed , Gave her a Token rare , on which she gazed : Is my Love come , quoth she , does he come near me ? But still the Man reply'd , be pleased to hear me . Your Love and I did fight under one Banner , Maintaining England's right , purchasing Honour : Till he receiv'd a blow , your hope's being buried , There he god his death's stroke , not to be Cured . Witness I can afford , no Man stood nearer , I saw him singled out , here stands the Bearer : Pressing among the throng , with Resolution ; His enemies so strong wrought his confusion . [ You ] r Dear receiv'd a stroke , and his brain broken , [ And ] these words then he spoke , carry this Token [ TO ] oh she whom I affect , and none more dearer , [ With ] shing her to respect , [ a ] and love the Bearer . [ Y ] our Dear in Grave does lie [ i ] n sumptuous manner , Where we will let him lie , in Beb of Honour : [ By ] his Right I am sent , [ the ] ur Love to crave it , [ By ] his last Testament , sweet shall I have it . Mad , like one in despair , fuming and fretting , She mourns and tears her hair , on her breast beating : M [ y ] Destiny I may ban , and all that hears me , Still crying to the Man , do not come near me . This for and answer take , what ever chances , I will mourn for his sake , and mine offences : Sad black shall be my weed , like to my fortune , [ H ] ence it does cut the thread , and my life shorten . Like to Phenelephe's joy , or the sad Queen of Troy , So she cry'd out this day , I am bereft of joy , And never man again , shall company bear me , Still crying with disdain , Do not come near me . Of all his former Love , he me assured , By all the Powers above , he me conjured : Of all [ l ] his promise made , when we last parted , To me he gave his Right , be not fainthearted . His Garments he threw off , which him disguised , That when she knew her Love , Lord how she praised : Betwixt sad joy and mirth rose such a passion , Which caus'd no great deni [ all ] unto the Question . Sweet heart come tell m [ e ] since our first meeting , How I did Act my part in counterfeiting ? Neat and brave , Sir , you might gain Ri [ ches ] If you could Do [ the same ] as well as Spe [ eches . ] Thrice happy be the W [ ind ] that hither broug [ ht you ] More happy be the [ ship ] on shore did land [ you ] Welcome to me , she [ said ] then fair Alexander , Or ever Hero was unto Leander . Like to Penelope to wanton Venus , My Love , kind heart , to thee shall be ingenious : Welcome to me , she said , then fair Amarillis , Or ever worthy Guy was to fair Phillis . When pastime it was done , and all things neatly , With joy they came along , siinging this Ditty ; Singing most jovely till they were weary , Thou hast been long away , welcome home Deary , By Cuthbert Birket .
