For Phillis fair that Lady bright , as ever man beheld with eye ; She gave me leave my self to try , the valiant Knights with shield and spear Ere that her love she would grant me , which made me venture far and near . The proud Sir Guy a barren bold , in deeds of arms the Doubtful Knight , That every day in England was , with sword and spear in field to figh And English-man I was by birth , in faith of Christ a Christian true ; The wicked Laws of Infidels , I sought by power to subdue .

Ezkeldred that Famous Knight , to death likewise I did pursue , And Almain King of Tyre also , most terrible too in fight to view . I went into the Sultans Host , being thither on ambassage sent , And brought away his head with me , I having slave him in his Tent.

[ A ] ll clad in grey in Pilgrim sort , my voyage from her I did take , [ U ] unto that blessed Holy Land , for Jesus Christ my Saviours sake : Where I Earl Jonas did redeem , and all his Sons , which were fifteen : Who with the cruel Sarazens , in Prison for long time had been . [ I ] slew the Giant Amarant in battle fiercely hand to hand , And Daughty Barknard killed I , the mighty Duke of that same Land : Then I to England came again , and here with Colbron fell I fought , And ugly Giant , which the Danes , had for their Champion thither brought . I overcame him in the field , and slew him dead right valiantly ; Where I the Land did then redeem from Danish tribute utterly : And afterwards I offered up the use of weapons solemnly ; At Winchester , whereas I fought in sighed of many far and nigh . In Windsor Forest I did slay , a Boar of passing might and strength ; The like in England never was , for hugeness both in breadth and length ; Some of his bones in Warwick yet , within the Castle there do lie ; One of his shield bones to this day , hangs in the City of Coventry . On Dunsmoreheath I also slew , a monstrous wild and cruel beast , Call'd the Don Cow of Duns-more-heath , which many people had oppress Some of her bones in Warwick yet , still for a monument do lie , Which unto every lookers view , as wondrous strange they may espy . Another Dragon in the Land , I also did in fight destroy , Which did both men and beasts oppress and all the Country soar annoy : And [ worser ] then to Warwick came again , like Pilgrim poor , and was not known , And there I liv'd a Hermit's life , a mile and more out of the town . Where with my hand I hew'd a house , out of a craggy rock of stone ; And lived like a Palmer poor , within that Cave my self alone : And daily came to beg my food of Phillis at my Castle Gate , Not known unto my loving Wife , who mourned daily for her mate . Till at the last I fell soar sick , yea sick so soar that I must die ; I sent to her a ring of gold , by which she knew me presently : Then she repairing to the Cave , before that I gave up the Ghost ; Her self clos'd up my dying eyes , my Phillis fair , whom I lov'd most .
