Certain approved Medicines for the Plague , both to pre - vent that contagion , and to expel it after it be taken ; as have been Approved in Anno 1625. as also in this present Visitation , 1665. A cheap Medicine to keep from Infection . TAke a pint of new Milk , and cut two cloves of Garlic very small , put it in the Milk , and drink it morning's fasting , and it pre - serves from infection . A Posset Drink to remove the Plague from the Heart . AND Ale Posset-Drink with Pimpernel seethed in it , till it tastes strong of it , drunk often , removes the Infection , though it hath god to the very Heart . And approved Remedy against the Plague . TAke a sprig of Rue , alias , herb of-grace , and shred it , and put it in a Fig or two , and eat it every morning fasting , it keeps the Body from Infection , and purifi - eth the blood . REader , whatever thou art , rich or poor , Rouse up thyself , for Death stands at the door ; If God says strike , he must , & will come in , For death we know is the reward of since . His very breath is so infectious grown , He poisons every one he breathes upon ; He is the Rich-mans terror , makes him fly , And bear away his bags , as loath to die . What shall the Poor doe that behind do stay ? Death makes them rich , by taking them away . But what shall Poor men do , that here do live , 'Tis surely fit the Rich should comfort give , And weekly Means unto them still afford : O such Rich men shall be rich in the Lord ! Death startles all , but m [ ? ] of since , Which sinful man long time [ e h ] ath lived in , Does make them fearful of [ tO ] hat punishment Due unto since , for time tha [ ? ] [ ? ] vil spent . O why was this not thoug [ ht ] on long ago ! When God expected our R [ ep ] entrance so ? Seventeen years since , a little [ e ] Plague God sent , He shook his Rod to move us to repen Not long before that time , a dearth of Corn Was sent to us to see if we would turn : And after that , there's none deny it can ; The Beasts did suffer for the since of man : Grass was so short and small , that it was told , Hay for four pound a Load was daily sold . These Judgements God hath sent even to cite us Unto Repentance , and from since to fright us . O stubborn England ! childish and unwise , So heavy laden with iniquities . Return , return , unto thy loving Father , Return I say with speed , so much the rather , Because his Son thy Saviour pleads thy cause , Though thou hast broken all his holy Laws : Say to thyself , My sins are cause of all Gods Judgements that upon this Land do fallen , And sin's the cause that each one does complain , They have too much , sometime to little rain : Say to thyself , this Plague may be removed , If I repent , as plainly may be proved By Niniveh , that City great and large , For God hath given unto his Angels Charge , To strike and to forbear as he sees fit ; If it be so , then learn thou so much wit , To use thy best endeavour to prevent A Plague , which thou mayest do if thou repent . Let all infected Houses be thy Text , And make this Use , that thine may be the next . The Read Cross still is us'd , as it hath been , To show they Christians are , that are within : And Lord have mercy on us , on the Door , Puts thee in mind , to pray for them therefore . The Watchman that attends the House of sorrow , He may attend upon thy House tomorrow . O where's the vows we to our God have made ! When death and sickness came with Axe & Spade , And hurl'd our Brothers up in heaps apace , Even forty thousand in a little space : The Plague among us is not yet removed , Because that since of us is still beloved . Each spectacle of Death and Funeral , Puts thee and I in mind , We must die all .
