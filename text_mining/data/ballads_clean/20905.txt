A New Copy of Verses , ENTITLED ENGLANDS GLORY ; OR , THE IRISH-MANS LAMENTATION . Tune of , Lay of your Pleading . With Allowance . I . LET every Irish Tory , Take warning by my story ; For now my Song it does belong To the Praise of Englands Glory . II And now both Teague and Talbot , For their Rebellion goes to pot , Now Schomberg is come they're all undone , What becomes of them I know not . III . For they sunk both Boats and Barges , With other needless Charges ; But Schomberg Great , has crossed their Fate , By Landing at Carrickfergus . IV. While now the Game's a Turning , And the Bog-Trotters all a Mourning ; With Courage high , our English cry ; They shall pay for Towns Burning . V. For our Army it Enlarges , It will prove in vain , they'll Charge us ; For they must yield , and lose the Field , As they did at Carrickfergus . VI . For we'll pull down all their Alters , And Burn their Virgins Psalters ; Hub , Bub , bub , Bow , what can they do , To Escape the Hempen-Halter . VII . The Trumpet Tantaro Raro , And Swore by Macknamaro , That back they bring James their King , With the Song of Lillibo Lero . VIII . They hear no Proclamations , Through Talbots false Persuasions ; Which now they Curse , with Empty Purse , There Coper Trash Commissions . IX . They Rew both Time and Season , Beyond all Gospel Reason , Against William is Right , thus for to Fight , Which proves no less than Treason . X. Thus are they struck with Fear , Seeing our brave Arms there , Crying out Oh hone , let us be gone , And the Devil go with Mounsier . XI . They Scamper out of Hand Sir , To see to save their Lands Sir , On William is side , if not denied , Where Schomberg bears Command Sir XII . Thus they must lose Possession , For it's King William is Nation , Which James is Crew , will ever Rew , With Grief and Lamentation . LONDON , Printed for J. W. in White Friars , 1689.
