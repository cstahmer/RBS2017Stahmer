Love and Gallantry : OR , A Noble Seaman's last adieu to his Mistress , at the time of his being unfortunately drowned in the Last Engagement with the Dutch . With her passionate answer thereunto . To the Tune of , Farewell my Calista . FArewel my Clar [ i ] nda my life and my soul , I am plung'd in the sea , & on surges must roll Severe is my Fate , yet the waves do not blame , Though they drown me they cannot extinguish my flame Through secret paths , to blessed regions above , I wander , yet still must remember my Love : When the charming Beauty's of Angels I see , How can I my dearest but think upon thee ? Sometime from those manions I hope to descend To whisper my Love in the ears of my friend ; To Court her pure soul on that delicate Theam , In the welcome delights of and amorous Dream , To fan the cool air on her face as she lies , And acknowledge my self still a slave to her eyes : Too gross is the Love and too drossy the fire , That vanquishes soon as the breath does expire , The deeds I have done I leave upon score , And am heartily sorry I made them no more ; For the best of all Princes I fought in whose cause Even Coward would die for to merit applause : May good success equal the right of his Arms , And providence ever protect him from harms . some generous thoughts in ons soul it must bring To love such a Mistiss , and serve such a King While thundering Cannons rung out my sad kneel I kept time with Broadsides their fury to quell : I fear'd not the Bullets and thought not surprise , Could equal those darts that were shot from thine eyes Alas , what more Terror in death could there be , When before I was kill'd by my absence from thee : Thus resolv'd I lay down on a watery Pillow , And was rocked to eternal sleep with a Billow . This far nobler methinks thus bravely to die , Courageously fighting a bold Enemy : Than that our life's Taper should dully blaze out , By Fever , Consumption , Scurvy , or Gou I hate all delays , and do welcome that death , That comes on a sudden and puffs out ones breath : Yet to sweeten my fallen kind fate did decree , I should not be wounded by any but thee . If the Waves to the shore my dead body shall bear , And thy fair Eyes come to Embalm't with a tear , If with some kind wishes the Corpse thou shalt view And acknowledge my love , and my services true : I then shall rejoice not repine at my fate , And Princes may envy my happier state , For who would not die if sure he cou'd be , But after his death to be loved by thee Her Answer . CAll not your Clarinda , your life , and your soul , she dies & turns statue to hear where you roll To bid her farewell , alas 'tis but vain , And remembering your love , but increases her pain : Fate cannot decree to commit such a wrong , Unless it intend too to take me along , Our death as our life , such a sympathy bears , You are drown'd in the Ocean , & I in my tears . In vain for thy safety , with vows , & with prayers , Have I interceded and bribed heavens ears , Sure Destiny takes a delight to oppress , The brave , and denyeth the worthy success , Yet shall not the envy of Fate undermine , The Glory attends me in having been thine : I never fear'd death should extinguish thy Love , for I know by my own that it endless would prove . The deeds thou hast done are recorded by Fame , Which so loudly does echo thy glorious name , that the wondering world this fam'd truth shall approve Thy Valour was equal'd by nought but thy Love : our merchant's by thee were relieved from their fears The Pirates did tremble , thou humbledst Algeirs , where poor Christian slaves shall thy memory bless Releas'd by thy conduct and freed from distress . In all the fierce wars with the Dutch we must own Thy courage as great and as gallantly shown , Full well to their cost when the enemy knew , and have cause to remember the blows of the Blue In brief thy exploits are so many and great , Thou only couldst die , for to make them complea O die ! how twould grieve me , that did I not know This comfort from fate , that my self can die too . Farewell loathsome life , for I only will stay , Once more to embrace these dear relics of clay : To seal his cold lips with a languishing kiss , And tell him I come to be his partner in Bliss , Then decently laid in his Grave from my eyes , A deluge of water shall presently rise : Whose high swelling Billows to Heaven being Hurl'd , Shall waft my soul over into a new world . Then meeting above in the seats of the blessed , Where lovers in peace may eternally rest , where wars are quite banished , & where they need fear No whispering tongue , nor evesdropping Ear , Where pleasures are grac'd with a permanent joy , And waters can't drown , nor can bullets destroy , There linked in each others kind arms will we fit , whi [ l ] st our fancies each moment new blisses beget Printed for Phillip Brooksby , in West-smith-field , Love and Gallantry : OR , A Noble Seaman's last adieu to his Mistress , at the time of his being unfortunately drowned in the Last Engagement with the Dutch .
