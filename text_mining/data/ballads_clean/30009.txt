A new Yorkshyre Song , Entitled : Yorke , Yorke , for my money : Of all the Cities that ever I see , For merry pastime and company , Except the City of London . AS I came thorough the Northcountrey , The fashions of the world to see , I sought for merry company , [ ] to go to the City of London : And when to the City of Yorke I came , I found good company in the same , As well disposed to every game , as if it had been at London . Yorke , Yorke [ for ] my money , Of all the Cities that ever I so , For merry pastime and company , Except the City of London . And in that City what saw I then : Knights , S [ queen ] ires , and Gentlemen , A shooting went for Matches ten , as if it had been at London . And they shot for twentie pounds a Bow , Beside great cheer they did bestow , I never saw a gallanter show , except I had been at London . Yorke , york , for my money , etc These Matches you shall understand , The Earl of Essex took in hand , Against the good Earl of Cumberlande , as if it had been at London . And agreed these matches all shall be , For pastime and good company , At the City of Yorke full merrily , as if it had been at London . Yorke , york , for my money , etc In Yorke , there dwells and Alderman , which Delights in shooting very much , I never herd of any such , in all the City of London . His name is Malthie , merry and wise , At any pastime you can devise , But in shooting all his pleasures lies , the like was never in London . Yorke , york , for my money , etc This Malthie , for the Cities sake , To shoot ( himself ) did undertake , At any good Match the Earls would make , as well as they do at London . And he brought to the field with him , One Speck , and Archer proper and trim , And Smith , that shoot about the pin , as if it had been at London . Yorke , york , etc Then came from Cumberland Archers three , Best Bowmen in the North country , I will tell you their names what they be , well known to the City of London . Wamsley , many a man does know , And Bolton , how he draws his Bow , And Ratcliffes shooting long ago , well known to the City of London . Yorke , york , etc And the Noble Earl of Essex came , To the field himself to see the same , Which shall be had for ever in fame , as soon as I come at London . For he showed himself so diligent there , To make a Mark and keep it fair : It is worthy memory to declare , through all the City of London . Yorke , Yorke , etc And then was shooting out of cry , The skantling at a handful nie , And yet the wind was very high , as it is sometime at London . They clapped the Clouts so on the rags , There was such betting and such brags : And galloping up and down with Nags , as if it had been at London . Yorke , york , etc And never and Archer gave regard , To half a Bow , nor half a yard , I never see Matches go more harden : about the City [ oh ] f London : For , fairer play was never played , Nor fairer lays was never laid , And a week together , they kept this trade , as if it had been at London . Yorke , york , etc The Mayor of Yorke , with his company , Were all in the fields , I warrant you , To see good rule kept orderly , as if it had been at London . Which was a dutiful sighed to see , The Mayor and Aldermen there to be , For the setting forth of Archery , as well as they do at London . Yorke , york , etc And there was neither fault nor fray , Nor any disorder any way : But every man did pitch and pay , as if it had been at London : As soon as every Match was done , Every man was paid that wone , And merrily up and [ dow ] ne did run , as if it had been at London . Yorke , york , etc And never a man that went abroad , But thought his m [ any ] well bestowed : And money laid oh [ n ] [ h ] eape and load , as if it had been at London . And Gentlemen there , so frank and free , As a Mint at Yorke again should be , Like shooting did I never see , except I had been at London . Yorke , york , etc At Yorke , were Ambassadors three , Of Russia , Lords of high degree , This shooting they desired to see : as if it had been at London : And one desired to draw a Bow , The force and strength thereof to know , And for his delight he drew it so , as seldom seen in London . Yorke , york , etc And they did marvel very much , There could be any Archer such , To shoot so far the Clout to touch , which is no news to London : And they might well consider than , And English shast will kill a man , As hath been proved where and when , and Chronicled since in London . Yorke , etc The Earl of Cumberlands Archers wone , Two Matches clear , ere all was done : And I made haste apace to run , to carry these news to London . And Wamsley did the upshot win , With both his shafts so near the pin , You could scant have put three fingers in , as if it had been at London . Yorke , etc I pass not for my money it cost , Though some I spent , and some I lost , I wanted neither sod nor roast , as if it had been at London . For there was plenty of everything , Red and fallow Dear for a King , I never saw so merry shooting , since first I came from London . Yorke , york , etc God save the City of Yorke therefore , That hath such noble friends in store , And such good Aldermen send them more , and the like good luck at London : For it is not little joy to see , When Lords and Aldermen so agree , With such according Commonalty , God send us the like at London . Yorke , york , etc God save the good Earl of Cumberlande , His praise in golden lines shall stand , That maintains Archery through the land , as well as they do at London . Whose noble mind so courteously , Acquaints himself with the Commonalty , To the glory of his Nobility , I will carry the praise to London . Yorke , york , etc And tell the good Earl of Essex thus , As he is now young and prosperous , To use such properties virtuous , deserves great praise in London : For , it is no little joy to see , When noble Youths so gracious be , To give their good wills to their Country , as well as they do at London . Yorke , york , etc Farewell good City of Yorke to thee , Tell Alderman Malthie this from me , In print shall this good shooting bee , as soon as I come at London . And many a Song will I bestow , On all the Musicians that I know , To sing the praises where they go , of the City of Yorke , in London . Yorke , york , etc God save our Queen , and keep our peace That our good shooting may increase : And praying to God , let us not cease , as well at Yorke , as at London . That all our Country round about , May have Archers good to hit the Clout , Which England cannot be without , no more then Yorke and London . Yorke , york , etc God grant that ( once ) her Majesty , Would come her City of Yorke to see , For the comfort great of that Country , as well as she does to London . Nothing shall thought to deer , To see her Highness Person there , With such obedient love and fear , as ever she had in London . Yorke , york , for my money , Of all the Cities that ever I see , For merry pastime and company , Except the City of London . From Yorke , by W.E. Imprinted at London by Richard Jones : dwelling near Holburne Bridge . 1584.

A new Yorkshyre Song , Entitled : Yorke , Yorke , for my money : Of all the Cities that ever I see , For merry pastime and company , Except the City of London . AS I came thorough the Northcountrey , The fashions of the world to see , I sought for merry company , [ ] to go to the City of London : And when to the City of Yorke I came , I found good company in the same , As well disposed to every game , as if it had been at London . Yorke , Yorke [ for ] my money , Of all the Cities that ever I so , For merry pastime and company , Except the City of London . And in that City what saw I then : Knights , S [ queen ] ires , and Gentlemen , A shooting went for Matches ten , as if it had been at London . And they shot for twentie pounds a Bow , Beside great cheer they did bestow , I never saw a gallanter show , except I had been at London . Yorke , york , for my money , etc These Matches you shall understand , The Earl of Essex took in hand , Against the good Earl of Cumberlande , as if it had been at London . And agreed these matches all shall be , For pastime and good company , At the City of Yorke full merrily , as if it had been at London . Yorke , york , for my money , etc In Yorke , there dwells and Alderman , which Delights in shooting very much , I never herd of any such , in all the City of London . His name is Malthie , merry and wise , At any pastime you can devise , But in shooting all his pleasures lies , the like was never in London . Yorke , york , for my money , etc This Malthie , for the Cities sake , To shoot ( himself ) did undertake , At any good Match the Earls would make , as well as they do at London . And he brought to the field with him , One Speck , and Archer proper and trim , And Smith , that shoot about the pin , as if it had been at London . Yorke , york , etc Then came from Cumberland Archers three , Best Bowmen in the North country , I will tell you their names what they be , well known to the City of London . Wamsley , many a man does know , And Bolton , how he draws his Bow , And Ratcliffes shooting long ago , well known to the City of London . Yorke , york , etc And the Noble Earl of Essex came , To the field himself to see the same , Which shall be had for ever in fame , as soon as I come at London . For he showed himself so diligent there , To make a Mark and keep it fair : It is worthy memory to declare , through all the City of London . Yorke , Yorke , etc And then was shooting out of cry , The skantling at a handful nie , And yet the wind was very high , as it is sometime at London . They clapped the Clouts so on the rags , There was such betting and such brags : And galloping up and down with Nags , as if it had been at London . Yorke , york , etc And never and Archer gave regard , To half a Bow , nor half a yard , I never see Matches go more harden : about the City [ oh ] f London : For , fairer play was never played , Nor fairer lays was never laid , And a week together , they kept this trade , as if it had been at London . Yorke , york , etc The Mayor of Yorke , with his company , Were all in the fields , I warrant you , To see good rule kept orderly , as if it had been at London . Which was a dutiful sighed to see , The Mayor and Aldermen there to be , For the setting forth of Archery , as well as they do at London . Yorke , york , etc And there was neither fault nor fray , Nor any disorder any way : But every man did pitch and pay , as if it had been at London : As soon as every Match was done , Every man was paid that wone , And merrily up and [ dow ] ne did run , as if it had been at London . Yorke , york , etc And never a man that went abroad , But thought his m [ any ] well bestowed : And money laid oh [ n ] [ h ] eape and load , as if it had been at London . And Gentlemen there , so frank and free , As a Mint at Yorke again should be , Like shooting did I never see , except I had been at London . Yorke , york , etc At Yorke , were Ambassadors three , Of Russia , Lords of high degree , This shooting they desired to see : as if it had been at London : And one desired to draw a Bow , The force and strength thereof to know , And for his delight he drew it so , as seldom seen in London . Yorke , york , etc And they did marvel very much , There could be any Archer such , To shoot so far the Clout to touch , which is no news to London : And they might well consider than , And English shast will kill a man , As hath been proved where and when , and Chronicled since in London .
