Doctor Do'goods directions , To cure many diseases both in body and mind , lately written and set forth for the good of infected persons . To the tune of The Golden age . IF any are infected , give audience a while , Such Physic I'll teach you , shall make you to smile , It is wholesome and toothsome , and free from all guile , Which shall breed good blood , and bad humours exile . Although it may seem most strange , Yet this is most true and strange . If any man be troubled with uncomely long hair , Which on his fools forehead unseemly does stare , I have a medicine will cure him , to prove it I dare , Let him take a Razor and shave his head bore , And he shall be cured most strange , Oh this is a wonderful change . If any be troubled with and idle drowsy head , Whose chiefest delight is to sleep in his bed , With glutting his stomach this folly first bred , Let him fallen to his work , and be slenderly fed , And he shall be cured most strange , Oh this is most true and strange . If any man be troubled with a very shallow brain , Whose giddy apprehension can no wisdom attain , If he will be eased of this kind of pain , Strong Beer and hight waters then let him refrain , And he shall be cured most strange , Oh this is most true and strange .

And he shall be cured most strange , Oh this is most true and strange . If any man be troubled with outrageous teeth , Which eat up his riches , and make him play the thief , If he will be cured of this kind of grief , Let him sow up his lips , and he shall find releese , And this is a cure most strange , Oh this is most true and strange . If a woman be troubled with a tattling tongue , Whose too much vain babbling her neighbours does wrong I judge for her mouth its something too long , Therefore she must cut short while she is young , And she shall be cured most strange , Oh this is most true and strange . If a man have light fingers that he cannot charm , Which will pick men's pockets , and do such like harm , He must be let blood , in a scarf bear his arm , And drink the herb Grace in a possit lycia warm , And he shall be cured most strange , Oh this is most true and strange . The second part . To the same tune . IF a man with false dealing hath infected his breast , Or hath no good motion in his bosom possessed , Two handful of honesty he must eat at the least , And hate all vain glory , and falsehood detest , And he shall be cured most strange , Oh this is most true and strange . If any maid be sick of the sullen disease , Or grown out of temper that none can her please , She must be kept fasting the space of three days , And no man speak to her whatsoever she says , And she shall be cured most strange , Oh this is most true and strange . If any man be troubled with a false hollow heart , To cure such a fellow exceeds my Art , But yet my good counsel to him I'll impart , Let him take heed he rides not to Tyburn in a Cart , For then heel be cured most strange , Oh this is most true and strange . If a maid be infected with the falling away , Which proceeds from a longing desire some say , If she will be preserved and kept from decay , She must get her a husband without all delay , And she shall be cured most strange , Oh this is most true and strange . If a man have and ach in his bones at any tide , That to do any labour he cannot abide , With the oil of old Holly anoint well his side , And he shall be cured , this thing hath been tried , And it is a cure most strange , Oh this is most true and strange . If a man have a conscience that does him torment , If it be for sin , then let him repent , He must be right sorry for the time he mispent , And drink brinish tears when his heart does relent , And he shall be cured most strange , Oh this is most true and strange . If any men knees are grown stiff and so soar , That he cannot kneel down to pray any more , His heart is right stony , it is fitting therefore He get grace and mercy heavens name to adore , And he shall be cured most strange , Oh this is most true and strange . If a man be troubled with exceeding light toes , Which will run to the Alehouse in spite of his nose , If he spend all his money his credit to loose , He shall in close prison be cast by his foes , And then heel be cured most strange , Oh this is most true and strange .
