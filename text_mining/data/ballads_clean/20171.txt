A Prophesy of the Judgement Day . Being lately found in Saint Denis Church in France , and wrapped in Lead in the form of and Heart . To the tune of the Ladies fallen .

[ ? ] ke upon the Latter day , [ ? ] raweth to and end : [ ? ] tO thou upon this world , [ ? ] eft thoughts depend , [ ? ] not always here to live , [ ? ] nke that thou must die : [ ? ] being come , you must away , [ ? ] ling of and eye . [ ? ] by Gods own promise made , [ ? ] ot long endure : [ ? ] he [ said ] , is truth it self : [ ? ] oath [ ? ] else , so sure . For he hath P [ ? ] [ ? ] tO he will , our time more [ ? ] [ ? ] ache : And that heel Cut [ ? ] [ ? ] ees , even for his Elects [ ? ] As by a Prophesy in France , the which was lately found : In Parchment writ , and wrapped in Led , most close unto the ground . Within a Churches wall , which then , was pulled down to mend : Which showed ear thirteene years were passed , the world should come to end . The first Prophesy for the year , 1620. The words were these , which then were found : within this sacred place , Great Wars shall in Italy , within this little space . Which is no doubt Gods handy work , to Plague them for their pride : Which does with foul Idolatry , his holy name deride . The Second Prophesy for the year 1622. There shall not be a shepherd left , to feed the silly Flock : Then let us pray that in our hearts , he Grafted a surer stock ; And that we may not be bereft , of Pastors , us to teach : But that among us he will send , good men his word to Preach . The third Prophesy for the year 1623. The wrath of God shall show it self , throughout the world so wide : Which he will pour upon us all , for our incessant Pride . Then let us pray with full consent , that he may hold his hand : And that he will not wreak his wrath , upon our sinful Land. The fourth Prophesy for the year 1624 [ . ] God shall be known but of a few , which is a grievous thing : That we so little should regard , our God , the heavenly King . Who sent his Son to save our Souls , from Sathan , Death , and Hell : And that we should in heavenly bliss , with him for ever dwell . The fifth Prophesy for the year 1625. A great man shall arise , they say , which is a thing concealed : And unto few but Godly men , the same shall be revealed . Then let us pray which little know , that we may ready be : For him the which in glory sits , from all eternite . The sixth Prophesy for the year 1626. The fourt part of the Earth shall burn , the Sun shall darkened be , The Moon shall pour forth streams of blood , which fearfully will see , Unto the Souls which ill have done : but joyful to the rest : The bad 'twill terryfie to death , and greatly joy the rest . The Second part of the Prophesy To the same tune . The seventh Prophesy for the year 1628. A N universal Earthquake shall upon this Globe remain : The earth shall seem to move and stir , so shall the Ocean's main : Then if his breath can shake the same , which is the God of might . How could he plague us if he pleased but with his force to smite . The eight Prophesy for the year 1629. The Infidels true God shall know , and Trinity profess : God grant which we that Christians are , may never do the less : If those which do not fear the Lord , shall truest Christians turn . Then we which know the living God , in Hels hight flame shall burn . The ninth Prophesy for the year 1630. The Rivers shall be dried up , one Shepherd shall remain , And but one Shepefold shall be left , God's glory to maintain . Which is the latter day of all : where but one God shall reign , Then let us labour day and night : his favour to obtain , Great God which sittest in heavenly Throne grant that we sinners may , Have place in thy eternal Court , where holy Saints do pray . Still holy , holy Lord of Lords and Spirit full of grace , God grant that in that Kingdom we , may have a resting place . FINIS .
