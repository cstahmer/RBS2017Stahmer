The Sorrowful Damsels Lamentation For Want of a Husband . This Maiden sure was in a Longing Temper , And Young men they are to blame that would venture , It is a pity any Damsel she Should Want the help of a Young man's Company . This Maidens Fortune proves so very Hard , That never a Young does her no more Regard : But Young men hereafter be sure to have a Care , They do not bring Young Maidens to Despair . To the Tune of , The Country Farmer . I am a poor maiden lives in great distress , I am sorely tormented now I do confess To see so many are married and I lie alone That I have so long tarred and still can get none I am ready to fret myself out of my wit To see so many have Husbands , and I a maid yet , Which makes me to fret & to grieve and to make moan To see so many get Husbands and I can get none . I shall be undone if some course be not taken I am so much troubled with lying alone To lie in my Bed and to toss as I do It will kill any maiden the truth it is so , I tumble , I pull and I hall and I tear , When I think of a Husband but I am never the near Which makes me to fret and to grieve & to make moan To see so , etc When I see a young woman to give a young child the Breast I am mightily vexed and sorely oppressed Because I can't have the Comfort of a man I am ready to go mad let me do what I can My maidenhead louds me so soar I do say , I am in great danger I shall go astray Which makes me to fret and to grieve and to make moan To see so , etc When I am a making the Beds o then I do swear I could wish that some pretty Young man I had there That would humour my Fancy to give me Content That I might be marry'd I am so fully bent For never poor maiden had more need of a Cure To lie with a Husband o that would be pure But still I do fret to grieve and make moan To see so many get Husbands and I can get none . There is now little pity in Youngmen I find That a maiden should prove them to be so unkind To see other maidens that now are Wed What Comfort they have when with Husbands they're Sped While I do lie knawing the sheets all the night To think of the Comfort , I'de have if I might Which makes me to fret to grieve and make moan To see so many get Husbands and I can get none . Of all maidens in London my Luck is the Worst That I cannot get marry'd , soar I am Crossed And so many Young men that in London there be And never a One do except now of me I think I was born in the Arse of the Moon That never a One will take me in my Bloom Which makes me to fret and to Cry I'm undone To see so , etc My Longing will kill me I greatly do fear If I be not marry'd before the next year Therefore if some Young man will take pity on me And to ease all my Grief and my great misery , Then I should be eas'd and clear out of Sorrow Tho' to have a Husband of my own that I need not to borrow But yet I do fret and grieve and make moan To see so , etc There was never no maiden so sorely oppressed For want of a Husband I take little Rest And yet there is no Young man that comes on this way That I can have bis favour with me for to stay I fear I'm be glad for to mourn all my Life , Neither Rich man nor Poor man will make his Wife Which makes me to fret and grieve and make moan To see so , etc And now I have told the best part of my mind I shall die a Maiden Young men are so unkind It do's Kill my heart that 'its Ready to brake When I see so many Young men to walk in the streets And never a One will take me to be Marry'd That I fear all the days of my Life I must tarry I have the worst luck now to lie all alone To see so many get Husbands and I can get none .
