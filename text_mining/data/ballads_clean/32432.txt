The Name without the Nature is a Gull , Be like our JESUS he was Merciful : His Love appears how much he did esteem us , He kill'd none , was killed to Redeem us : Being impt with Cherubin and Angels Wing , Wou'd he have killed a ( i ) Godfrey or a ( c ) King ?

That ( b ) killing Kings was the next way to Glory : ( r ) David , the next Successor was appointed , Durst not lay hands on ( s ) Saul , the Lords Anointed : But you , what in the World was never known , Have framed a New Gospel of your own . And being mounted on Ambitions Wings , Wou'd fly aloft to Heaven by ( b ) killing Kings : And had not BEDLOW's hand came to deliver , Our Noble Prince had fall'n asleep for ever . AND ANACROSTICK . What Blessed hand directed thee to pry Into the Jesuits subtle Policy ? Let Wisdom that did set thee in the Path , Limit our Foes , and Bind their Boundless Wrath. I wish that their Repentance truly may , Answer the Mischief of this fatal day . May they that unadvisedly did climb , Be truly sorrowful for their foul Crime , Erect their humble Minds to Heavenly things , Dash all their future hope's of killing Kings : Lend them a melting Heart fill'd full of Terror , Open their Eyes that they may see their Error . Wisdom that tames the raging of the Seas . End all our Difference in love and Peace .
