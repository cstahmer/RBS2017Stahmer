A most Excellent song of the love of young Palmus , and fair Sheldra . To the tune of , Shackley-hey . YOung Palmus was a Ferryman , whom Sheldra fair did Love , At Shackley where her sheep did graze , she there his thoughts did prove , But he unkindly stole away , And left his Love at Shackley-hey , fa la , fa la la la . So loud at Shackley did she cry , The words resound at Shackley-hey fa la , fa la la la . But all in vain she did complain , for nothing did him move ; Till wind did turn him back again , and brought him to his Love , When she saw him thus turn'd by fate , She turn'd her love to Mortal hate , fa la , etc Then weeping to himself did say , I'le Live with thee at Shackley-hey , fa la , etc No no quoth she , I thee deny , my Love thou once did scorn , And to my prayers wouldst not hear , but left me here forlorn . But now being turn'd by fate of wind , Thou thinkest to win me to thy Mind , fa la , etc Go , go , farewell I thee deny , Thou shalt not Live at Shackley-hey , fa la , etc If thou dost my love disdain because I Live on Seas : Or that I am a Ferryman , my Sheldra does displease , I will no more in that estate Be subject unto wind and fate , fa la , etc But quite forsake both Oars and sea And Live with thee at Shackley-hey , fa la , etc My Sheldra's bed shall be my boat , her arms shall be my Oars , Where Love instead of storms shall float , on pleasant Downs and shores , Her sweet breath my pleasant gale , Through tides of love to guide my sail , fa la , etc Her Love my praise , she is my joy , To Live with me at Shackley-hey , fa la , etc Nor Titan shall with me compare , so fortunate to prove , Fair Venus never was his Peer , i is bear the Queen of Love , The working water never-fear , For Cupids self our Barge shall steer , fa la , etc And to the shore I still will cry , My Sheldra's come to Shackley-hey , fa la , etc To strow the boat for thy avail , i'le rob the flowery shores , And while thou guid'st the silken sail , i'le row with golden Oars , And as upon the seas we float ; A thousand swans shall guide the boat ; fa la , etc And to the shore I still will cry , My Sheldra comes to shackley-hey , fa la , etc And have a story painted there , whereon there may be seen , How sopho loved a Ferryman , being a learned Queen , In golden Letters shall be writ , How well in Love himself he quit , fa la , etc Then all the Lasses still shall say With Palmus we'l to Shackley-hey , fa la , etc And walking easily to the Strand , we'l angle in the brook , And fish with the white Lily wand , thou knowest no other hook : To which the fish shall soon be brought , And strive which shall the first be caught , fa la , etc A thousand pleasures we will try , As we walk on to Shackley-hey , fa la , etc And if we be oppressed with heat , in the mid time of the day , Under the willows tall and great , shall be our quiet bay : Where I will make thee fans of bows , From Phoebus beams to shade thy brows , fa la , etc And cause them at the Ferry cry , My Sheldra comes to shackley-hey , fa la , etc A troop of dainty neighbouring girls , shall dance along the strand , Upon the gravel all of Pearls , to wait when thou shalt Land , And cast themselves upon the ground , While thou with Garland shalt be crown'd , fa la , etc And Shepherds all with joy shall [ l ] say , See sheldra comes to shackley-hey fa la , etc ALthough I did my self absent , 'twas but to try thy mind , But now thou mayest thyself absent , for being so unkind , For now thour't turn'd by wind and fate , Instead of love thou purchased hate , fa la , etc Therefore return thee to the sea , And bid farewell to Shackley-hey , fa la , etc Then all in vain she did complain , and no remorse could find , Young Palmus through his own disdain made fair Sheldra unkind : And she is from him fled and gone He laid him in his boat alone , fa la , etc And so betook him to the Sea , And bad farewell to Shackley-hey , fa la , etc Then from the happy sandy shore , into the floating waves , His Vessel fraught with brinish tears , into the Main he laves , But all in vain for why he still With weeping eyes his boat did fill , fa la , etc And launched himself into the sea , And bad farewell to Shackley-hey , fa la , etc Now farewell to my Sheldra fair whom I no more shall see ; I mean to led my Life at sea by thy inconstancy , Come Neptune come to thee I cry , With thee isle Live , with thee isle die , fa la , etc Then launched himself into the Sea , And bad farewell to Shackley-hey , fa la , etc But far from thence he had not gone ere Sheldra fair returned , Whose kind pity made me moan , such passion in her burned , But when she to that place arriv'd , She found the shore of him depriv'd fa la , etc And her dear Palmus now at sea , Had bid farewell to Shackley-hey , fa la , etc She then with bitter sighs complain'd , her grief did so abound , Oft grieved that she him disdain'd whom she so Loving found : But now alas it all in vain , For he was gone by her disdain , fa la , etc Leaving that place to her alone , Who now laments that he is gone , fa la , etc O wretched Sheldra then quoth she , [ c ] onfess what found disdain Hath wrath caused to fallen on thee , by this long suffering pain ; By thee alas so soon forgotten , Serve to thy loves strange hateful lot , fa la , etc And thus to lie and for him cry , Whom thou so fondly didst deny fa la etc Who once did truly Love I see will ever after hate ; As does too well appear by me in my forsaken state : Alas my scorn I mean to prove By only trial of thy Love , fa la . etc Now hapless me , for I do see He hath forsaken woeful me ; fa la , etc Thus all the while in roughest seas poor palmus boat was tossed ; But more in's mind this did disease because his Sheldra's los In midst of this he her forswears , He rend his coat and tere his hair , fa la , etc Threw hope away , for he alas Could be no more drown'd then he was , fa la , etc Even as his grief had swallowed him so did the greedy waves , About his boat and over the brim , each billow swiftly raves : There is no trust to swelling-powers That what it may it still devours ; fa la , etc And the breach the seas may see The boat felt more the rage then he , fa la , etc Thus wracked and scattered in the state , while he in quiet swam ; Through liquid paths to Thetis gate by soft degree went down ; Whom when the Nymph's beheld the girls Soon laid aside their sporting pearls , fa la , etc And up they heav'd him as a guest , Unlooked for now come to the feast , fa la , etc His case they pitied , but when they beheld his face right fain ;
