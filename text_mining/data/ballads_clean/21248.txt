Mars and Venus : OR , The Amorous Combatants . Mars strives for to give Venus Castle the rout , But she most valiantly did beatrice him out ; He lost the day for all he was three to one , He could not stay , his powder all was gone : And furthermore he god a soar mischance , To save some B alls he spoiled his best Lance ; She bids him come as often as he will , For all his force , she can resist him still . To a pleasant New Tune , or , Mars and Venus . A Broad of late as I was walking , in the Fields to take the air , Mars and Venus there was talking , in a pleasant shady Bower . I stepped close and sat down by them , They little thought I had been so nigh them , for to understand the matter , Whereunto they framed their talk , M ars vapoured thus as he did walk . Says M ars I am the God of Battle , and chief General of the Field ; [ I ] long to hear the Cannons rattle , I [ am ] armed with Lance , Spear & amp ; Shield I set forth with strong invasions , I conquer Castles , Towns , and Nations , there's no Champion dare resist me , I conquer all where ever I go , In spite of him that dare say no . But hark you M ars , methinks you vapour , ther's one Castle you never wone ; The Mistress of it never drew Rapier , and in it there's never a Gun : Yet I dare lay both marks & amp ; pounds oned that if ever you come within the bounds oned ever you come off , you'll loose men there ; And be forced for to retreat , And it's ten to one but you'll be beatrice . I N truth ( said Mars ) could I but spy it , I will venture there to fight ; That same Castle if ever I come nigh it , I will storm it by day or by night : Tell me therefore where it stands , And the names the which it commands , that same Castle which you treat on , And I will thank you for your pains , And be sure of this i'll make you amends . It's Coney-hall , near Navil-court , it's at the Fort of Belly-hill ; Near Blew-hole-lane you may resort to't or Bum-alley whither you will . Through Placket-entry there is the way to't In the low-country there you may go to't Venus she's the Mistress of it , And was never conquered by War , Although there be no fence but hair . Up to this Castle M ars drew his Army , and Bum-alley up did block ; He was clad in gallant Armour , she her own field filled with her smock , He laid such a close siege round about it , that there was none could come in or out it this called Venus to a parley , And to M ars away she went , Desiring for to know his intent .
