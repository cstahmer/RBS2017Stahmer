C : RB . I.262 ( 124 ) A Delectable new Ballad : Entitled Leader-haughs and Yarow , To its own proprr Tune . WHen Phoebus bright the Azure Sky , With Golden Rays enlighteneth ; These things Sublunar he espies , Herbs , Trees and Plants , he quick'neth , Among all those he makes his choice , and gladly goes he thorough , With radiant beams and silver streams through Leader-haughs and Yarow , When Aries the Day and Night , in equal length divides , Old Frosty Saturn takes the Flight ; no longer he abideth , Then Flora Queen with Mantle Green , casts off her deadly sorrow , And Vows to dwell with Ceres fell , in Leader-haughs and Yarow , Pan playing with his Oaten reed , with Shepherd's him attending , Does him resort their Flocks to feed , the Hills and Haughs commending , With Bottle , Bag and Staff with Knag , and all Singing good morrow , They swear no Field more pleasure yields , than Leader-haughs and Yarow , One House there stands on Leader side , surmounting my descriving , With ease rooms rate , and windows clear , like Dedalas contriving , Men passing by doe often say ; in South it hath no marrow , It stands as fair on Leader side , as New work does on Yarow , A Mile below who lists to ride , they'll hear the Mavis singing , Into St. Leonard's Banks she'l bide , sweet Birks her head over hinging , The Lintwithe loud , and Progue Proud . with tender Throats and Narrow ; Into St. Leonards Banks do sing , as sweetly as in Yarow , The Lapwing lilteth over the Lee , with Nimble wings she sporteth , But Vows she'l not come near the Tree , where Philomel resorteth , By break of day the Lark can say , I'll bid you all good morrow , I'll youel and yell for I may Dwell , in Leader-haughs and Yarow , Park Wanton walls and Wooden Clough . the East and Wester Mainses , The Forest of Lawders fair enough , the Corns are good in Blainslies , Where Oats are fine and Sold by kind , that if you search all thorough , Mearns ; Buchen , Mar , none better are , then Leader haughs and Yarow , In Burn Miln Bog and Whit shed shaws the fearful Hare she haunteth , Bridge haugh & Broad wood well she knaws to the Chapel wood frequenteth , Yet when she irks to Kieslie Birks , she runs and sighs for sorrow , That she should leave sweet Leader-haughs and cannot win to Yarow , What sweeter Music would you hear , than Hounds and Beigels crying , The Hare waits not but fles for fear , their hard pursuits defying , But yet her strength it fails at length , no beilding can she borrow , At Haggs Clockmas nor Sorlesfield , but longs to be at Yarow ; For Rackwood , Ringwood ; Rival , Aimer still thinking for to view her , Over Dubb and Dyke In Leader hough , she's run the fields all thorough , Yet ends her days in Leader-haugh , and bids fairvuell to Yarow , Then Eastlingtoun and Colding Knows , where Homes had once commanding , And Drygrange with the milk with Ewes , betwixt Tweed and Yarow standing , The Birds that flees through Read Path trees and Gladswood banks all thorough , May chant and sing sweet Leader-haughs , and the bonny banks of Yarow , But Burn cannot his Grief assuage : while that his Days endureth , To see the changes of this Age , which day and time procureth , For many a place stands in hard case , where Burns was blithe besorrow ; With Homes that dwell on Leader side and Soots that dwelled in Yarow . The Words of Burn the Violer . What shall my Violent silent be , or leave her wonted scriding , But choice some sadder Eulogy , no sports and minds deriding It must be fain with lower strain . then it was wont beforrow , To found the praise of Leader-haughs , and the bonny banks of Yarow , But Floods have overflown the banks , the greenish haughs disgracing , And Trees in wood grow thin in Ranks , about the Fields defacing , For Waters waxes , wood does wained , more if I could for sorrow , In rural Verse I could Rehearse , of Leader-haugh and Yarow . But sighs and Sobs o'rsets my breath , soar saltish Tears forth sending , All things Sublunar here on Earth , are subject to and ending , So must my Song though somewhat long , yet late at Even and Morrow , I'll sighs and sing sweet Leader haughs , and the bonny banks of Yarow .
