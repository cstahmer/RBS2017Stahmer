The Loyal English Man's WISH For the Preservation of The King and Queen . Licensed According to Order . LET MARY Live long , She's Virtuous and Witty , All Charmingly Pretty , Let MARY Live long , And Reign many Years . Now the Clouds is gone over , That Troubled us soar : Since the Sunshine appears , We shall be Delivered , We shall be Delivered From Fury and Fears . God bless the KING at Home , With Laurels to Crown him , Each Rebel may own him ; And may he Live long And Reign many Years ; Now the Conquest is plain , And Three Kingdoms Regained ; Let his Enemies fallen , While Caesar shall Flourish , While Caesar shall Flourish , In spite of they all . All Glorious and Gay , Let the KING Live for ever ; May he Languish never never : Like Flowers in May , His Actions smell sweet ; When the Wars are all done , And he safe in his Throne , Trophies lay at his Feet , With loud Acclamations , Vuhith loud Acclamations , His MAJESTY Greet . When for Flanders he goes , May the Enemy fear him , When ever they come near him ; May he Conquer his Foes As he did at the Boyn , May his Army march on With the Beatrice of the Drum , While Monsieur does Fly , The English shall Follow , The English shall Follow , And Fight till they Die . Heavens Prosper his Arms , Both at Home and Abroad May he always be Lord , And Guarded from harms By the Powers above ; May his Enemies all At his Feet present fallen , And their Loyalty prove , While our KING does Enjoy , While our KING does Enjoy Blessed MARY in Love .
