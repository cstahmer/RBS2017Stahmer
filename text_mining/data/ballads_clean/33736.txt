THE BRAVE ENGLISH SOULDIERS RESOLUTION . ROuse up my Muse , arise thou silly Girl Like a brave Amazon come crisp and curl Thy Locks , tune up thy voice , found and alarm , Alarm , alarm , stout hearts , brave Soldiers arm ; What shall the drunken Dutchmen brave it thus ; They scorn to stoop , they say , what stoop to us ! They swear they'l never do't ; the Belg'an Land Shall flourish still , and bear a free command Over her Natives all the narrow Seas : In them they'l sail , in them , if so they please , They'l fish and never ask King Charles his leave ; Nor shall he more his Rend therefore receive . Courage brave English hearts , what can you hear Such words stout hearts , what can you bear Such taunts , proud Belgians vaunting out their threats What they will do if crossed , what goodly feats Perform . Hold Dutchmen , hold , enough y' have spoke , We'l give no time to act , your words provoke Us to your cost you'l find : See , see , how fast we arm , Saint George for England is ; his Sword shall charm Your roving tongues to sing another Song ; It shall you teach 't shall not be very long Ere that of Amsterdam , the Lords for peace To Charles shall sue , using such words as these , We the Distressed States of Netherlands Humbly thee beg that thy Victorious bans Thou wilt withdraw , we smarted have full soar For our offence ; O let thy Sword no more Destroy we pray ; how easily revenge Thyself thou canst , thy Armies that do range Without control over the Belg'an soil , Which raze our Walls , which do our Cities spoil ; Do plainly show those that thy conqu'ring Sword Hath left unslain , let by thy gracious word Preserved be for th' future , we profess Ourselves thy liegemen true , we'l never transgress Against the peace which in thy Royalty Thou shalt us grant for Hostages let lie , What thou'lt require we proffer all our Land , Cities and Citadels at thy command . Till then our Fortune's all we do suspend , Forgetting all concerns , but this we bend Our utmost force for Royal Charles his sake , Nor of our dearest blood such care we'l take As of our Kings renown ; for him we'l fight , We'l watch , we'l ward , we'l march by day or night ; As cause requires , we'l serve by Sea or Land ; Nor grudge the toil since under thy command , Great Albemarle , Englands stout General , By whose great Deeds 'gainst foes Domestical ; All English souls have no small cause to sing , We now enjoy our lives , our laws , our King . Go on brave Duke , make Foreign foes confess Unto their cost they find thou art no less , Than Valours abstract , fortune's favourite , The most invincible Heroic wight . My Muse hath vow'd , so have the Virgins nine Engag'd by Oath a Panegerick line , To each thy famous deed Parnassus hill Shall found , resound with songs thy praise shall fill Heavens spacious Vaults , the Starry sphere Shall env'ous be when it thy fame shall hear .
