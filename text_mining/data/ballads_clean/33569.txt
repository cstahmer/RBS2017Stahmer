Dead and Alive : This DITTY out of Glocestershire was sent , To London , for to have it put in Prin Therefore draw near , and listen unto this , It does concern a Man that did Amiss ; And so to shun the Anger of his WIFE , He thought with Poison for to end his Life : But instead of Poison he drank Sack , For which his Wife did soundly pay's back . To the Tune of , Old Flesh , etc THhere was a shaving Royster , as I herd many tell , In Michal-Danes fair forest , in Glocestershire did dwell , Some call'd him William Wiseman , but in that they were to blame ; Some call'd him Leonard Lackwit , but that was not his name ; His name was Simple Simon , as it is well approv'd , And among his Friends and Kinsfolks , he dearly was belov'd : He capor'd and he vapour'd , and he liv'd a merry life , But yet good Man at all times , he could not rule his Wife . His Wife she was a Woman , that lov'd a cup of Sack , And she would tipple soundly behind her Husband's back : A bottle she had got that would hold two quarts or more , Well fill'd with wine , she hang'd it behind her chamber-door : And she told unto her Husband , that it was poison strong , And bade him not to touch it , for fear of doing wrong : If thou drink but one drop on't , ( quoth she ) 'twill end thy life ; Therefore in time take heed , and be ruled by thy Wife . This Simon's Wife had plenty of fatting hogs and pigs , With geese , ducks , hens , and turkeys , that laid great store of eggs : Both sheep , and such like cattle , fine ewes , and pretty lambs , Which up and down the forest did feed and suck their dams ; She put trust to her Husband to look unto them all , To keep them safe from danger ; now mark what did befall ; He did his best endeavour to shun all kind of strife , And yet through strange misfortune , he could not please his Wife . One morning she sent him to field to keep her sheep , And charg'd him to be watchful , and take heed he did not sleep : A piece of bred and butter she gave him in his hand , Whereby she made him promise to do as she did command . But see wha [ tO ] happened to him , when he came to the field , He fell asleep , while foxes three of his lambs had kill'd : This bred a great dissension and rais'd a world of strife , Till Simon for his fault had beg'd pardon of his Wife . Another day she sent him her ducks and geese to tend , And charg'd him on her blessing , he should no more offend : Her goslings and her chickens , with him she put in trust , Who took a stick and told them , so they were twenty jus But a woeful chance befell to poor Simon before night , For seven of his chickens were took prisoners by the kite : This vexed him , and it made him half weary of his life , For he knew not what answer to make unto his Wife . Next morning when that Simon was sent to milk the cow , Another strange mishap there was done to him by the sow , For while that he was driving the little pigs away , The sow came into the dairy-house , and swill'd up all the whey ; The cheese out of the cheesefat , she did both tear and haul , And so threw down the cream-pot , and made and end of all : Wherewith she burst her belly , and so she lost her life , And poor Simon knew not what answer to make unto his Wife . When's Wife came in the dairy-house , and saw what there was done , A strong and fierce encounter she presently begun ; She pull'd him by the ears , and she wrung him by the nose , And she kicked him on the belly , while the tears run down his hose , And she vow'd to be revenged before the morrow-day , For all the brood hf chickens , which the kite had carried away : Poor Simon stood amazed , being weary of his life , For he good Man was tired , with his unruly Wife . For when that he perceived his Wife in such a rage , Not knowing how , nor which way her fury to assuage : He cunningly god from her , and to the chamber went , Thinking himself to poison , for that was his intent ; So coming to the bottle , which I spoke of before , He thought it to be poison , which hung behind the door : Se vow'd to drink it all up , and end his wretched life , Rather than live in thraldom with such a cursed Wife . So opening of a window , which stood towards the South , He took the bottle of sack , and set it to his mouth : Now will I drink this poison , ( quoth he ) with all my heart ; So that the first draught he drunk on't , he swallowed near a quar The second time that he set the bottle to his snout , He never left off swigging till he had sucked all ou Which done , he fell down backward , like one bereft of life , Crying out , I now am poisoned by means of my cursed Wife . Quoth he , I feel the poison now run through every vein , It rumbles in my belly , and it tickles in my brain ; It wambles in my stomach , and it mollifies my heart , It pierces through my members , and yet I feel no smar Would all that have cursed Wives , example take hereby , For I die as sweet a death sure , as ever man did die : 'Tis better with such poison , to end a wretched life , Then to live and be tormented with such a wicked Wife . Now see what followed after , his Wife by chance did walk , And coming by the window , she herd her Simon talk : And thinking on her bottle , she up the stairs did run , And came into the chamber , to see what he had done ; When as she saw her Husband , lying drunk upon his back , And the bottle lying by him , but never a drop of sack : I am poyson'd , I am poyson'd , quoth he , long of my Wife , I hope I shall be at quiet , now I have lost my life . Pox take you , are you poyson'd , ( quoth she ) I now will strive , And do my best endeavour to make you run alive : With that a quill of powder , she blew up in his nose , Then like a Man turn'd antic , he presently arose : So down the stairs he run straight into the open street , With hooping and with hollowing , to all that he did me And with a loud voice cried out , I am raised from death to life , By virtue of a powder , that was given me by my Wife . Some Folks that did behold him , were in a grievous fear , For seeing of a Madman , they durst not him come near : He leapt and he skipped , thorough fair and thorough foul , While the People gaz'd upon him , like pyee upon and owl : His Wife she followed after , thorough thick , and thorough thin , And with a basting cudgel , she soundly bang'd his skin : And thus poor Simon cried out , I'm raised from death to life , By virtue of a powder that was given me by my Wife . At last a Friend of Simon's , which was to him some kin , By fair and kind persuasions , open'd door and let him in ; He sent for S'mon's Wife , and so made them both good friends , Who kindly kissed each other , and so all discord ends : The Neighbours all rejoiced , to see them thus agree , And like a loving couple , to bed they went with speed ; No doubt but Simple Simon , that night well pleas'd his Wife , Forever since that time , he hath liv'd a quiet life .
