The Gelding of the WORSER evil . OR , The prettiest Jest that ever was known , How the Bakers wife her skill hath shown , Then listen a while , and I the news will tell , Betwixt the Baker and the WORSER evil of Hell . To a dainty new Tune called , The Gelding of the Devil : Or , the Carded Players . A Pretty jest I will you tell , Of the gelding of the Devil of Hell ; There was a Baker of Mansfield Town , To Nottingham Market he was bound : And riding under the Willows clear , The Baker sung with a merry cheer ; And riding under the willows clear , The Baker sung with a merry cheer . The Bakers Horse was lusty and found , Well worth in Judgement full five pound ; His skin was smooth and his flesh was fat , His Master was well pleased at that : Which made him sing so merrily , As he was passing on the way ; Which made him sing , etc But as he road over the Hill , There met he with the Devil of Hell : Oh Baker , Baker , then cried he , How came thy horse so fat to be ? These be words the baker did say , B ecause his Stones be cut away ; these be the words , etc Thou shalt Geld me before thou dost go , Then ( quoth the Devil ) if it be so , First tie thy horse to yonder tree , And with thy Knife come and geld me : The baker had a Knife for the nonce , Wherewith to cut out the Devils stones . The Baker had a Knife for the nonce , Wherewith to cut out the Devils stones . The baker as it came to pass , In haste alighted from his horse , And the Devil on his back he lay , While the baker cut his stones away , Which put the Devil to great pain , And made him to cry out amain : Which put the Devil to great pain , And made him to cry out amain . O H quoth the Devil , beshrew thy heart , Thou dost not feel how I do smart ; And for the deed which thou hast done , I will revenged be again : And underneath this greenwood tree , Next Market-day I will geld thee : And underneath this greenwood tree , Next market-day I will geld thee . The Baker then but little said , But as his heart was soar afraid : He durst no longer then to stay , But he rod home another way ; And coming to his Wife did tell How he had gelded the Devil of Hell : And coming to his wife , etc Moreover to his wife he told , A tale that made her heart full cold ; How that the Devil did say , That he would geld him next Market-day : O , quoth the goodwife without doubt , I had rather both thy eyes were out : O , quoth the goodwife , etc For then all the People far and near , That knows thee , will both mock and jear ; And goodwives they will chide and brawl , And stoneless Gelding will thee call : Then hold content and be thou wise , And i'll some pretty trick devise ; then hold , etc I'll make the Devil change his Note , Give me thy Hat , thy Band and Coat ; Thy Hose and Doublet eke also , And I like to a man will go : I'll warrant thee next Market-day , To fright the Devil quite away : I'll warrant thee , etc When the Bakers wife she was so dressed , With all her bred upon her beast , To Nottingham Market that brave Town , To fell her bred both white and brown : And riding merrily over the Hill , O there she spied two Devils of Hell : And riding , etc A little Devil and another , As they were playing both together ; O , o , quoth the Devil then right sain , Here comes the baker riding amain : Now be thou well or be thou woe , I will geld thee before thou dost go , Now be thou , etc The bakers wife to the Devil did say , Sir I was gelded yesterday ; O , quoth the Devil I mean to see , And pulling her Coats above knee her , And so looking-upward from the ground , O , there he spied a terrible wound , And so looking , etc O , quoth the Devil , now I see , He was not cunning that gelded thee ; For when he cut out thy Stones , He should have closed up thy wounds . But if thou'lt stay some little space , I'll fetch some Salve to cure the place , But if thou'lt stay , etc He had not rid but little way , But up her belly crept a Flay , The little Devil seeing that , He up with his Paw and gave her a pat : Which made the good wife for to start , And with that she let go a Rousing Fart , which made thee , etc O , o , quoth the Devil , thy life is not long Thy breath it smells so horrible strong [ ; ] Therefore go thy way and make thy will , Thy wounds are passed all humane skill ; Be gone , be gone , make no delay , For here thou shalt no longer stay : Be gone , be gone , etc The goodwife with this news was glad , So she left the Devil almost mad ; And when she to her Husband came , With joyful heart she told the same , How she had cozened the Devil of Hell , Which pleased her Husband wondrous well How she had cozened the Devil of H ell , which pleased her husband wondrous well Printed for F , Coals , T. Vere , J. Wright , and J. Clark . The Gelding of the WORSER evil .
