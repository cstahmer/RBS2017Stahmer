A SONG , On the Constituting , and Revival , of The LODGE 296 , at Wakefield . WHAT Joy fills our Hearts --- what Transports we share ! When thus my dear Brothers ! we meet on the Square : Our Light now shines forth , where Darkness appear'd , For the LODGE is REVIV'D , that at WAKEFIELD was rear'd , Derry Down , etc With Hearts thus United --- Cemented by Love ! And Emblem of that happy Station above ! No Backbiting --- Malice --- nor Envy , have we , Our MOTTO is Silence --- Love --- Charity ! Derry Down , etc The Town's in and Uproar , it plainly is seen , FREE-MASONS ! cry they --- Pray what do they mean ? They're Eunuchs , one answer'd , I'm told by a Neighbour , That a FREE-MASON'S WIFE was never in Labour ! Derry Down , etc With a Hight Salamander , their Backsides , are sear'd --- That they're Haters of Women , I also have herd --- And that it is so , I most firmly believe , If their Secrets they keep , from the Daughters of Eve , Derry Down , etc They are Fools cry'd another , their Secrets to boast , For by Books that are publish'd , those Secrets are lost ; There's JACK KING --- AND BUZ --- And THREE PROPER KNOCKS , All the Myst'ry of Masons , most truly unlocks ! Derry Down , etc Then reply'd a Wiseacre , I know very well , No Secrets they have --- So none can they tell ! And these Books about MASONS , I strongly believe , Are only rank Nonsense the World to deceive , Derry Down , etc A LADY , then spoke --- As She Tea poured out , About these FREE-MASONS , what Din and a Rout ! If Secrets they have , I vow in one Night , We Women could bring , all their Secrets to light ! Derry Down , etc The Wife of a Mason , who herd all this Stuff , Cry'd , Peace , my Good Friends , you've shown Envy enough ! My Husband's a Mason --- And since he was made , He's a much Better-Man --- Both at Board --- And in Bed ! Derry Down , etc God bless ! these poor People ! Pray let them rail on --- And let us , dear Brothers , each strive , to mend One ! That by our Example ; the World may all see , To be good and virtuous , is FREE MASONRY ! Derry Down , etc Come Charge My dear Brothers --- Come fill the Glass high ! To the KING --- OUR GRAND MASTER --- and FREE-MASONRY ! To our Wives --- Bearns --- and Sweethearts , pray let it go round ! And may this our NEW LODGE --- with Blessings be crown'd ! Derry Down , etc Replenish , once more --- I've a Toast to propose , As the Hearts of Us Masons , with Gratitude glows ! To the GOOD LODGE of those Brother's so true ! Let's Drink with all Honours , to Masonry due ! Derry Down , etc A SONG , On the Constituting , and Revival , of The LODGE 296 , at Wakefield .
