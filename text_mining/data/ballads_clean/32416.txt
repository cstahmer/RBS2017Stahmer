H : 180182 A Hymn to be sung after Supper . FRom all such as purses cut , From a filthy dirty slut , From another Civil War , From Creatures that Committees are , From a base highminded Clown , From driving Sovereigns from their own From men with Treason tainted , From women which are painted , From all far fetched new fangles , From him that ever wrangles , From rotten cheese , and addle eggs , From broken shins , and gouty legs , From Bugbears , and broken glasses , From Romes Pardons , Bulls and Masses , From the breath that blows behind , From a holy brother's long wind , From private gain by public loss , From coming home by weeping-cross , From pulling down His Royal Grace , And setting Peasants in his place : From all these , I say again , Goodness deliver me . Amen . FINIS . H : 180182 A Hymn to be sung after Supper .
