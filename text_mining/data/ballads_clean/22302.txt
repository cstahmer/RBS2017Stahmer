King WILLIAM in Flanders , With bold and brave Commanders , Did face the French , While they lay Entrenched , Nought could be seen but Standards , They're Foot and Horse which fear not Would not Fight , Would not Fight , Some say 'twas Policy outright , But others say they dare not . The Winter Season coming , Did cause our KING's returning ; At Whitehall He's seen With our Gracious QUEEN , And His Subject's all Rejoicing , Let not the Nation now fear , Since Ireland Since Ireland Is all in brave King WILLIAM is hands , We valve not the Monsieur . There's Noble Men , and Valiant , I'm sure that will not fail oned , To draw the Sword At our brave KING's word , Against Lewis that French Tyrant . And I doubt not but next Campaign The English may The English may In the Heart of France both get the Day , And the King's health drink in Shampain . You Protestants Rejoice All , Our KING is now at Whitehall , What need we to care For those that despair For the Romish Faction's downfall , Let them never be thought on , Wh [ i ] lst we toss While we toss Bumpers off to King WILLIAM is Force , Which never will be forgotten . How happy is that Nation That's free from Popish Faction , It's seldom seen For a KING and a QUEEN Both of Protestant Profession : Here's a People Stou and Loyal , That's Content That's Content With our good KING and PAR L IAMENT God prosper long their way all .
