A True CHARACTER OF Sundry Trades & Callings OR , A New Ditty of innocent Mirth . This Song is New , and perfect true , there's none can this deny ; For I am known , Friend , to be one that scorns to tell a Lie . To the Tune of , Old Simon the KING . This may be Printed , R.P. NOw Gentlemen fit you all Merry , i'le sing you a Song of a Want , I'le make you as merry as may be , though Moneys begin to grow scan A Woman without e're a Tongue , she never can Scold very loud , 'Tis just such another great Want , when the Fiddler wants his Crowd : Good people I tell unto you , these Lines they are absolute New , For I hate and despise the telling of Lies , this Ditty is merry and true . A Ship that's without e're a Sail , may be driven the Lord knows whither 'Tis just such another sad want , as the Shoemaker wants his Leather : A Man that has god but one Leg , will make but a pitiful Runner , And he that has no Eyes in his head , will make but a sorrowful Gunner : Good people I tell unto you , these Lines they are absolute New , For I hate and despise the telling of Lies , this Ditty is merry and true . The second part , to the same Tune . A Doctor without any Stomach , will make but a pitiful Dinner , And he that has god no Victuals to eat , will quickly look thinner and thinner : A Bell without ever a Clapper , will make but a sorrowful found , And he that has no Land of his own , may work on another men Ground : Good people I tell unto you , these lines they are absolute New , For I hate and despise the telling of Lies , this Ditty is merry and true . A Blacksmith without his Bellows , he need not to rise very soon , And he that has no Clothes to put on , may lie in his Bed till Noon : And Innkeeper without any Custom , will never get store of Wealth , And if he has ne'r a Sign to hang up , he may e'ne go hang up himself : Good people , etc A Miller without any Stones , he is but a sorrowful Soul , And if that he has no Corn to grind , he need not stand taking of Toll : The Taylor we know he is loath to take any Cabbidge at all , If he has no Silk , Stuff or Cloth , to do that good Office withal : Good people , etc A Woman without e're a Fault , she like a bright Star will appear , But a Brewer without any Malt , will make but pitiful Beer : A Man that has god but one Shirt , when e're it is washed for his Hide , I hope it can't be no great hurt , to lie in his Bed till 'tis dry'd , Good people , etc A Mountebank without his Fools , and a Skip-kennel turn'd out of place , A Tinker without any Tools , they are all in a sorrowful case : You know that a Dish of good Meat , it is the true stay of men Life , But he that has nothing to eat , he need not to draw out his Knife : Good people , etc A Pedlar without e're a Stock , it makes him look pitiful Blue , A Shepherd without e're a Flock , has little or nothing to do : A Farmer without any Corn , he neither can give , fell , or lend , A Huntsman without e're a Horn , his Wife she must stand his good Friend , Good people , etc A Plowman that has ne'r a Blow , I think he may live at his ease , A Dairy without e're a Cow , will make but bad Butter and Cheese : A Man that is pitiful Poor , has little or nothing to lose , And he that has never a Foot , it saves him the buying of Shoes : Good people , etc A Warren without e're a Coney , is Barren , and so much the worse , And he that is quite without money , can have no great need of a Purse ; I hope there is none in this place , that now is displeas'd with this Song : Come buy up my Ballads apace , and i'le pack-up my Awls and be gone ; Good people I tell unto you , these lines they are absolute New , [ F ] or I hate and despise the telling of Lies , this Ditty is merry and true .
