H : 18296v [ A pleasant ] new Ballad of the merry Miller of Mansfield in Sherwoo [ worser , and of King Henry the second , and how he ] was lodged in the Millers house , and of their pleasant communication . To the tune of the French Lavato HEnry our royal King would go on hunting , To the green forest most pleasant and fair : [ TO ] oh have the Heart chased , the dainty Does tripping , [ U ] unto merry Sherwood his nobles repair . Hawk and hound , was unbound , all things prepar'd , for the same , to the game with good regard . [ A ] ll along Summer's day , road the King pleasantly , With all his princes and nobles each one : [ C ] hasing the Heart and Hind , and the Buck gallantly , [ Ti ] ll the dark evening enforced them turn home . then at last riding fast he had lost quite , all his Lords in the woods , late in dark night . Wandering thus wearily , all alone up and down , With a rude Miller he met at the las [ A ] sking the ready way unto fair Nottingham . [ Si ] r quoth the Miller your way you have lost . yet I think , what I think truth for to say , you do not lightly go but of your way . Why what dost thou think of me quoth our king merrily [ P ] assing thy judgement upon me so brief : [ G ] ood faith quoth the Miller I mean not to flatter , [ I ] guess thee to be but a gentleman thief . stand thee back in the dark light not a down , [ l ] east that I presently crack thy knaves crown . Thou dost abuse me much ( quoth our king ) saying thus , [ I ] am a gentleman , lodging I lack : [ TO ] how hast quoth the miller not a groat in thy purse , [ A ] ll thy inheritance hangs on thy back . I have gold to discharge all that I call , If it be fortie pence I will pay all . [ I ] f thou be'st a true man then answered the miller , [ I ] swear by my tole dish isle lodge thee all night , [ H ] eres my hand quoth our King that I was ever : Nay soft quoth the miller thou mayest be a sprite . better isle know thee ere hands I will shake , with none but with honest men hands I will take . Thus they went all along unto the millers house Where they were seething of Puddings and souse : [ TO ] he miller first entered in , after him went the king : [ N ] ever came he in so smoky a house . now quoth he let me see , here what you are , quoth our king look your fill , and do not spare . [ I ] like well thy countenance thou hast and honest face , With my son Richard this night thou shalt lie : Quoth his wife by my troth this a good handsome youth , Yet is it best husband to deal warily art thou not run away , pray thee youth tell , show us thy passport and all shall be well . Then our king presently making low courtesy , With his hat in his hand , thus he did say : I have no passport nor never was serviture , [ B ] ut a poor courtier road out of my way . and for your kindness now proffered to me , I will requite it in every degree . Then to the miller his wife whispered secretly , Saying it seems this youth's of good kin : Both by his apparel and eke by his manners , to turn him out certainly were a great sin . [ y ] ea quoth he , you may see , he hath some grace , [ w ] hen he speaks unto his betters in place . Well quoth the millers wife , young man welcome h [ ere ] And though I say it , well lodged shalt thou be : Fresh straw I will have , laid in your bed so brave Good brown hempen sheets , likewise quoth she . I quoth the goodman and when that is done , you shall lie with no worse then with mine own [ son . ] Nay first quoth Richard , good fellow tell me true , Hast thou no creepers in thy gay hose , Or art thou not troubled with the scrubado ? I pray you quoth our King what things be those ? Art thou not lousy , or scabbed quoth he ? If thou be'st , surely thou liest not with me . This caused our King suddenly laugh out most would [ rtily ] till the tears trickled down from his face : then unto supper were they set orderly , With hight bagpudding , and good apple pies . Nappy ale good and stale in a black boul , which did about all the board merrily troule . Here quoth the Miller , good fellow I drink to tO [ he , ] and to all courtnoles that courteous be , I pledge thee quoth our King , and thank thee har [ tily ] For my good welcome in every degree . and here in like manner I drink to thy son , do so quoth Richard and quick let it come .
