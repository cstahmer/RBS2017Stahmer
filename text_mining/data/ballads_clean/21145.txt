The Countrymans delight : Or , The Happy Wooing : Being the Successful Loves of JOHN the SERIVNG-MAN , In his Courting of JOAN the DAIRY-MAID . John's humble suit Joan does long time withstand , Till his known Wealth her favour does command ; Then mustering all her Smiles , to him she bends , And to the bargain straight she condescends : Now no Objection can retard her Love , If not of him , she does his Wealth approve ; So women for base Gold their Beauty fell , To whom so ever bids most , that cursed spell , Fixed deep into their Souls , commands them still , And guider the Reins of their tempestuous will . To a New Playhouse Tune : Dolly and Molly . John. Q Uoth John to Joan wilt thou have me ? I prithee now wilt thou , i'll marry with thee My Cow , my Cow , my House and Rends , All my Lands and Tennements : Say my Joan , say my Joan , what wilt thou do ? I cannot , I cannot come every every day to woo . I've Corn and Hay in a Barn hard by , And three fat Pigs penned up in a stye ; I have a Mare and she is Coalblack , I ride on her Belly to save her back : Say my Joan , say my Joan , what wilt thou do ? I cannot , I cannot come every every day to woo . I have three Mark tied up in a Rag , I keep them there instead of a Bag ; I have a Cheese upon the Shelf , I'se cannot eat it awe my self : Say my Joan , say my Joan , what wilt thou do ? I cannot , I cannot come every every day to woo . Joan. Quoth Joan to John you must not come , For your Master and Mistress are both at home ; You are a Servant and must obey , Else they'll be angry , and turn you away : Say my John , say my John , is this not true ? You must not , you must not come every every day to woo . John. I love thee Joan with all my heart , Come quickly consent , and we never will part : My Shirt , my Shirt , and eke my Band , All I have is at thy command : Believe me Joan , believe me Joan , I tell thee true , I cannot nown's , I cannot come every every day to woo Joan In troth my John I cannot consent , To gain your Cow , your shirt , and your Rend ; Yet smiling I think of your love , And wish oft I worthy could prove : With a Servingman , with a Serving man i'll not do , who cannot , who dares not come every every day to woe John. Nay my Joan , pray say not so , Ever i'll lose thee , my place i'll forgo , Come kiss my joy , and I will be , A Servant unto none but thee : My Master , my Master i'll bid adieu , I'll leave him , i'll leave him , every every day to woo . Joan. O John , by no means , not for me , I would not your Master and you disagree ; For I shall never have you it's plain , You offered your Bound , but all in vain , Cease you clown , cease you clown , it will not do , though you come , though you come , every every day to woo John. Then yet more my Joany I have , O think not pray , thy Johnny a slave ; I was free born i'll make it appear , My father left me five Marks a year : Believe me Joan , believe me Joan , I tell you true , I will come , I will come , every every day to woo Joan. Come , come , it is no time for delay , Hark John your Mistress calls you away : We must not so sudden agree , For what will the Maids think all of me : Say my John , say my John , is this not true ? You cannot by'th Mass , you cannot come every every day to woo . John. Fear not my Joan , for by this Kiss , They cannot think on it amiss ; Each on they wooed , and wished the like , And conquered by Love , they would soon strike : Say my Joan , say my Joan , is this not true ? I cannot I cannot come every every day to woo . Joan. Well John , you have charmed me I see , My love thou hast wone , I yield it to thee , Though with soft sighs it is expressed , Yet Johnny is lodged in my Breast : Say my John , say my John , what must we do ? You must come , you must come every every day to woo John. O speak it again my dear John , Can it be so quickly that thou art my own ; I'll hug thee , i'll Buss thee , now for this , Thou art my joy , and all my bliss : Say my Joan , say my Joan , is this not true ? Now i'll come , now i'll come every every day to [ woo . ] Well , when is the time you design , That'th Parson in Wedlock may both of u [ s ] [ ? ] John. Uds-foot Joan , to morrow let's meet , And then we'll do all things complete : Say my Joan , say my Joan , does it please you ? Then i'll come , then i'll come every every day to woo . Printed for P.
