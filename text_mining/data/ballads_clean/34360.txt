A A Desperate COMBAT between a WILLIAMITE LADY AND A JACOBITE IN Yorkshire late , happen'd a desperate Fight , Betwixt a Jacobite Lady , and a Williamite : It was fought with such Courage no Man could do more , Nor the like was e'er fought by two Women before : For each met in the Field with the Swords by their side , Resolving the same should their Quarrel decide . It was after this manner this Frey did begin , At a Knights House in Yorkshire , at a Merry Meeting , Where many Ladies and Gentlemen dine , When Dinner was over then round went the wine ; For each drank at that time for their share a whole Quart Then a Bumper went round for a Health at a Draught , Says the Jacobite Lady , Here's a health to our King : Says the Williamite Lady , That Health I'le begin ; In the Field he's a Monarch that's Valiant and Brave , And has ventur'd His Life these Three Kingdoms to save ; So Madam success to King William I say , And to all his Brave Forces by Land and by Sea. The Jacobite Lady being put to a stand , [ S ] he strake off the Glass and the Wine from her Hand , [ A ] and call'd her a Rebel , yea Heretic too , [ ? ] a Bottle to give her a blow ; [ ? ] e did hinder her furious design , [ ? ] ould persuade her to Friendship that time , [ ? ] g they did could her Passion assuage , [ ? ] in a fury , and went in a rage , [ ? ] ng she wrote a Letter with speed : [ ? ] Williamite Lady the same once did read [ ? ] she was challeng'd a Sword she must bring , [ ? ] for her Drinking a health to our King . [ ? ] it of her Brother's Clothes she did put on , [ ? ] ord by her side , so she marched alone , [ ? ] her bold Challenge her fairly to Fight , [ ? ] worser that she feared not any Jacobite . [ ? ] for King William , thus the Jacobite cry'd , [ ? ] and will be while I live , she repli'd . [ ? ] ou and I must have a Trial of Skill , [ ? ] see I'm prepared to be killed or to kill , The [ ? ] avely they pushed at each other I say , Till the Jacobite Lady was forc'd to give way , With their glittering Swords they bravely did push , Till the Jacobite Lady fell back in a Bush. Then a Man that did spy them came running in haste , And held as he thought a young Man by the Waist , While the Lady that's wounded lay blooding did cry , I'm wounded , come help me , or else I shall die . And had not this Brother come by as he did , This secret from me had forever been hid . FINIS .
