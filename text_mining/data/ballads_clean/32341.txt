H : 135933 TO THE LOYAL Company of CITIZENS MET AT Merchant-Tailors Hall . THey're Met , they're Sat , and Loyal Cups go round , And with their Cheers the well-built Walls rebound . The Trojans thus rejoyc'd , when they to Groves , From stormy Billows had their first removes . When Seven fat Bucks AEneas did impart To Ilions Youth , and bid 'em all take Heart . Since from black stormy Gusts and a rough Sea That lately tossed , by Skilful Hands set free , They there enjoy'd a sweet Serenity . Bring out the Bowl , methinks I hear 'em cry , Which Belus , and all Belus Progeny Was wont with Sacred Wine to th'brim to Crown , And let it to Great CHARLES and his go down . And in the interim let some lov'd Youth tell , Fam'd as Iopas , while each string does swell , In Sacred Lore how His Great Father fell . Then sighs each Loyal Soul for's Master slave , Then Cheerly cry , His Heirs we will maintain , Successively on the same Throne to Reign . Thus doing , Loyal LONDON ne'r may want The Charters had when she was Troynovant . Thus doing , this August and Solemn Treat , Will make New LONDON as old Carthage great ; When true AEneas and his Faithful Band , Queen Dido's Royal Table entertain'd . LONDON : Printed for W.B.
