A Congratulatory POEM To His Royal Highness the Prince of Orange , Or His Welcome to the CITY of LONDON . HAIL mighty Prince ! this Poem on you waits , As the first Offering that Celebrates Your welcome to the Town , almost Destro'yd By Priestcraft , and by you again Revived ; This Glorious Day ( in which all Triumphs Live ) To Heaven , and you Great Sir , we only Give . When Jove first made the World , he asked no more Of us , but taught us whom we should implore As then , so now it's our peculiar care , With Joyful thanks to gratify your ear , Who from the Dust has raised our Groveling State , Which hung upon the weakest Wheel of Fate And Act so high , and past mankinds believing That none but you could ere think of retrieving Yet more , they who this Nation would enthral , Do fill your Triumph with their wretched fallen , But what dose Heaven impart when they Design To Act something that's Noble and Divine ? Prophetic Stars this happy time never knew , This Secret only Lodged in Heaven , and you , And mighty Prince , ( since Fate decrees it so ) Our Lives unto your Generous Sword we owe , Not only , but Estates and Liberty , Which is the Sum of all felicity . Exhaled from sullen frowns our Kingdom's Blessed , And in the umbrage of your Lawralls rest , While Joy like Lightning in Tempestuous Storms Dazzles the World and fills it with Alarms , Joy now to Loudest Triumph makes its way And we not Difference know between Night and Day , Our Souls transported in strong Raptures move And yet United are in Artless Love , Joy now and Love so very well agree As if this year was the first Jubilee , Of Care and Business we'll no more allow Since Deathless Lawralls flourish on your brow , Go on brave Prince what i'st you can't effect Whom Heaven with prosporous Stars dose still protect , The fury of your Sword , Let the French feel , That Kingdom is Designed by you to reel ; Pull down their Gaudy Pride which long hath stood And their own Fields Manure with their own Blood , Come here's the Prince's Health a Brimmer round And all the Popish Interest Confound , Veni , Vidi , Vici .
