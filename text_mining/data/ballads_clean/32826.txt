To the KING . Dii Patrii , Indigetes , et Romule , Vestaq ; Mater , Quae Tuscum Tiberim et Romana Palatia servas , Hunc saltem everso juvenem succurrere saeclo Ne prohibete . -------------- Virg. AS a found Mother anxious for her Son , Whom raging Seas and Winds detain from Home ; No less impatient , Winds and Waves we fear'd Till You auspicious on our Coasts appear'd . But smiling Joys now fit on ev'ry Face , All striving who shall most Your Triumph Grace ; Rejoicing that wherever You Command , There JUSTICE Reigns with and impartial Hand ; There ARTS prevail ; and VIRTUE from Above Inspires each Breast with UNITY and LOVE ; TRUTH , LIBERTY , and MERCY there abound , And PEACE with downy Wings sits brooding on the Ground . Accept , GREAT SIR , these Realms for You design'd , Tho' far beneath Your Worth and greater Mind . 'Twas Here the EDWARDS did the Sceptre sway ; The People Here the HENRYS did obey ; And Here NASSAU his Virtues did display . Like Him propitious on BRITANNIA smile ; Like Him defend , and save our sinking I'le ; Like Him on Earth the Golden Age renew , And the GREAT WILLIAM's Steps to Heav'n pursue . To the KING .
