The Countryman's Prophecy , Plainly setting forth when Popery will return into England again . The Tune of , Covetousness out of England will run . A LL you that strange Prophecies love for to hear , Give heed to my words which now I declare ; As the Nose on your face , you'll find it so plain , When Popery will return into England again . When P eters to Lime-street again does repair , And with his vile hands the Bible does tear , And against all our Laws his Treasons maintain , Then Popery will return , etc When the Bald-pated Villains our Nation infest , That damn all those Churchmen won't take off the Test , And to put down our Bishops they use might and main , Then Popery will return , etc When Papists in Eminent Stations are placed , And Protestants all turned out with disgrace , And bloodthirsty Teagues our Religion maintain , Then Popery will return , etc When a Nun with a Fryer together lives Chaste , And thinks it a since for to finger her Waste , And though this not Lent , yet from Flesh will abstain , Then Popery will return , etc When the Pope that now sits in Infallible Chair , To Convert this Nation shall hither repair , And Protestants seek his favour to gain , Then Popery will return , etc When Fleet-street and Holbourn affords never a Whore , And Misers their Money do throw to the Poor ; When their lost Reputations they both shall obtain , Then Popery will return , etc When Welch-men no more will eat toasted Cheese , And Lawyers refuse the taking of Fees ; When Cowards like Hectors their Valours maintain , Then Popery will return , etc When Maidens at fifteen their Sweethearts forget , And when god to twenty don't long for a bit ; And once they are Married desire not to Reign , Then Popery will return , etc When Christmas does fallen in the middle of June , And good Musics made when the Crowds out of tune , And Ships you see sailing on Salisbury Plain , Then Popery will return , etc When Men to each other prove Loving and kind , Of several Religions , yet all of a mind , And always their word they justly retain , Then Popery will return , etc When all these strange things do come to your view , And every one of them does prove to be true , ( You'll find I'm no Liar , but a Countryman plain ) Then Popery will return into England again .
