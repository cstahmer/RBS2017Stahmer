The French Prophet . Or , A New Touch of the Times . I Am and old Prophet , and newly come over , to tell you the Truth I was born in France , Last Monday was Se'nnight I landed at Dover , The Truth is the Truth , and is no Romance : Then cheer up your Hearts , your Spirits raise , And remember the Nation is now in its Prime ; Then let us be jolly , and drown Melancholy , I warrant , brave Boys , we have golden Times . When the Name of Cuckold is quite forgotten , And Wheat shall be sold for a Groat the Coomb ; When Drunkards forget to handle their Pot , And the City of London is joined to Room : When Vintners neglect to use their Chalk , And Poets forget to make their Rhimes ; When Pimps are all rotten , and whoring forgotten , I'll warrant , etc When Conscience is prized more than Gold , And the Tower of London runs upon Wheels ; When fractious old Women forget to scold , And the Monument has a fine Ring of Bells' : When Norwich Castle goes to Christ Church , And all for to hear St. Peter's Chimes ; When Lovers leave lying , and Birds leave off flying , I'll warrant , etc When Cucumbers grow upon Sycamore Trees , And Knavery is turn'd out of Doors ; When a Miss of the Town refuses a Crown , And Swearing and Lying are used no more ; When a Quack does come to visit a Whore , And the Kingdom of England is all of one Mind ; When Pigs forget grunting , and Cats ride a hunting , I'll warrant , etc When Landlords they refuse their Renfs , And Tailors make their Bills too short ; When Bakers make their Bred too large ; And are made to stand in the Pillory for't ; When a Welshman eats no toasted Cheese ; I'll warrant , etc When Malice and Envy are laid quite aside , and honesty lov'd by rich and poor ; When Charity's lov'd more than Pride , And Millers forget to take Toll any more : When Sailors refuse to take their Pay , And the Rich to the Poor grow loving and kind ; When Women leave Washing , and Cows go a Fishing , I'll warrant , etc When Maids choose a single Life , And will not be married at twenty Years ; When Eels have god Legs , like Shoemakers Pegs , And Willow Trees bear Warden Pears : When Sugar and Salt are both of a Taste , And Misers become both free and kind ; And Candlemas falls on the Eeventh of May , I'll warraat , etc When Houses are with Pancakes til'd , And Vinegar runs like Water Springs ; When Mankind are all of a Mind , And England is blessed with a King or a Queen , When Cocks ride out in Boots and Spurs , And Mackerel are catch'd without Net or Line ; When the Cheats of the Nation are quite out of Fashion I'll warrant , etc When Paul's Church goes for a Man of War , Mann'd with old Women to fight for the Nation ; When Bakers forget to gripe the Poor , And Whoring is clearly out of Fashion ; When Beaus they do a hunting ride . And Winter is passed without Frost or Rhime : These Things they may be , but few will them see , Until the Devil is grown lame and blind . The French Prophet . Or , A New Touch of the Times .
