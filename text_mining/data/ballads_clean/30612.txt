The DESPAIRING LOVER . Whose Mind with Sorrow much was discontented , Because of his true Love he was provented . To the Tune of , Aim not too high . BReak heart and die , I may no longer live , T' enjoy this World nothing that I would give , I live forlorn , all joys are from me fled , I have lost my Love , alas , my heart is dead ! Each thing on earth continueth with his Love , The pretty Hidgeon and the Turtledove ; And diverse others in this World I know , But my Love will not seem to love me so . I little thought what true I now [ worser ] oh find , I did not dream my Love would prove unkind ; But 'tis no news , for many proves untrue , And so does mine , for she bids me adieu . Seeing 'tis so , i'll turn a Palmer poor , And I will range abroad the World half o'er , To see if I can find some dismal cave . There will I dwell , there will I dig my grave . I will go travel to some new found Lan [ worser ] , To France to Spain and Turky out of hand ; Where unto Strangers there I will complain , How that my Love hath me unkindly slave . If I do land upon some new found shore , Whereas no M [ a ] n did ever land before , Then should I think myself in happy case , For my delight is in a silent place . There will I write my fill of my true Love ; Did I s [ a ] y true ? what fancy did me move , To count her true that always was unkind , [ And is as fickle as the wavering wind ? ] [ Once she was fair and lovely in my sighed , ] [ ? ] But now her smiles are turn'd to frowns and fire , To kill my heart with woe is her desire . Bright Phebus beams are darkened in the skies , When as the storms of Boreas do arise ; But she does quickly shine after the rain , But my coy Mistress will not love again . I would I were now sinking in the Seas In some frait vessel , if the Fates did please : Where neither love nor comfort could be found , But every hour expecting to be drown'd . My speeches all do but prolong my pain , For I did never sail the Ocean main ; Nor will I suffer life in me to 'bide , So long to wait the time of wind and tide . Seeing 'tis so , to the wilderness i'll high , among wild beasts , where I intend to die ; Where lyons , tigers , bears , and panthers mourn , With dragons , elephants and unicorn . Thus many wishes I have wished in vain , And none of those can ease me of my pain : This piercing poniard now shall end the strife , And kill my heart that loathes this mortal life . This being spoken , forth his Love did rush , Beholding him with many a smile and blush , Oh hold , quoth she , and hear what I do say , Do not despair , nor work thy lives decay .
