AND ELEGY ON THE USURPER O.C. BY THE AUTHOR OF Absalom and Achitophel , published to show the Loyalty and Integrity of the POET . AND now 'tis time for their Officious haste , Who would before have born him to the Sky Like eager Roman e're all rites were passed , Did let too soon the sacred Eagle fly . Though our best Notes are Treason to his Fame , Joyn'd with the loud Applause of public Voice , Since Heaven the praise we offer to his Name , Hath rendered too Authentic by its Choice . Though in his Praise no Arts can lib'ral be , Since they whose Muses have the highest flown , Add not to his Immortal Memory , But do and Act of Friendship to their own . Yet 'tis our Duty and our Interest too , Such Monuments as we can built to raise , lest all the World prevent what we should do , And claim a title in him by their praise . How shall I then begin or where conclude , To draw a Frame so truly circular ? For in a Round what Order can be shew'd , Where all the parts so equal perfect are ? His Grandeur he deriv'd from Heaven alone ; For he was great e're Fortune made him so , And Wars like Mists that rise against the Sun ; Made him but Greater seem , not Greater grow . No borrow'd Bays his Temples did adorn , But to our Crown he did fresh Jewels bring ; Nor was his Virtue poison'd soon as born , With the too early thoughts of being King . Fortune ( that easy Mistress of the young , But to her Ancient Servants coy and hard ; ) Him at that Age her Favorites ranck't among , He private , mark't the Faults of others sway , And set as Sea-marks for himself to shun , Not like rash Monarchs who their youth betray By Acts , their Age too late would wish undone . And yet Dominion was not his design , We owe that Blessing not to him but Heaven , Which to fair Acts rewards unsought did join ; Rewards which less to him than us were given . Our former Chiefs like Sticklers in the War , First sought t'enflame the Parties , then to poize , The Quarrel lov'd , but did the Cause abhor , And did not strike to hurt , but make a noise . War , our Consumption , was their gainful Trade , We inward bled while they prolong'd our pain , He fought to end our Fightings , and Essaid ' To staunch the Blood by breathing of a Vein . Swift and resistless through the Land he passed , Like that bold Greek who did the East subdue , And made to Battle such Heroic haste , As if on Wings of Victory he flew . He fought secure of Fortune as of Fame , 'Till by new Maps the Island might be shown , Of Conquests which he strew'd where e're he came Thick as the Galaxy with Stars is sown . His Palms though under weights , they did not stan [ worser ] Still thriv'd , no Winter could his Laurels fade , Heaven in his portrait shew'd a Workman's hand , And drew it perfect yet without a shade . Peace was the Price of all his Toils and Care , Which War had banished and did now restore , Bolognia's Wall thus mounted in the Air [ ? ] safety rescued , Ireland to him owes , [ ? ] treacherous Scotland to no In'trest true ; Yet blessed that Fate which did his Arms dispose , Her Land to civilize as to subdue . Nor was he like those Stars which only shine , When to pail Mariners they Storms portend , He had his calmer Influence , and his Mein Did Love and Majesty together blend . 'Tis true , his Count'nance did Imprint and Awe , And Nat'rally all Souls to his did bow , As wands of Divination downward draw , And point to Beds where Sovereign Gold does grow .

No Civil Broils have since his Death arose , But Faction now by habit does obey ; And Wars have that respect for his repose , As Winds for Halcyons when they breed at Sea. His Ashes in a peaceful Urn shall rest , His Name and great example stand to show How strangely high endeavours may be blessed , Where Piety and Valour Jointly go . POSTSCRIPT .
