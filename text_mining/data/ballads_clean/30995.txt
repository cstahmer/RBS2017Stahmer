The Ballad of the CLOAK : Or , The Cloaks Knavery . To the Tune of , From Hunger and Cold : Or , Packington's Pound . COme buy my new Ballet , I have't in my Wallet , But 'twill not I fear please every Pall Then mark what ensu'th , I swear by my Youth , That every Line in my Ballad is truth , A Ballad of Wit , a brave Ballad of worth , 'Tis newly Printed , and newly come forth : 'Twas made of a Cloak that fell out with a Gown , That cramped all the Kingdom , and crippl'd the Crown . I'le tell you in brief , A Story of Grief , Which happen'd when Cloak was Commander in Chief : It tore Common-Prayers , Imprison'd Lord Mayors , In one day it voted down Prelates and Players : It made people in point of Obedience , And the Covenant did cut off the Oath of Allegiance . Then let us endeavour to pull the Cloak down , That cramped all the Kingdom , and crippl'd the Crown . It was a Black Cloak , In good time be it spoke , That kill'd many thousands , but never struck stroke : With Hatchet and Rope , The Forlorn Hope , Did join with the Devil to pull down the Pope : It set all the Sects in the City to work , And rather then fail , 'twould have brought in the Turk : Then let us endeavour , etc It seiz'd on the Tow'r Guns , Those fierce Demi-Gorgons , It brought in the Bagpipes , and pull'd down the Organs The Pulpits did smoke , The Churches did Choke , And all our Religion was turn'd to a Cloak : It brought in Lay-Elders could not write nor Read , It set public Faith up , and pull'd down the Creed : Then let us endeavour , etc This Pious Imposter , Such fury did foster , It left us no Penny , nor no Paternoster ; It threw to the ground , Ten Commandments down , And set up twice twenty times ten of its own : It routed the King , and Villians Elected , To plunder all those whom they thought disaffected : Then let us endeavour , etc To blind peoples eyes , This Cloak was so wise , It took off Ship-money , but set up Excise ; Men brought in their Plate , For Reasons of State , And gave it to Tom Trumpeter and his Mate : In Pamphlets it writ many specious Epistles , To cozen poor Wenches of Bodkins and Whistles : Then let us endeavour to pull the Cloak down , That cramped all the Kingdom , and crippl'd the Crown . IN Pulpits it moved , And was much approved , For crying out ------ Fight the Lords Battle Beloved ; It bob-tayl'd the Gown , Put Prelacy down , It trod on the Mitre to reach at the Crown : And into the field it and Army did bring , To aim at the Council but shot at the King : Then let us endeavour , etc It raised up States , Whose Politic Pates , Do now keep their Quarters on the City Gates : To Father and Mother , To Sister and Brother , It gave a Commission to Kill one another : It took up Men's Horses at very low rates , And Plunder'd our Goods to secure our Estates ; Then let us endeavour , etc This Cloak did proceed To a Damnable deed , It made the best Mirror of Majesty bleed : Though Cloak did not do't , He set it on Foot , By Rallying and calling his Journey-men to' For never had come such a Bloody Disaster , If Cloak had not first drawn a Sword to his Master : Then let us endeavour , etc Though some of them went hence , By sorrowful Sentence , This lofty long Cloak is not mov'd to Repentance ; But he and his Men , Twenty Thousand times ten , Are plotting to do their Tricks over again : But let this proud Cloak to Authority stoop , Or CATCH will provide him a Button and Loop : Then let us endeavour to pull the Cloak down , That basely did sever the Head from the Crown . Let's pray that the King , And his Parliament , In Sacred and Secular Things may consen So Righteously firm , And Religiously free ; That Papists and Atheists suppressed may be : And as there's one Deity does over-reign us , One Faith , and one From , & one Church may contain us : Then peace , Truth and plenty , our Kingdom will Crown , And all popish plots and their plotters shall down .
