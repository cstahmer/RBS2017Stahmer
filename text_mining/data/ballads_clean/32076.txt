A Pleasant new SONG , [ to ] the Tune of , Ladies of London . YOu that are summon'd , fail not to appea [ r ] as well out of Suburbs as City : The young foolish Cuckolds must march i [ n ] the Rear led on by the hornified witty : But have a care you march not too close , for your Horns will so woundily rattle , That the Country Bumkin will fancy , God knows you're a head of some Outlandish Cattle . Rip off the Fringe from your wives Petticoat and put all your Gloves in the fashion ; For they'l get more , or they'l cut all the throats of the young Cuckold-makers ith' Nation . For if you come not decently dressed , they'l scoff at you all for your labour ; The Brothers will think you some intruding Guest that has borrow'd your Horns of your Neighbour . Bring all your Horns tipped with Silver good store that we e're we part may be merry , While our wives in our absence lie coining of more in a mould that does seldom miscarry . For who would e're be so simply proud , or so very nice in his Diet , As not to let any man taste of his Food , if he knows he shall get money by it . You that are Cuckolds , and live with content , are surely the happiest of Creatures ; You live merry here , then to Heaven are sent , through means of your wives good nature's . Therefore let them their liberty take , and never desire to debar it , Since you by your Neighbours are lov'd for her sake , and live the more happily for it . This may be printed , R.P.
