The Distressed Damsels ; OR , [ A Do ] lefull Ditty of a sorrowful Assembly of young Maidens that were met together near Thames-street , to bewail the Loss of their Loves which were lately press'd away to Sea. To the Tune of and Orange . Licensed according to Order . MY sweet Sister Sue , ah ! what I shado ? I fain wou'd be married but know notl to who ; [ F ] or why , I protest , the young Men are Pressed , [ A ] and my Sweetheart Robin is gone with the rest For a Seaman . Then Susan reply'd there's many beside , That Fortune this Summer will surely divide ; Each sudden surprise will cause Lasses cries , While Tears they do trickle like Rain from the Skies , For our Sweethearts , There's Bess at the Bell you know her full well , A sorrowful story to me she did tell , That Thomas her Dear , was Pressed she did hear , And then the poor Creature did tremble for fear He should leave her . In Thames-street of late , young pretty-fac'd Kate Had lost her dear sweating , the Bricklayer her Mate ; He was pressed away but yet the next day They freed him , then Kate she did lovingly say . My sweet Johnny . In the open Street her John she did meet , And gave him a thousand soft Kisses so sweet , With stroking his Chin , she welcom'd him in , For Joy she was fit to leap out of her Skin , For her Johnny . There's Doll at the Swan , her true Love is gone , Poor Heart she with sorrow does sighs and take on ; Yet all is in vain , he is gone to the Main , She fears that he ne'er will return home again , To embrace her . There's Bridget & Joan 'tis very well known , Of Fourteen young Sweethearts they have not left one But all Pressed on Board for to stand by the Sword , And this do's much Sorrow and Trouble afford , At the Parting . If Pressing goes on , there wont be a Man To please a young Lass , let her do what she can , For they will be scarce here in a short space , Then we shall be all in a sorrowful case , To be Married . Two Twelvemonths ago , sweet Sister you [ know , ] The Bachelors then we could bring to our [ Bow , ] Nay , at our Command , they stood Cap in [ hand , ] But now they grow scarcy all over the Land , We must prize them . Young Nancy and Ned last week they were [ Wed , ] And within and hour of going to Bed , Just in all their Pride he was Pressed from he [ r side , ] Before he had dallied one Night with his Br [ idem . ] Want it Pity ? To leave his delight , and Beauty so bright , Before he had ever enjoy'd her one Night ; But what shall we say ? he was Pressed away , Now you that have Husbands adore them , I [ pray ] They are Jewels . Last year I declare , young Maids was cho [ ice Beware , ] But now they grow wondered plenty I sweet [ ear , ] All over the Town they walk up and down , I reckon you may have a Score for a Crow [ n ] By Midsummer .
