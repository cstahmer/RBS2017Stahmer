When Beggar-men they are chosen for Sheriffs and Tailors forswear ever playing the Thieves When brokers shall turn honest men at the last Then you may be sure the worst is past . When women shall know how to govern their Tongues and the poor no more shall receive any wrongs When Thieves at the Gallows are all tied up fast , Then you may be , etc When Soldiers no more to the Wars they shall go nor Waterman on the River shall row When Debtors no more into prison are cast , Then you may be , etc When Misers shall throw away Silver and Gold and impudent Whores no longer be bold When Pick-pockets prove honest men at the last Then you may be , etc When Tally-men they for no profit shall fell and sick shall be stronger than those that are well Then Lawyers shall plead without Fees at the last Then you may be , etc When Atheists shall go to Church for Devotion and drunkards for greediness drink up the Ocean When the Fish shall forsake the Fresh-rivers at last , Then you may be , etc When Phoebus and Luna no longer shall shine and the Clouds they drop down great showers of wine .
