WHEN W ------ on cants , and L ------ g bauls Out , Oh! our Kirk is shogan ; Then Simson's Sense and Reason falls Before great A ------ n L ------ n , II This learned L ------ n Orthodox , 'Midst heavy Hums , and Haughing , Speaks short and pithy ; raps his Box , And keeps th' Assembly laughing . III . Lang may Laconic L ------ n live , And rise in Fame and Riches , To sift Simsonians in the Sieve Of Creeds , ------ and prick the Witches . IV. This second-sighted Seer sees Farer by Inspiration , Than he , who by black Nature flees For Light , to Education . V. Ah! would th' Assembly make and Act , To put down Pagan Fooling , With College-lear , --- not worth a Plack , To Saints who need no Schooling . VI . In lengthened Speech then each might blaze A Star , like bright G ------ spy ; While learned Reason but betrays , Like Willy with the Wispy . VII . Ah!

Could you with all your boasted Light , Foundations lay to rear on : A Fame that towers to such a Height , As that of J ------ n Mac ------ n . A BALLAD BY J ----- n B ----- s . I .
