A New SONG of Moggie's Jealousy : OR Jockies Vindication Moggy from Jockey she needs wou'd depart , Though Jockey he lov'd his Moggy at heart ; Jockey he wondered at Moggies strange huff , But Moggy was jealous , and that was enough . Tune of , You London Lads be merry ; Or , Woo't thou be wilful still my Joe . THere was and a bonny young Lad ; was keeping of bonny win Sheep ; There was and a bonny young Lass , was a wading the waters so deep : Was a wading the waters so deep , and a little above her knee ; And still she cry'd bonny Lad , wilt thou come and Mow with me ? Where art thou ganging my moggy ? and where art thou ganging my Dove And woo't thou go from thy poor jockey , and so dearly that he does love ? I'm ganging to fair Edenborough , to spir for a Lad that is true ; And if I return not to morrow , then Jockey I'm bid thee adieu . How thinkest thou that I can endure , to part with thee all a long night ? When I am not able , thou art sure , to have thee once out of my sighs 'Tis a folly my Jockey to flatter , for I must gang where I did tell , Or offer to mince up the matter , so Jockey I'm bid thee farewell . BUt shall I gang with thee , my fair one , and shall I gang with thee my Joe ? And shall it be welcome my dear one , to gang with my moggy , or no ? We'l hand in hand trip to the house , that stands within ken of the Town : And there I will have a carouse , and for ever take leave of my loon . But what have I done my moggy , that thou art so willing to part With poor unfortunate jockey , and break his too loving heart . I'm warrant his heart for a Plack , ye'as mere a Mon then to rue , For a thing that you cannot lack , and so Jockey I'm bid thee adieu . Then must we part , my jewel , and I never see thee no mere ? And canst thou be so cruel , to eyn that loves thee lo dear ? And have I not lov'd thee as muckle , and have I not shown it as true ? But I scorn to another to truckle , so Jockey I'm bid thee adieu . Now Heaven preserve my good woman , Ods Bred , she's jealous I trow ; My moggy these tyers are not common , thy heart has had muckle to do : 'Tis only a lovesick mistake , that ever can make me untrue ; But the Parson amends he shall make , if you never will bid me adieu . How willingly I do believe thee , and tie thee once more to my heart But if thou again does deceive me , for ever , for ever we'l par But I'm am in hope's that my Jockey , will never more prove so untrue ; But ever be kind to his moggy , nor I'm never bid him adieu .
