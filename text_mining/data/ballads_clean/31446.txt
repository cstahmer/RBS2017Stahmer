The Hanover Line . WHen William , Duke of Normandy , With all his Normans gallantly , This Kingdom did subdue ; Full fifteen Years of Age I was , And whate'er since has come to pass , I can report for true . I can remember since he went From London for to conquer Ken Where in a walking Wood , The Men of Kent compassed him , And he for Aye confirm'd to them , King Edward's Laws for Good . Likewise I William Rufus knew , And saw the Arrow that him slew , Hard by a Forest Side : I well could tell you if I list , Or better tell you if I wist , Who next to him did ride . First Henry , aye , and Stephen knew , Whom no Man there but I did view , I saw them Crown'd , and Dead : I can remember well also The Second Henry's royal Show ; The Day that he was wed . I likewise was at Woodstock Bower , And saw that sweet and famous Flower , Queen Eleanor did so spigh I found the Clew of Thread again , After that worthy Knight was slave ; 'Twas green , blue , read and white . I saw King Richard in his Shirt , Pull out a furious Lion's Heart , Whereby his Strength was try'd : I saw King John , when as the Monk Gave him the Poison which he drunk , And then forsooth he dy'd . I mark'd the Barons when they sent For the French Dauphin , with Intent To put Third Henry down : I saw the Earl of Leicester stout , ( Call'd , Simon Munford ) with his Tent Besiege fair London Town . And I have the First Edward seen , Whose Legs I still thought to have been A Yard and more in Length : With him I into Scotland went , And back again incontinent , Which he subdu'd by Strength . I knew Carnarvon's Minion dear , And saw the Fallen of Mortimer , With all the Barons Wars : I likewise was in Armour sent To Burton Battle upon Trent , Where I receiv'd these Scars . Third Edward , and his valiant Son , By whom great Feats of Arms were done , I saw on Cressy Plain ; Which Day , when Bows and Arrows keen Grew scant , with mighty Stones I ween , Were many Frenchmen slave . I knew What Tyler , and Jack Straw , And I the Mayor of London saw , In Smithfield , which him slew : I was at Pomfret Castle , when The Second Richard there was slave , Whose Death e'er since I rue . I saw when Henry Bolingbrook , The Crown and Sceptre on him took ; Which he became full well : I saw when Henry Hotspur he , And many Lords at Salisbury , Were slave in Battle fell . I saw the brave victorious Prince , Whose Death I have bewail'd e'er since , Henry the Fifth , I mean : And I can give you just Report , How many French at Agincourt , Were in one Battle slave . I saw the White and Read rose Knight , And Warwick Great , in Armour bright , In the Sixth Henry's Reign : And present was that very Hour , When Henry was in London Tower , By crook'd Back'd Richard slave . I in the Goldsmith's Shop have seen , Fourth Edward's famous Concubine ; Whose Name was sweet Jane Shore : I saw when Richard's Cruelty , Did put her to great Misery ; And I was griev'd therefore . I also was at Bosworth Field , Well armed there with Spear and Shield , Meaning to try my Force ; Where Richard losing Life and Crown , Was naked born to Leicester Town , Upon a Collier's Horse . To the Seventh Henry then I was A Servant , as it came to pass ; To serve him at his Need : And while I did in Court remain , I saw in the Eighth Henry's Reign , Full many great Men bleed . I was a Soldier bold with him , O'er Neptune's curled Breast did swim Unto the Realm of France : I help'd to Ransack Bullogin Town , And many Places of Renown , Yet Home I came by Chance . I knew Sixth Edward of a Child , Whose Countenance was very mild , A hopeful Prince he was : I knew Queen Marry in her Reign , Put Protestants to much Pain , And reset up the Mass. And to my Comfort I have seen Elizabeth , that Maiden Queen , Queen Mary's only Sister : Though she reign'd four and forty Years , Her Subject's shew'd well by their Tears , That they too soon had miss'd her . I saw King James come from the North , Like to a Star that shines forth , To glad the People's Sighs He brought a Salve to cure our Wound , And made Great Britain safe and found , Through Equity and Right . He was in Troth a Prince of Peace , And made all former Jars to cease , 'Twixt English Men and Scots : The English Men sung merry Sonnets , The Scots they then threw up their Bonnets For Joy of their good Lots . In Scotland born , in England nursed , Was Pious Princely Charles the First , Who had to Wife Queen Marry : But by the Rage of Rebels Hate , Murther'd and martyr'd at his Gate , This good King did miscarry . King Charles the Second that had spent Many long Years in Banishment , And 'scap'd with Life so nearly ; By Miracles and Means unknown , I saw plac'd on the Royal Throne , Where he did shine most clearly . I saw his Royal Brother James , Who was led on to such Extremes , Which made the Nation weep : I saw his Coronation-day , And how he did the Sceptre sway , Which long he could not keep . Lord Chancellor I saw likewise , When he did Rule and Tyrannise , By Arbitrary Power : And I was in the Council-room , When Peters he was pleas'd to doom The Bishops to the Tower . I present was that very Morn , When the Pretender he was born , Being the Tenth of June ; In Sixteen Hundred Eighty Eigh But this Day prov'd unfortunate , It put all out of Tune . I saw King William cross the Seas , To give the Land and Nation Ease , With a most glorious Flee I saw him cross to Ireland , With a right valiant armed Band , Making his Foes retreat . I have his Royal Consort seen , Marry , our most Religious Queen ; In all her Courtly Train : I saw her Royal Funeral , And how the Showers of Tears did fallen , While Subject's did complain . I saw the Duke of Gloucester's Birth , The Glory , Triumph , Joy and Mirth , That was on this great Day ; I saw his Royal Mother's Tears , When in the Blossom of his Years , Death snatch'd hence away . I saw King William , when he dy'd , Who was the Land The Wandering JEW's CHRONICLE ; Or , A Brief History of the Remarkable Passages from WILLIAM the Conqueror ; to this present Reign .
