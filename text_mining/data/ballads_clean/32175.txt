H : 49812 SELFE ; OR , A RIDDLE , Called the MONSTER . By T.J. RIddle my Riddle ( for I mean to pose ye ) What is it Raiseth ye , Yet Overthrows ye ? What is't That makes Men deny to pay Tribute ? Soar to a Scepter , yet sink to a Jibbet ? What makes 'Disputants keep such a puther , Shutting the Gates of Bliss , One against t'other ? What is it makes a Man ( by Toil and Labour , With all the wit he can ) to Cheat his Neighbour ? lest this Enigma should too much involve Yey , Extend your Intellect , I shall resolve Ye : SELF is that Monster , which swallows up Allthings ; Makes low things , high things , brings great things , to small things . SELF hath his Sov'raignty ( more is the pity ) In Church , Court , Country , Camp , Navy , and City . What e're the Voyage be , SELF has the Venture ; Where e're the Circle be , SELF is the Centre . SELF in this season , is the only Object ; SELF is a Sov'raign , and SELF is a Subjec SELF is a Stats-man , that pleads for Applauses , SELF would be Chancellor in his own Causes . SELF , into every Species can vary , SELF's Eccleastical , and Military : SELF will be meddling with Kingdoms , and Crowns too , SELF can built Houses , and SELF can fell Towns too . SELF , once rais'd War , between Swede and Poland , And betwixt England , France , Denmark , and Holland : SELF hath a Signiory in every Region , SELF is of any , and of no Religion : SELF is a Self-seeker , and SELF is a Shaker ; SELF is a Prpist , and SELF is a Quaker : SELF makes a Protestant sometime to falter , And bids a Prisbiter , bow to the Altar . SELF hatch'd the War , and the fatal Infection : SELF set the City in flaming distraction , SELF was the Plotter , SELF was Prejector , SELF was the sufferer , and SELF was the Actor : SELF was the Fireball , that brought with it's flashes , Englangs Metropolis , to Dust and Ashes : SELF was a Thing made such work for Repayers , Which scarce will be finish'd , by Him or his Heirs . SELF was a Person ( though not very witty ) Which in that season , was Spark of the City . SELF is a Serpent , whose intreges are Oblick : SELF is the ruin of ev'ry Republic : SELF is the motive , so many are undone , SELF was the Burning and Downfall of London ; Though SELF ( in confidence ) thought He was able To quench the fury on't , with his small Babble . SELF is a Courtier that seems to adore ye , And spreads his formal fine faviours before ye , But if your Suit at Court , have not some pelf in't , Hee'l give you cause to perceive there was Self in't . SELF is a Countryman , when fire inforces Men to make use of his Wagons and Horses ; When Goods and Money were shar'd in four Quarters , By Fire , and by Felons , by Traitors , and Carters . SELF was a Traiton , a Turncoat , a Teacher : SELF , and Pluerallities , makes up a Preacher . SELF is a Shopkeeper , One that will ply ye , With see what you lack Sir ; But gets nothing by ye : SELF is so many Things , no Man can name all : SELF's and Hermaphrodite , both Male and Female . SELF in a Woman's the root of all Evil , And gives cause to say , SELF is a Devil . SELF do Self-have , is a severe old Sentence ; And SELF does daily make work for Repentance . Let him be Englishman , Spaniard , or Roman , When each Man's for himself , then God is for no Man : And you shall find it true ( if well you pause on't ) What Mischiefs e're ensue , SELF is the Cause on' SELF is and inlet to every Disaster : He that denies him-SELF , is his own Master .
