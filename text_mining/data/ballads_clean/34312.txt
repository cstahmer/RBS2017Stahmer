COme Master Taylor let us try Who wins the Battle , you [ ? ] ; Lay by your Nidle , Goose , and sheers , [ ? ] you and I go by the Ears . But take this Cave't by the way : What here of Tailors I do say , Of all is not t'be understood , In every Calling some are good . The Tailors you call pretty Fellows , You [ ? ] , better Men has god the Gallow [ s ] ; But let us see for what you prize tO [ ? ] m , Ere we begin t' Anatomise them . And first you say , ( or I mistake it ) Without their Works we would go naked . Next that this Calling did begin Just on the back of Man's first since And so its Antiquity reaches , Since the first minute Man wore Breeces : And Room sure can no sooner state Their own Religion's ancient date And that their Work is us'd by Both high and low , both great a [ ? ] ll , All sorts & sizes , rich and poor The honest Woman and the Whore Well , is this all , or what more say [ ? ] e Speak what you please I dare defy y [ ? ] In any thing you can say further , Though oft a Taylor's Tongue be harder Than e'er his Hands were found to be This Truth is known , I do not lie . They say some of them , though but young Can clip Clouts with their very Tongue But wherefore stand I thus to babble The Matter let us fairly Table : And first and foremost it is granted That Tailors cannot well be wanted What then ? a Man his Arse noth need As well as Liver , Heart , or Head ; Therefore the Bum says to the Eye , I'm more to be esteem'd than thee : Without Eyes Living Men there's some [ ? ] But never one that wants a Bum. T' illustrate this ; In Man there's hurl'd The whole Abridgement of the World ; His Head or Brain does represent Him that has the chief Gover'ment . The Clergy may be call'd the Eye , That most in secret Things do see ; Also the Tongue to tell the rest What way to steer their Course is best . The Sould'ers may be call'd the Arms That does the Body guard from Harms . The Merchant may be call'd the Heart That gives Life to every part . I know this is by some deny'd And to the Husbandman apply'd . Well , let us then go try the matter , And see which o' us shall have the better , Now Money is the thing you know That only makes the Mare to go , And where is Money to be had But in the Hands of Men of Trade ? Is't not by Trade the Hogan Dutch Has now increas'd their State so much ? And has not England that same way Adv [ ? ] 'd to such a Monarchy ? In sho [ ? ] what Nation great is made , But chiefly by the Means of Trade ? Most of Princes Rends each where Are Custom dues , on Merchant Ware . What necessary is't you can have , But what from Merchant's you receive ? If you want Money then 'tis he That only can your want supply ; Whatever kind of Ware you bring He buys , and then again each thing You want , 'tis he that can afford All sort of Goods ; yea , in a word , Just as the Heart , Blood forth does send To every Member , then in end It back returns from every part , And once more centers in the Heart . The Merchant so does All supply , And All to him beholden be : And unto him returns All , The Heart we justly may him call The Husbandman we may compare To th' labo'ring hand , that does with care For the whole Body Food provide , And soforth every Trade beside , May be compar'd to Fingers , Toes , And Ankles , Butocks , Chin , and Nose . Among the Crowd then let us [ ? ] ind What place to Tailors is assign'd ; The hinder-part or Bum , we judge The fittest place for them to lodge , For since th' are much possessed with Fear , 'Tis proper they draw to the Rear ; But there's another cause also For which their Post should be so low ; For scarce there is a Trade at all But what of course before them fallen . The Gard'ner Trade in use has been E're Breeks or Aprons first were seen . To work can Tallors well proceed Without their Needles , Sheers , & Thread I hope a Smith must first be had Before such working Tools be made . I judge before he make a Coar A piece of Cloth must first be god ; The Webster , Waker , and the Dyer Above the Tailors must aspire ? And Wrights , and Masons that do dress The Wake-mill , and the Dyer's Press Mus [ tO ] all employed be before The Taylor's Feet needs file your floor With sevral other Tradesmen more . The Taylor then you plainly see Is classed in the last degree . Wha [ tO ] other Arguments are us'd , And counts on which the Taylor's [ ? ] Have little weight . Where as he [ ? ] They made fine Work in Sol'mon's [ ? ] We think he other Arts does wrong For doubtless more praise does belong To those , that did them weave and spin , Imbroder , Press , and dress so fine : The Taylor's work is easier far .
