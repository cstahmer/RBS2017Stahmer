A SONG On his Grace the Duke of Marl - borough's happy Return into England ; Which is to be Sung this Day , being Thursday the 23d of January 1707 ; by Mr. Abel in the Tennis-Court . I. FAME thy loudest blast prepair , Sing the Hero's Deeds in War ; Trumpets Sounding , Death Surrounding Glorious fate , and fierce Alarms ; Nature shaking , Dead awaking , Fire his Manly Soul to Arms. II Our fears are all over , the danger is gone , the Die it is Cast , and the Britains have won ; Our Hero's full glory shines out from a far , While in Triumph , he strid's o're the Trophies of War : Cool Wisdom and Thought o're his Councils preside Success too , that Courts him still Fights on his side . III . Britains bold , you Sons of Glory , With fresh wreath's your Temple bind ; You in Heroic story Leave the lagging World behind : And you great shades in battle Slain , Ascend your Native Skies ; Fame gives to th' Immortal Deed What nigar'd Life denys .
