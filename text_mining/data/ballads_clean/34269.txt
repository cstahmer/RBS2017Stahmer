C : Ry. III . a.10 ( 43 ) Who but I quoth FINLAY A NEW SONG Much in Request Sung with it's own proper Tune . THere dwells a Man into this Town , some say they call him Finlay , He is a brisk and able Man O! if I knew but Finlay . His Reputation was so great that him I did seek after ; And when I found him did entreat he'd tryst with me thereafter , Quoth Finlay , if I come to you , give me none of your ill words ; Though I say No , to you at first , be sure that you come forewards . Then promis'd he to come that Night , and my Chamber I was keeping , He chapped gently at the Door ? for fear I had been sleeping , Who's that at my Chamber Door ? and who but I quoth Finlay Lown Carle come no farther , indeed not I quoth Finlay . Who's that at my Bedside , and who but I quoth Finlay , Lown Carle had thee there ; indeed not I quoth Finlay . Of all the Men I ever did see , there's none I love like Finlay , He was both courteous , stout , and free , my Heart's delight is Finlay . FINIS . C : Ry.
