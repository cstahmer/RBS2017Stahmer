A New Ballad of King Edward and Jane Shore . To the Tune of , St. George for England and the Dragon . WHy should we boast of Lais and his Knights ? knowing such Champions , entrapped by Whorish lights , Or why should we speak of Thais curled locks , Or Rodophe that gave so many men the Pox , Read old stories and there you shall find , How Jane Shore , Jane Shore , she pleas'd King Edwards mind . Jane Shore she was for England , Queen Fredrick was for France , Honi soit qui mal y pence . To speak of the Amazons it were too long to tell , And likewise of [ tO ] he Thracian Girls how far they did excel ; Those with Scythian Lads , engag'd in several Fights , And in the brave Venetian Wars , did foil adventurous Knights Marsaline and Julia were vessels wondrous brittle , But Jane Shore , Jane Shore took down King Edwards mettle ; Jane Shore she was , etc Thallestis of Thormydon she was a doubty weight , She conquered Pallas King in the exercise of Nigh Hercules slew the Dragon , whose teeth were all of Brass , Yet he himself became a slave unto the Lydian Lass. The Theban Semule lay with Jove not dreading all his thunder But Jane Shore overcame King Edward although he had her under : Jane Shore she was , etc Hellen of Greece she came of Spartian blood , Agricola and Cressida they were brave Whores and good ; Queen Clytemnestra boldly slew old Arthurs mighty Son , And fair Harcyon pull'd down the strength of Tallamon , Those were the Ladies that caus'd the Trojan Sack , But Jane shore , Jane Shore , she spoil'd King Edwards back . Jane Shore she was , etc For this the ancient Father's did , great Venus deify , Because with her own Father Jove , she feared not to lie , Hence Cupid came who afterwards reveng'd his loving Mother And made kind Biblis do the like with Cornus her own Brother And afterwards the Goddess kept Adonis for reserve , But Jane Shore , Jane Shore , she stretched King Edwards Nerve , Jane Shore she was , etc The Colchean Dame , Maedea her Father did betray , And taught her Lover Jason how the vig [ il ] ant Bull to slay : And after thence convey'd her Father's golden fleece , She with her Lover sail'd away in Argus ship to Greece ; But finding Jason false , she burned his Wife and Court , But Jane Shore , Jane Shore , she shew'd King Edward spor Jane Shore she was , etc Romix of Saxoni , the Welsh state overthrew , Igraeyn of Cornwal , Pendragon did subdue , Queen Quiniver with Arthur fought singly hand to hand In Bed , though afterwards she made horns on his head to stand ; And to Sir Mordred pictish Prince a Paramour became , But Jane Shore , Jane Shore , she made King Edward tame .
