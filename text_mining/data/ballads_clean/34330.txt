Armati Terram exercent semper que recentes , Convictare juvat predas et vivere rapto . Virg. AEned . L.3 . FLush'd with a double Draught of double Strong , A merry Maltman took his Morning Song ; Blithe as the Lark , chants to the rising Morn , Sung to the Praise of Sir John Barlycorn : He views the swelling Steep , and is well pleas'd , The Fount where Sir John Barlycorn's baptiz'd ; Gives him fresh Liquour , since his old is stale , Knowing he'll pay him back in humming Ale ; Surveys his Circuit in its Breadth and Length , And laughs to see him quicken unto Strength : Then to the Kill , his Altar , does retire , Where he , like Cere's Priest , keeps a perpetual Fire ; Upon his Bed of Straw makes him lie snug , And clothes him with a covenanted Rug , The Kirk's Hair-gown , and by that Weed's foretold , He'll prove a lusty Sinner when he's old . Back to the Floor returns , takes a new Broom , And , like a faithful Keeper , sweeps the Room : Toil'd with his Morning Task , lies down to rest , Making a Pillow of his Master's Breast . Scarce has he sunk to downy Sleep , when he Is rous'd from dreaming , by a turning Key , And Voice of Bully from a foreign Land , Come to Sir John , to gage his Stock in Hand : The figur'd Tap flies from Pandoras Box , Worse than the Plague , the Pestilence or Pox , Draws out and English Yard , and at the Length , Measures his Breadth , his Thickness and his Strength ; Stop , stop you English Taylor , Maltman cries , And Reverence my Master where he lies , And English Suit was never on his Back , Naked at Home , Abroad he wears a Sack . WORSER --- n your Blood B --- r Scot , quoth English Tom , ( Who was and honest Highwayman at Home ) I'm Servant to old England , and be Gad , We'll gage Sir John , and starve him out of Trade ; We'll levy Taxes by a pow'rful Host , Go you complain unto Belhaven's Ghost . May neither Oats or Oxen grace your Ground , Or Plants , or Eatables with you be found ; May Lice and Mange suck and corrupt your Blood , And you , unfed , yourself be Vermine's Food , Till you heard English Hogs , thro' Want of Bred , And nought , save English Laws , be read benorth the Tweed .

Three Times he knock'd his Heart , which sun [ ? ] And thrice the Scoop he flourish'd round his Hea [ ? ] Kicking the Besom , round the Floor he ran , And threw a Firlot at the Gaging-man , While Peets , like Hailstones , flew upon his Hid [ e , ] Cried , WORSER --- l steep you English Rogues in Cly [ de . ] And when you've god Sufficient of the Steep , A Last of WORSER --- ls rot you in the Heap , And work you thro' their Floor with hellish S [ ? ] Then dry you on their ever-burning Kill : Six Times he groan'd , and fell upon Sir John , Said , Oh my dear dead Master , art thou gone ?
