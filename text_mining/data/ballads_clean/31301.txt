Had awa' , bide awa' , Had awa' frae me , Donald ; I'll neither kiss nor hae a ring , Nae tartan plaids for me , Donald . O see you not her ponny progues , Her fecket played , plew , creen , Mattam ? Her twa short hose , and her twa spiogs , And a shoulter-pelt apoon , Mattam ? Had awa' bide awa' , Had awa' frae me , Donald ; Nae shoulder-belts nae trinkabouts , Nae tartan hose for me , Donald . Hur can pe shaw a better hough Tan him wha wears the crown , mattam ; Herself hae pistol and claymore Ta fly ta lallant loun , Mattam . Had awa' , had awa' , Had awa' frae me , Donald ; For a' your houghs and warlike arms , Your no a match for me , Donald .

Had awa' , had awa' , Had awa' frae me , Donald ; I winna quite my morning's tea , Your whey will ne'er agree , Donald . Haper Gallic ye's be learn , And tats ta ponny speak , Mattam ; Ye's get a cheese and putter-kirn Come wi' me gin you like , Mattam ; Had awa' , had awa' , Had awa' frae me , Donald ; Your Gallic and your Highland cheer Will ne'er gae down with me , Donald . Fait ye's pe ket a silder brotch Pe pigger as the moon , Mattam : Ye's ride in curroch stead o' coach , And wow put ye'll pe fine , Martam . Had awa' , had awa' , Had awa' frae me , Donald ; For a' your Highland rarities You're not a match for me , Donald . What's this ta way tat ye'll pe kind To a protty man like me , Mattam ? Sae langs claymore pe po my side , I'll nefer marry tee , Mattam . O come awa' , run awa' , Oh come awa' wi' me , Donald ; I wadna quite my Highland man ; Frae Lallands set me free , Donald . The Surprise I Had a horse and I had nae mair , I got him frae my daddy ; My purse was light and my heart was fair But my wit it was fu' ready . And sae I thought upon a wile , Outwittens of my daddy , To see mysell to a lowland laird , Who had a bonny lady . I wrote a letter , and thus began , Madam , be not offended , I'm o'er the lug's in love wi' you , And care nae tho' you kenned it . For I get little frae the laird , And far less frae my daddy , And I would blythly be the man Would strive to please my lady . She read my letter , and she leuch . the needna been sae blate , man : You might hae come to me yoursell , And tald me o' your state , man : You might hae come to me yoursell , Outwittens of your daddy , And made John Goukston of the laird , And kiss'd his bonny lady . Then she pat siller in my purse , We drank wine in a cogie ; She fee'd a man to rub my horse , And wow but I was vogie : But I got ne'er sae fair a fleg Since I came frae my daddy , The laird came rap rap to the yate , When I was wi' his lady . Then she pat me below a chair , And hap'd me wi' a plaidie ; But I was like to swarf wi' fear , And wish'd me wi' my daddy . The laird went out , he saw na me , I went when I was ready : I promis'd but I ne'er gaed back To see his bonny lady . Whistle o'er the lave o't MY mither sent me to the well , She had better gaen herself , I god the thing I dare nae tell , Whistle o'er the lave o't , My mither sent me to the sea , For to gather musles three ; A sailor lad fell in wi' me , Whistle o'er the lave o't .
