Princely Diversion , or the Jovial Hunting Match , ONE Valentine's Day in the Morning , bright Phoebus began to appear , Sir William Cook winding his Horn And was going a hunting the hare , Says Handford uncouple our Beagles , And let them go questing along For lose her or win her , we must go to dinner Or else they will think me long , Says Handford i pray now forbore si [ r ] And talk not of Dinner so soon For i've not been a hunting this Year And how can you give over by Noon Black Sloven shall warm your bay Robin And make him go Smoacking along , Bonny Dick shall nor Gallop so quick If we light of a Hare that is strong , Well Handford said the good Esquire , I mean to show you a trick I valve not hedges nor Ditches But I'll let you know bonny Dick Then high for the Closom-Bow-Field , We shall get her Ten thousand to one , There's Wonder , lays hard upon Thunder Away , o'er away she is gone . The Morning was pleasant all over So bright and so clear was the Sky , We made all the Woods for to roar , With the Noise of our sweet harmony , It was for the space of three Hours We held all our Horses to speed Black sloven held hard to bay Robin But Yet could not do the deed , It was about Nine in the morning We sounded our first passing Bell sir William pray put up your horn For another Fresh Hare will do well Well Handford said the good Esquire What think you of my bonny Dick doe's think thou can make him to tire or not for to Gallop so quick , Faith Master I needs must Confess , That i fear i was boasting to soon But high for another fresh Hare And your Dick should have dinn'd by noon Well Handford have at your black sloven I'll make him in Purple to Ride And if he does offer to tire I'll certainly Liquour your hide You serve him right well says Jack Wilson for he has taunting at me I never was beatrice in the field so for a fresh a Hare let us see for here is some Closes of Corn see well [ l ] at your place e'ery one Then Master pray pull out your horn , for away , o'er away , she is gone Young Blue b [ e ] ll he cry'd is before And she cry'd it all over the Lane And after her 12 Couple more thus they rattl'd it over the Plain Bonny Dick play'd with his Bridle , And went at a desperate rate Come Handford Pox take you you're idle Must i open you the Gate Oh , your humble Servant good Master , But I will not die in your debt You shall find black sloven go faster for now he begins for to sweet Thrers Wonder and thunder and dido .
