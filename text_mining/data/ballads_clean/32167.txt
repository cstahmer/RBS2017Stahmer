H : 11074 A Description of a Great Sea-Storm , That happened to some Ships in the Gulf of FLORIDA , in September last ; Drawn up by one of the Company , and sent to his Friend at London . THE PREFACE . THe blustering Winds are hushed into a Calm ; No Air stirs now , but what my Muse Embalm'd , Breathes forth to thee , dear Friend ; Heaven smiles upon My Paper , and the Sea turns Helicon ; The Mermaids Muses all , the Sea-Nymphs , bring Aid to my Genius , while to thee I Sing Of Storms , Gusts , Tempests , if compar'd to these , Bermoodus Winds are but a Gentle Breeze ; And to express them fully , I [ am ] feign To raise in Verse a kind of Hurrycane . THE STORME . NOthing but Air and Water is in sighed ; ( I am no Poet here , since Truth I wright . ) When Eolus with his Iron whistle Rouzes The blustering breathings from their Airy houses , Which like to Libertines let lose , will know No Law to guide them , but begin to blow The Sea to swell her teaming Womb , brings forth Wave after wave , and each of greater birth : Waves grow to Surges , Surges Billows turn ; The Ocean is all Timpany , the Urn Of water is a brimmer ; Neptune drinks So full a Cup it overruns the brinks . To Amphetrites Health , the proud waves dash At Heaven as though its Cloudy Face t'would wash : Or sure the lower Water now was bent To mix with that above the Firmament ; Or the cold Element did go about To put the Element of Fire out . Our Ship now under water seems to sail Like to a drowned tossed in John Cook's Ale . The Sea rolled up in Mountains : O! 'tis such Your Cottsall-Hill's a Wart , if't be so much , Which fallen again into such hollow Vales I thought I'de crossed the Sea by Land over Wales ; And then to add Confusion to the Seas , The Sailors speak such Babel words as these : Hale in main Bowlin , Mizzen tack aboard ; A Language , like a Storm , to be abhorr'd : I know not which was loudest , their rude Tongues , Or the Big Winds with her whole Cards of Lungs . So hideous was the Noise , that one might well Fancy himself to be with Souls in Hell ; But that the Torments differ , those Souls are With Fire punished , we with Water here . Our Helm that should our Swimming-Colledge sway , We lash't it up , lest it should run away . Have you a Hedge seen hung with Beggars Fleeces ? So hung our tattered Mainsail down in pieces . Our Tackling crack't as if it had been made To string some Fiddle , not the Seamans Trade . While her own Knell the Seasick Vessel Rings , In breaking of her Ropes , the Ships Heartstrings , As to repent , but never to amend ; So we pumped th' Ship , even to as little end ; For all the water we pumped out with pain , The Sea returns with scorn , and more again . The Guns we carry'd to be our Defence , Heaven thunder'd so , it almost scar'd them thence ; And yet to Heaven for this give thanks we may , But for it's Lightning we had had no Day . The dropy Clouds drinking Salt water sick , Did spew it down upon our Heads so thick ; That betwixt the low'r and upper Seas that fell , Our Ship a Vessel seem'd , and we Mackrell . Pickl'd in Brine , and in our Cabins lie Soused up for Lasting Immortality . The Fear of being drowned , made us wish Our selves transpeciated into Fish . Indeed this Fear did so possess each one , All look't like Shotten-Herring , or Poor-John : Nay of our Saving , there was so much doubt , The Master's Faith begun to tack about ; And had he perish't in this doubtful Fit , His Conscience sure ( with his own Ship ) had split . For which way into Heaven could his Soul Steer , Starboard or Larboard that still cries , No near ? But we were in great Danger , you will say , If Seamen once begin to Kneel , and Pray ; What Holy Church ne're could , Rough Seas have done , Made Seamen buckle to Devotion , And force from them their Letany , while thus They whimper out , Good Lord deliver us ! So pray I too , good Lord deliver thee , Dear Friend , from being taught to Pray at Sea. Be wise , and keep the Shore then , since you may Go in by Land to your VIRGINIA .
