A new Ballad of Robin Hood , William Scadlock , and Little John : OR , A Narrative of their Victory obtained against the Prince of Aragon and the two Giants : And how William Scadlock married the Princess . To the Tune of , Robin Hood , or , Heigh down , down a down . N Owe Robin Hood , Will Scadlock , and little John , are walking over the plain , With a good fat buck which Wiliam Scadlock with his strong bow had stain . Jog on , jog on , cries Robin Hood , the day it runs full fast , For though my Nephew me a breakfast gave , I have not yet broke my fast . Then to yender lodge , let us take our way , I think it wondrous good , Where my Nephew by my bold Yeomen , shall be welcomed unto the green wood . With that he took the bugle-horn , full well he could it blow : Straight from the woods came marching down one hundred tall fellows and more . Stand , stand to your arms , cries Will . Scadlock , lo the enemies are within ken : With that Robin Hood he laughed aloud , cries , They are my bold Yeomen . Who when they arrived , and Robin espied , cried . Master , What is your will : We thought you had in danger been , your horn did found so shrill . Now nay , now nay , quoth Robin Hood , the danger is past and gone , I should have you to welcome my Nephew here , that hath paid me two for one . In feasting and sporting they passed the day , till Phoebus sunk into the deep ; Then each one to his quarters hied , his guard there for to keep . Long had they not walked within the green wood , but Robin he was espied , Of a beautiful Damsel all a lone , that on a black paifrey did ride . Her riding-suit was of sable hew black , cypress over her face , Through which her roselike cheeks did blush all with a comely grace . Come tell me the cause thou pretty one , quoth Robin , and tell me aright , From whence thou comest , and whither thou goest , all in this mournful plighted ? From London I came , the Damsel replied , from London upon the Thames , Which circled is , Oh grief to tell , besieged with foreign arms : By the proud Prince of Aragon , who swears by his martial hand , To have the Princess to his Spouse , or else to waste this Land. Except that Champions can be found , that dare fight three to three , Against the Prince , and Giants twain , most horid for to see : Whose grissly looks , and eyes like brands , strike terror where they come , With serpents hissing on their helms , instead of feathered plume . The Princess shall be the Victor's prize , the King hath vowed , and said , And he that shall the conquest win , shall have her to his Bride . Now we are four Damsels sent abroad , to the East , West , North , and South , To try whose fortune is so good , to find these Champions forth . But all in vain we have sought about , yet none so bold there are , That dare adventure life and blood , to free a Lady fair . When is the day ? quoth Robin Hood , tell me this , and no more . On Midsummer next , the Damsel said , which is June the twenty four . With that the tears trickled down her cheeks , and silent was her tongue , With sighs and sobs she took her leave , away her palfrey sprung . This news struck Robin to the heart , he fell down on the grass , His actium , and his troubled mind , showed he perplexed was . Where lies your grief ? quoth Will scadlock , Oh Master tell to me , If the Damsel's eyes have pierced your heart , I'll fetch her back to thee . Now nay , now nay , quoth Robin Hood , she does not cause my smart , But it is the poor distressed Princess , that wounds me to the heartr . I will go fight the Giants all , to set the Lady free . The Devil take my soul , quoth little John , if I part with thy company . Must I stay behind ? quoth Will . Scadlock , no , no , that must not be , I'll make the third man in the fight , so we shall be three to three . These words cheered Robin at the heart , joy shone within his face , Within his arms he huged them both , and kindly did embrace . Quoth he , We'll put on mothly grey , with long staves in our hands , A scrip and bottle by our sides , as come from the holy Land : So may we pass along the highway , none will ask from whence we came , But take us Pilgrim's for to be , or else some holy-men . Now they are on their journey gone , as fast as they may speed , Yet for all haste , ever they arrived , the Princess forth was led , To be delivered to the Prince , who in the List do stand , Prepared to fight , or else receive his Lady by the hand . With that he walks about the Lists , with Giants by his side , Bring forth , quoth he , your Champions , or bring me forth my Bride : This is the four and twenty day , the day prefixed upon , Bring forth my Bride , London burns , I swear by Acaron . Then cries the King and Queen likewise , both weeping as they speak , Lo we have brought our Daughter dear , whom we are forced to forsake . With that stepped out bold Robin Hood , cries , My Liege it must not be so ; Such beauty as the fair Princess , is not for a Tyrant's mow . The Prince he then began to storm , cries , Fool , fanatic , baboon , How dares thou stop my valour's prize ? I'll kill thee with a frown . Thou Tyrant , Turk , thou Infidel , thus Robin began to reply , Thy frowns I scorn , lo here's my gage , and thus I thee defy : And for those two Goliath's there , that stand on either side , Here are two little Davids by , that soon can tame their pride . Then did the King for armour send , for lances , swords , and shields ; And thus all three in armour bright , came marching to the field . The trumpets began to found a charge , each singled out his man , Their arms in pieces soon where hewed , blood sprung from every vain ; The Prince he reached Robin a blow , he struck with might and main , Which forced him fell about the field , as though he had been slave . God-a-mercy , quoth Robin , for that blow , the quarrel shall soon be tried This stroke shall show a full divorce , betwixt thee and thy Bride . So from his shoulder hes cut his head , which on the ground did fallen , And grumbled soar at Robin Hood , to be so dealt withal . The Giants then began to rage , to see their Prince lie dead ; Thou's be the next , quoth little John , except thou well guard thy head : With that his faulcion he wherled about , it was both keen and sharp , He clove the Giant to the belt , and cut in twain his heart . Will . Scadlock well had played his part , the Giant he brought to his knee , Quoth he , The Devil cannot break his fast , unless he have you all three : So with his faulcion he run him through , a deep and gashly wound , Who rambed and foamed , cursed & amp ; blasphemed , and then fell to the ground . Now all the Lists with sheets were filled , the skies they did resound , Which brought the Princess to herself , who was fallen in a swoon . The King , and Queen , and Princess fair , came walking to the place , And gave the champions many thanks , and did them further grace . Tell me , quoth the King , whence you are , that thus disguised came , Whose valour speaks , that noble blood , does run through every vain ? A boon , a boon , quoth Robin Hood , on my knees I beg and crave . By my crown , quoth the King , I grant , ask what , and thou shalt have . Then pardon I beg for my merry men , which are within the green wood , For little John , and Will . Scadlock , and for me bold Robin Hood . Art thou Robin Hood then ? quoth the King , for the valour you have shown , Your pardons I do freely grant , and welcome every one . The Princess I promised the Victor's prize , she cannot have you all three : She shall choose , quoth Robin ; says little John , Then little share falls to me . Then did the Princess view all three , with a comely lovely grace , Who took Will Scadlock by the hand , quoth , Here I make my choice . With that a noble Lord stepped forth , of Maxfield Earl was he , Who looked Will Scadlock in the face , then wept most bitterly : Quoth he , I had a son like thee , whom I loved wondrous well , But he his gone , or rather dead , his name is young Gamwell . Then did Will Scadlock fallen on his knees , cries , Father , father here , Here kneels your son , your young Gamwell , you said you loved so dear . But Lord what embracing , and kissing was there , when all these friends where met , They are gone to the wedding and so the bedding , and so I bid you goodnight . FINIS LONDON : Printed for A .
