( 1 ) STANZA'S . To my Lady SUNDERLAND AT TUNBRIDGE-WELLS . 1712. FAIR Nymph , ascend to Beauty's Throne , And Rule that radiant World alone : Let Favourites take thy Lower Sphere , Not Monarchs are thy Rivals here . The Court of Beauty built Sublime , Defies all Pow'rs but Heav'n and Time : Envy that clouds the Hero's Sky Aims but in vain her Spite so high . Not Bleinheim's Field , nor Ister's Flood , Nor Standards dy'd in Gallic Blood : Torn from the Foe add nobler Grace To CHURCHILL's House than SPENCER's Raze . The The Warlike Thunder of his Arms Is less Commanding than Her Charms ; His Lightning strikes with less Surprise , Than sudden Glances from Her Eyes . His Captives feel their Limbs confin'd In Iron ; She enslaves the Mind ; We follow with a pleasing Pain , And Bless the Conqueror and the Chain . The Muse that dares in Numbers do What Paint and Pencils never knew ; Faints at Her Presence in Despair , And owns th' Inimitable FAIR . FINIS . LONDON : Printed for E. Curll at the Dial and Bible against St. Dunstan's Church in Fleetstreet , and Sold at his Shop on Tunbridge-Walks . 1712. Price 2 worser . ( 1 ) STANZA'S .
