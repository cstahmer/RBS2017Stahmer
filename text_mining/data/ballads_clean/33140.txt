A Letter for a Christian Family . Directed to all true Christians to read . [ Which ] being sealed up in heart and mind , [ Nothing ] g but truth in it you'l find , [ Both O ] ld and Young , both Rich and Poor , [ Bear it ] in mind , keep it in store : [ And th ] ink upon the time to come , For time does pass , the Glass does run , Therefore while thou hast time and space , Call to the Lord above for Grace . Then he will surely thee defend , And thou shalt make a happy end . To the Tune of , The Godly men Instruction . [ Bot ] h young and old , both rich and poor give ear , [ Un ] to these verses which I shall declare , [ And gi ] we good heed to that which here is pen'd , [ And str ] ive in time your wicked lives to mend . [ But you ] tO there's many that does not regard , [ Till fo ] r their sins they have a just reward : [ But still ] l goes on , their wicked courses run , [ Until ] both Soul and Body be undone . [ Theref ] over good people let us have a care , [ And u ] unto Christ with speed let us repair ; [ Leave ] off your sins which now do so abound , [ For 'tw ] as for since that once the world was drown'd . [ How m ] any sins within this Land we see ? [ In high ] and low of every degree ; [ Both ri ] changed and poor they now do live at strife [ And gr ] eat debate is betwixt man and wife . [ Broth ] r and Sister they do disagree , [ As by exp ] erience now we daily see : And children that have hardly use of Tongue , Will Swear and Curse as they do pass along . And some will Curse their Parents to their face , Methinks to them it is a foul disgrace , But 'tis forbidden in the Laws of God , Therefore let's serve him all with one accord . The since of pride we see does so excel , In Men and Women now the truth to tell : And for that since we read that Satan fell , From and high Angel to a Devil in hell . Also we read of Dives pomp and state , And of poor Lazarus that lay at his gate , In Abrahams bosom he was nourished , And with sweet comforts he was daily fed . While Dives for one drop did call and cry , To cool his Tongue , he did in torments lie , But any comfort could he not receive , Because poor Lazarus he would not relieve . IN fashions strange and many a found delight , We please our fancies now both Day & Night , And never think upon this time to come , Although our Glass hath but one hour to run . There's many now that to the Church do go , Their pomp and pride , and bravery to show , More than to hear the sacred word of God , But let all such beware his heavy Rod . Be not too covetous in heart and mind , Nor to that since be not too much inclin'd : Remember Judas how he was too hold , For covetousness his Lord and Master sold . Be not too prudent in this thy worldly wealth , Do not trust to it , for it is but pelf , 'Twill fade away and leave thee in the dust , From thence thou cam'st , and thither return thou must Lord give us grace to understand aright , Thy holy laws and therein take delight ; And comfort those the which are comfortless , And help the Widow in her great distress . Likewise the Fatherless Oh Lord defend , And thy true grace unto all Christians send : And grant that we thy holy name may fear , And serve thee still with heart most pure and clear . How many Messengers the Lord hath sent , To give us warning that we should repent , But yet our hearts so stubborn are I say , That we God's holy word will not obey . Sermons on Sermons we do daily hear , By Ministers well learn'd as does appear , To give us warning to repent our since , Which we so long time now have lived in . All you that read these lines which hear are pen'd , Observe them well and strive your lives to mend , For time does slide , and swiftly pass away , One hour or minute for no man will stay . Our time which in this world we have to spend , In prayers and tears unto the Lord let's send , For to defend us from all Satans power , That seeks our Souls and Bodies to devour . Now to conclude , the God of peace and love , Grant that our Souls may dwell in Heaven above : And grant our King & Queen a prosperous reign , The Gospel pure among us to maintain . By me J.V.
