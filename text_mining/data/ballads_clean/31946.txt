O my Dearest come away , and harken what thy love does say As I am here I vow and swear I kindly will embrace thee ; Thou need not fear my only dear that I shall e'er disgrace thee . I'le be as honest as the day , thy virtues I will not bewray , No face alive shall e're dep [ r ] ive me of my dearest jewel , If thou deny I sure shall die , then be not thou so cruel . many years I loved thee , therefore dearest pity me , Thy very frown does cast me down , thy smiles again revive me : Thou hast my heart where'r thou art then don't of love deprive me . Maid . O fie thou simple Prentice boy , how durst thou with me tick & toy ? Or he so bold this to unfold unto thy masts Daughter ? If he should know , 'twould breed thy woe then what will follow after . I am my Father's own delight This you may understand aright , No Daughter he hath else but me , which makes him highly prize me ; Therefore be mute , leave off thy suit I friendly do advice thee . My Father's anger pray you shun , lest you are utterly undone , The prison-grate will be your fate , if you run such adventures , Beside all this , if maids you kiss you forfeit your indentures . Man. Prithee dearest do not flout , At Easter next my time is out , And then I swear I will not care for master nor such Histories : But a wife i'le have my life to sa [ v ] e , and you'r my only mistress . Blame me not for sa [ y ] ing so , For love will creep [ w ] here it cannot go Had I not spoke , my heart had broke I could endure no longer : Though I did fight both day & night yet Cupid grew the stronger . Methinks I see thy lovely face As I do walk in any place , Thy crystal eyes where Cupid lies , thy cheeks are like to Roses : Thy lips are sweet , when as we meet all virtue there incloses . Though I am poor and thou art rich Slight me not I thee beseech , You know my trade will keep a maid as well as yeoman Jarvis , If I get Pearl my dearest Girl , it shall be at thy service . Maid . Thy speeches I do much commend , Yet dare I not to condescend For fear I loose as I sup [ p ] ose , my father's dear affection . Or el [ s ] e i'd yield to you the field , if I might have my election . Man. Never stand to compliment , This does give me no c [ oh ] ntent , Tho' father frown & mother f [ r ] own , yet none of them shall rout me , I am not in jest I do p [ r ] otest I cannot live without thee . Thus he gain'd the Dams [ e ] ls love , And honest to her he did prove , He wedded her and bed [ e ] worser her although his Master's Daughter ; He pleas'd her well [ th ] e truth to tell , and parents love came after . For they gave them e [ i ] ghtsc [ oh ] re pound whereby this coup [ l ] es j [ oh ] is were crowned Thus may you see in each d [ e ] gree this youth was well be [ f ] r [ i ] end [ e ] worser , They live in peace , their goods increase and thus my Song is ended .
