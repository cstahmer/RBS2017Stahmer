To the Tune of the Soldiers delight . Licensed and Entered according to Order . WHen first this Couple fell in Love A bargain she did make Sir , That when as he had need of her , She would not him forsake Sir , And so they went for two Comrades , Most lovingly Together And played their parts actively Like two Birds of a Feather She marched with him in wet and dry Her Husband was a Musketeer , And she a famous Drummer , etc For she was Daintily Bedect , According to her Colour , And she was like indeed , Just to great Mars's Fellow She marched , etc She had god men Apparel on Gay Doublet and brave hose Sir , And lastly she bet a Drum , Her Enemies to appose Sir , When Canons Roar and bullets flies As thick as hail from Sky Sir , She never feared her foreign foes , When her Comrades was nigh Sir She stood the brunt in heat and dry , In Winter and in Summer , etc In every plain where she did go , She showed herself so valiant There's few men might compare with her Her actions were so gallant She manage could a sword full well And to advance a Pike Sir , And for the beating of a Drum You seldom herd the like Sir In frost and Snow in wet and dry In Winter and in Summer , etc She bet with three Man at one time And wone of them a wager Had not one strange chance befallen She had been made Drum Major , Her belly it began to swell And she grew plump and jolly , And she used all the means she could , All for to hide her Belly [ ? ] ed him in wet and dry [ ? ] and in Summer , etc Near Towerhill she quartered was In famous London City , And more strange News I have to tell , For she was grown so big with Child , Which made her Fellows wonder , And in a Small time after that , Poor Soul she fell a Sunder , etc But when her painful hour appeared , I do not Lie nor Flatter , The Woman cut her Codpis points , To see what was the matter , She marched with him in wet and dry , In Winter and in Summer , etc But to be brief it came to pass , As I must tell you truly , She was delivered of a Son , The 16th day of July , The women all was kind to her , While that she was in Labour , They furnished her with everything , As Meat and Drink and Clothing , Her Child's Linen and the Like , They let her want for nothing , Her Husband was a Musketeer , And she a Famaous Drummer , And it seems they played their business well In Winter and in Summer , etc Let no men , no , no women think , That she hath been dishonest , But what she did was done in love , As she before had promised , To keep her Husbands Company , The truth of all was so Sir , And pleasure him both day and Night , Where ever she did go Sir , For her Husband was a Musketeer , And she a Famous Drummer , But it seems they played their business well , In Winter and in Summer , etc Fair Maidens all that hear this Song , Consider what is told here , Concerning of a woman kind , That dearly loved a Soldier , If you with Soldiers be in Love I wish you to prove loyal , For they to you will constant prove .
