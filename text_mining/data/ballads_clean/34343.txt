C : Ry. III . a.10 ( 111 ) The Apparition . AT Midnight Hours , when Nature seems to nod , And Sleep triumphs upon the Works of God , Tormented Souls awake , and Spirits fly abroad , Appear'd , with smiling Face , a Female's Ghost , By Falsehood to Elisium Shades was tossed , And thus harangu'd a Monster of a Man , While Horror shook his Limbs and thro' his Pulses ran , My Sins forgiven , now Glory swells my Breast , I answer'd for your Bill , and Jesus for the rest . My Joy begins , and your eternal Woe , For I'm absolv'd above , as you below , Where Truth and Justice reign , without a Flaw , No Falsehood there , nor sneaking Tricks of Law , In Doomsday's Books your Name hath god a Mark , And every Angel was a Divine Clerk . Receive this Rope resign'd me from the Tree , And mourn and melt when you remember me . Edinburgh , Printed by James Ross. C : Ry. III . a.10 ( 111 ) The Apparition .
