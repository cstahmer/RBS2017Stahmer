Fair Margaret's Misfortunes ; OR , Sweet William's Dream on his Wedding Night With the sudden Death and Burial of those noble Lovers . AS it fell out upon a day , Two lovers they set on a hill ; They set together a long summer's day , And could not take their fill . I see no harm by you Margaret , And you see none by me ; Before tomorrow at eight o'clock A rich wedding you shall see . Fair Margaret set in her bower window , A combing of her hair ; And there she espy'd Sweet William and bride , As they were a riding near . Down she laid her ivory comb , And up she bound her hair ; She went away forth from the bower , But never more came there . When day was gone , and night was come And all men fast asleep , There came the spirit of fair Margaret , And stood at William's bed-feet . God give you Joy you true lovers , In bridebed fast asleep ; Lo ! I am going to my green-grass Grove , And I am in my winding-sheet . When day was come , and night was gone And all men wak'd from sleep ; Sweet William to his Lady said , My dear I've cause to weep . I dream'd a dream , my dear lady , Such dreams are never good ; I dream'd thy bower was full of read swine And my bridebed full of blood . Such dreams , such dreams my honour-ed Sir , They never do prove good ; To dream thy bower was full of swine , And thy bridebed full of blood . He called his merry men all , By one , by two , and by three ; Saying , I'll away to Fair Margaret's Bower , By the leave of my Lady . And when he came to Fair Margaret's Bower , He knocked at the ring ; So ready were her Seven Brothers To let Sweet William in . The he turn'd up the covering sheet , Pray let me see the dead , Methinks she looks both pale and van , She has lost her cherry read . I'll do no more for thee Margaret , Than any of thy kin ; For I will kiss thy pale van lips , Tho' a smile I cannot win . With that bespoke the seven brothers , Making most piteous moan , You may go kiss your jolly brown dame , And let our sister alone . If I do kiss my jolly brown dame , I do but what is right ; For I made no vow to your sister dear , By day nor yet by night . Pray tell me then how much you'll deal , Of white bred and your wine ? So much as is dealt at her Funeral Today , To morrow shall be dealt at mine . Fair Margaret dy'd Today , Today , Sweet William he dy'd the morrow ; Fair Margaret dy'd for pure truelove , Sweet William he dy'd for sorrow . Margaret was bury'd in the Lower Chancel , And William in the higher ; Out of her breast there sprang a Rose , And out of his a briar . They grew as high as the church top , 'Till they could grow no higher ; And there they grew in a True Lover's Knot , That made all people admire . Then came the clerk of the parish , As you this truth shall hear , And by misfortune cut them down , Or they had now been there . Printed and Sold in Aldermary Church - Yard , Bow-Lane , London .

A Song in Praise of the Leather Bottle . GOD above that made all Things , The Heaven and Earth , and all therein , The Ships that on the Sea do swim , For to keep the Enemies out , that none come in ; And let them all doe what they can , It is for the use and praise of Men . And I wish in Heaven his Soul may dwell , Who first devis'd the Leather Bottle . Then what do you say to those cans of Wood ? In faith they are not , and cannot be good ; For when a Man he does them send , For to be fill'd with Ale , he does intend , The Bearer falls down by the Way , And on the Ground the Liquour does lie . And then the Bearer begins to ban , And swears its along of the wooden Can ; But had it been a Leather Bottle , Altho' it had fallen , yet all had been well . And I wish , etc Then what do you say to these Glasses fine ? Yet they shall have no praise of mine : For when in a Company they are set , For to be merry as we are met ; But if you chance to touch the brim , Down falls the Liquour , and all therein . If your Table-Cloth be ever so fine , Down lies your Beer , Ale , or Wine ; It may be for a small Abuse , A young Man may his service loose ; But had it been the Leather Bottle , And the Staple in , then all had been well . And I wish , etc Then what do you say to these black Pots three ? Why they shall have no Praise from me ; For when a man and his wife falls at strife , ( As many have done I have known in my life ) They lay their hand on the Pot both , And loath they are to spill the broth ; The one does tug , the other does ill , Betwixt them both the Liquour they spill ; But they shall answer another day , For casting the Liquour so vainly away ; But had it been in the Leather Bottle , They might have tugg'd till their hearts did ache , And yet the Liquour no harm could take , And I wish , etc Then what do you say to these silver Flaggons fine ? Why , they shall have no Praise of mine ; For when a Lord he does them send , For to be fill'd with Wine as he does intend , The Man with his Flagon runs away , Because it is Silver so gallant and gay , Oh then the Lord begins to ban , And swears he has lost both Flagon and Man ; There's never a Lord , Serving-Man , or Groom , But with his Leather Bottle will come , Then I wish , etc A Leather Bottle we know is good , Far better than Glasses , or Cans of Wood ; For when a Man is at work in the field , Your Glasses and Pots not comfort will yield , But a good Leather Bottle standing him by . He may drink always when he is dry ; It will revive his spirits and comfort his brain , Wherefore let none this Bottle refrain . For I wish , etc And so the honest Scytheman too , He knew not very well for to do , But for his Bottle standing him near , Which is filled with good household Beer , At Dinner he sits him down to eat , With good hard cheese , and bred or meat , Then his Bottle he takes up amain , And drinks , and sits it down again ; Saying , Good Bottle stand my friend , And hold till this Day does end . For I wish , etc And likewise the Haymakers they , When as they were turning and making their hay , In Summer Weather , when it is warm , A good Bottle full will do us no harm : And at noontime when they set them down , For to drink of their Bottle and Ale so brown : When the Lads and the Lasses begin to tattle , What should we do but for the Leather Bottle ? For they could not work if the Bottle was done , Since the Day is so hight with the heat of the Sun. Then I wish , etc Also the Leader , Loader , and Pitcher , The Reaper , Hedger , and the Ditcher , The Binder , and the Raker , and all , About the Bottle's ears do fallen : And if the Liquour be almost gone , His Bottle he will patr with to none ; But says , My Bottle is but small , One Drop I will not part withal ; You must go drink at some spring or Well , For I will keep my Leather Bottle . Then I wish , etc Thus you may hear of a Leather Bottle , When it is fill'd with good Liquour well , Altho' the substance be but small , Yet the Name of it is all in all ; For there's never a Lord , a Duke , nor Knight , But in a Bottle does take great delight ; For when he is hunting of the Deer , He often does wish for a Bottle of Beer ; Likewise the man that works io the Wood , A Bottle of Beer does oft do him good . Then I wish , etc Then when this Bottle does grow old , And will no longer good Liquour hold , Out of the side you may take a Clout , Will mend your shoes when they are worn out ; Else take it and hang it upon a pin , It will serve to put odd trifles in , As Hinges , Awls , and Candle-Ends , For young Beginners must have such Things .

Then I wish , etc Also the Leader , Loader , and Pitcher , The Reaper , Hedger , and the Ditcher , The Binder , and the Raker , and all , About the Bottle's ears do fallen : And if the Liquour be almost gone , His Bottle he will patr with to none ; But says , My Bottle is but small , One Drop I will not part withal ; You must go drink at some spring or Well , For I will keep my Leather Bottle . Then I wish , etc Thus you may hear of a Leather Bottle , When it is fill'd with good Liquour well , Altho' the substance be but small , Yet the Name of it is all in all ; For there's never a Lord , a Duke , nor Knight , But in a Bottle does take great delight ; For when he is hunting of the Deer , He often does wish for a Bottle of Beer ; Likewise the man that works io the Wood , A Bottle of Beer does oft do him good . Then I wish , etc Then when this Bottle does grow old , And will no longer good Liquour hold , Out of the side you may take a Clout , Will mend your shoes when they are worn out ; Else take it and hang it upon a pin , It will serve to put odd trifles in , As Hinges , Awls , and Candle-Ends , For young Beginners must have such Things . Printed and Sold in Aldermary Church - Yard , Bow Lane , London . A Song in Praise of the Leather Bottle . GOD above that made all Things , The Heaven and Earth , and all therein , The Ships that on the Sea do swim , For to keep the Enemies out , that none come in ; And let them all doe what they can , It is for the use and praise of Men . And I wish in Heaven his Soul may dwell , Who first devis'd the Leather Bottle . Then what do you say to those cans of Wood ? In faith they are not , and cannot be good ; For when a Man he does them send , For to be fill'd with Ale , he does intend , The Bearer falls down by the Way , And on the Ground the Liquour does lie . And then the Bearer begins to ban , And swears its along of the wooden Can ; But had it been a Leather Bottle , Altho' it had fallen , yet all had been well . And I wish , etc Then what do you say to these Glasses fine ? Yet they shall have no praise of mine : For when in a Company they are set , For to be merry as we are met ; But if you chance to touch the brim , Down falls the Liquour , and all therein . If your Table-Cloth be ever so fine , Down lies your Beer , Ale , or Wine ; It may be for a small Abuse , A young Man may his service loose ; But had it been the Leather Bottle , And the Staple in , then all had been well . And I wish , etc Then what do you say to these black Pots three ? Why they shall have no Praise from me ; For when a man and his wife falls at strife , ( As many have done I have known in my life ) They lay their hand on the Pot both , And loath they are to spill the broth ; The one does tug , the other does ill , Betwixt them both the Liquour they spill ; But they shall answer another day , For casting the Liquour so vainly away ; But had it been in the Leather Bottle , They might have tugg'd till their hearts did ache , And yet the Liquour no harm could take , And I wish , etc Then what do you say to these silver Flaggons fine ? Why , they shall have no Praise of mine ; For when a Lord he does them send , For to be fill'd with Wine as he does intend , The Man with his Flagon runs away , Because it is Silver so gallant and gay , Oh then the Lord begins to ban , And swears he has lost both Flagon and Man ; There's never a Lord , Serving-Man , or Groom , But with his Leather Bottle will come , Then I wish , etc A Leather Bottle we know is good , Far better than Glasses , or Cans of Wood ; For when a Man is at work in the field , Your Glasses and Pots not comfort will yield , But a good Leather Bottle standing him by . He may drink always when he is dry ; It will revive his spirits and comfort his brain , Wherefore let none this Bottle refrain . For I wish , etc And so the honest Scytheman too , He knew not very well for to do , But for his Bottle standing him near , Which is filled with good household Beer , At Dinner he sits him down to eat , With good hard cheese , and bred or meat , Then his Bottle he takes up amain , And drinks , and sits it down again ; Saying , Good Bottle stand my friend , And hold till this Day does end . For I wish , etc And likewise the Haymakers they , When as they were turning and making their hay , In Summer Weather , when it is warm , A good Bottle full will do us no harm : And at noontime when they set them down , For to drink of their Bottle and Ale so brown : When the Lads and the Lasses begin to tattle , What should we do but for the Leather Bottle ?
