The second part To the same tune . A Dainty spruce Spanyard with hair black as jet , long cloak with round caps , a long Rapier & Poigniard He told her if that she could Scotland forget , hee'd show her the Vines as they grow in the Vineyard . If thou wilt abandon this Country so cold , I'll show thee fair Spaine , and much Indian gold , But still she replied , Sir , I pray let me be . Gif ever I have a man , Blew-cap for me . A haughty high Germane of Hamborough town , a proper tall gallant with mighty moustaches : He weeps if the Lass upon him do but frown , yet hee's a great Fencer that comes to overmatch us . But yet all his fine fencing could not get the Lass , She deny'd him so oft , that he wearied was : For still she replied , Sir , I pray let me be , Give ever I have a man , Blew-cap for me . A Netherland Mariner there came by chance , whose cheeks did resemble two roasting Pomwaters : To this Cany Lass he his suit did advance , and as taught by nature he cunningly flatters : Isk will make thee , said he , sole Lady o'th Sea , Both Spanirds and Englishmen shall thee obey , But still she replied , Sir , I pray let me be , Give ever I have a man , Blew-cap for me . These sundry Suitors of several Lands , did daily solicit this Lass for her favour , And every one of them alike understands that to win the prize they in vain did endeavour . For she had resolved ( as I before said ) To have bonny Blew-cap , or else dee a maid . Unto all her suppliants still replied she , Give ever I have a man , Blew-cap for me . At last came a Scottish man ( with a blew-cap ) and he was the party for whom she had tarry'd To get this blithe bonny Lass 'twas his good hap , they gangd to the Kirk & were presently marry'd . I ken not weel whither it were Lord or Leard , They ca [ u ] de him some [ s ] ike a like name as I herd , To choose him from all , she did gladly agree . And still she cried Blew-cap th' art welcome to me . FINIS . Printed at London for Thomas Lambert .
