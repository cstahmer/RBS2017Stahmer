The Maidens Frolic : OR , A brief Relation how Six Lusty Lasses has Pressed full Fourteen Tailors on the backside of St. Clements , and the other adjacent Places . To the Tune of and Orange . Licensed according to Order . O F late near the Strand we well understand Six Lasses that took a brisk Frolic in hand ; It thus I profess , they in Seaman's Dress , [ N ] ot far from the Maypole resolved to Press Fourteen Tailors . [ Y ] oung Nancy she tied a Sword by her side , [ A ] and she was resolved for to be their Guide : This young Female Crew , Kate , Bridget , & amp ; Prue , And she that went foremost was Lieutenant Sue , Pressing Tailors . These Maids by consent their minds fully bent , First through the back side of St. Clements they went , Where just in the Street they a Taylor did meet , Then Pressed him , and straight he fell down at their feet , I'm a Taylor . I tell you , said he , I never was at Sea , And therefore kind Gentlemen pray set me free , And pity those Tears , I have loved Forty Year , And never used Weapon , but Bodkin and Shears , I'm a Taylor . But Susan and they strait hauled him away , While Tom the poor Taylor did sighs , beg , and pray , Yet all was in vain , for they did him retain , And told him that now he must fight on the Main , Though a Taylor . Then to White-hart-yard they went with regard , And there a poor Taylor was labouring hard Upon his Shopboard , Nan drew out her Sword , Saying , He must King William his Service afford , Though a Taylor . The Taylor did quake , nay , quiver and shake , At length with a pitiful Voice he did spoke , While Tears down did run , he cried I'm undone , I never did know the right end of a Gun , I'm a Taylor . Then stout Boston Bess said nevertheless , You must go with us , we've a Warrant to Press ; Then wave this Excuse , and lay by your Goose , Such nimble young Fellows may be of great use . Though a Taylor . And then by report they went to Round Court , Where Seven young Tailors were making of spo [ rt ] Their Hearts void of Care , though when they come there [ e ] These Maids did catch napping , as Moss catched [ h ? ] [ Ma ? ] Seven Tailors . They thought to resist , but Joan with her Fist , She thumpt them about till the Tailors they Pist And then in a rage , the rest did engage , And brought them away to the Round-House or Cag [ e ] These poor Tailors . With all might and main , down to Duchy-lane , These Petticoats Press-M [ a ] sters hurried again , To Press some they knew , 'twas Morgan and Hug [ h ] A couple belonged to the Crosslegged Crew , And Welsh Tailors . Then Morgan hur rails , cries , Splutter-a-nails , Hur newly come up to fair London from Wales , Then pray cease your Strife , hur has a young Wife Beside hur was never yet killed in hur Life , A Welsh Taylor . But yet right or wrong , they brought they along , And happened to meet with Three more in the Thron [ g ] Then said lusty Jane , you must serve King & amp ; Queen And thus these stout Females did Press full Fourteen And all Tailors .
