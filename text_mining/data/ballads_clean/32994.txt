THE Virtuous Young Maids WISH . To the Tune of the Old men Wish . I . I Am a Young Maid , And Daily am Taught That many Young Women Are turn'd to be Nought . But ne'er let me meet with A Sweet-Heart so Hallow , As to Wheedle me in , Their Footsteps to follow . Tho Friends should forsake me And Beauty decay ; And Riches take their Wings , And quite Fly away ; Let me have a good Name , Until my last Day , Until my -------- last Day . II Let my Master be Civil , Not Hasty nor Proud ; But Real and Honest , Wise , Upright and Good . With a Mistress that's Sober , Both Virtuous and Just ; And I be a Servant , Deserving their Trust. Tho Friends should Forsake me , etc III . With a Bible in Pocket , And Needle in my Hand ; To Answer Discreetly , And be at Cammand . Let ne'er my Intentions A Bad thing design : And still let my Clothes be More fiting than fine . Tho Friends should forsake me , etc IV. With good Table Beer , And Wholesome good Fare , No Painting , or Patching , Nor Curling of Hair : But Grave in Apparel , And sober in Food , I truly may merit A Name that is Good . Tho Friends should forsake me , etc V. And if a Young-Man ( Whom I Love as my Life ) Should Wed me , and make me His Married Wife ; Let us live still Contented , Our Livelihood such As none may Repent it , Not Poor , nor too Rich. Tho Friends should forsake me , etc VI . And when I am Wedded , Let other Maids say And Honest Young Virgin Is Married to Day : When a Girl , she was Modest , When a Maid , she was Chaste , Not Vain , nor Presumptuous , Belov'd of the Best . Tho her Friends should forsake her , Her Beauty Decay ; And Wealth ( like a Vapour ) Should Vanish away , She'l prove a good Woman Until her last Day , Until her --------- last Day .
