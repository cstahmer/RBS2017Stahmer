H : 135872 The Scotch Lasses Constancy : OR , [ J ] ENNY's Lamentation for the Death of JOCKEY . Who for her sake was Unfortunately Kill'd by SAWNY in a Duel . Being a most pleasant Song , to a Delightful New Tune . TWa Bonny Lads were Sawny and Jockey , but Jockey was Lo'd and Sawny unlucky ; Yet Sawny was tall , well-favour'd and witty , But I's in my heart thought Jockey more pretty : For when he view'd me , su'd me , woo'd me , never was Ladd so like to undo me : Fie I cry'd , and almost dy'd , least Jockey wou'd gang and come no mere to me . ( 2 ) [ Joc ] key would Love , but he would not Marry , [ And ] worser I was afraid that I shou'd miscarry ; [ For ] his cunning Tongue with Wit was so guilded , [ That ] at I had a dread my heart wou'd a yielded : [ Dam ] yly he pressed me , blessed me , kissed me , [ Los ] tO was the hour methought when he missed me ; [ Cr ] ying , denying , and sighing , I woo'd him , [ And ] worser much ado I had to get from him . ( 3 ) [ But ] tO unlucky Fate robb'd me of my Jewel , [ For ] Sawny would make him fight in a Duel ; [ That ] en down in a Dale with Cyprus surrounded , [ O ] ! there in my sighed poor Jockey was wounded : [ But ] tO when he thrill'd him , fell'd him , kill'd him , [ Wh ] ho can express my grief that beheld him ? [ Ra ] ging , I tore my Hair to bind him , [ And ] worser vowed and swore I'de ne'r stay behind him . ( 4 ) [ I'se ] shriek'd and I'se cry'd , wae's me so unhappy , [ For ] I'se now have lost mine nene sweet Jockey : [ Sa ] wny I cursed , and bid him to fly me , [ I v ] ow'd and I swore he shou'd ne'r come nigh me , [ But ] tO I'd spite him , hate him , fight him , [ And ] worser never again wou'd Jenny like him : [ That ] ough he did sighs and almost die , [ He ] cry'd fie on me , cause I did slight him . ( 5 ) [ And ] worser from me I'se bid him straightway be ganging , [ W ] hen with arms a cross , and head down hanging : [ W ] hilst that my poor Jockey was a dying , [ He ] to the Woods then departed sighing : [ And ] worser his breath wanted , panted , fainted , [ W ] hilst that for him my tears were not scanted : [ I's ] e beatrice my breast , and my grief expressed , [ W ] ae's me that Death my joy has suppressed . ( 6 ) At which my Jockey a little reviving , And with Death as it were he lay then striving , Open'd his Eyes and looked upon me . And faintly sigh'd , Ah! Death has undone me : Jenny my Honey I'se must part from thee , But when I'm dead , sure there's none will wrong thee , I did love thee , and that did move me To Fight , that so a man I'se might prove me . ( 7 ) But ah cruel Fate to Death I am wounded , Oh! and with that again he then swooned ; While for to dress his wound I apply'd me , But uvae alas his Life was deny'd me : Death had appaul'd him , gaul'd him , thrall'd him , So that he dy'd , with grief I beheld him : And left poor Jenny all a mourning , And cruel Sawny cursing and scorning . ( 8 ) From Jockies cold Lips I often stole Kisses , The which while he lived were still my blisses : A thousand time I did sob , sighs it , And much ado I'se had to be quie For as I ey'd him , spy'd him , ply'd him , Never a thought could then pass beside him : I'se ban the Fates that Life denying , Had robb'd me of Jockey , and long I sat sighing . ( 9 ) Till I'se at last with Cyprus crown'd him , And with my tears I'se almost crown'd him : The Turtles about us then came flying , And mourning , coo'd , to seem a sighing : I'se view'd him , ru'd him , with flowers strew'd him , And with my love to the last pursu'd him : Resolving that I'se not stay behind him , But sighing , die , and seek for to find him .
