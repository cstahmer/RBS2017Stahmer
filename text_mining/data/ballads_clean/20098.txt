A Sorrowful Song [ , ] Made upon the murder and untimely death of Sir Thomas Overbury Knight , w [ ho ] was poisoned in the Tower of London , by the consent and damnable practices of di - vers envious person in this Land. To the tune of Essex good night . TO He saddest tale that ever was told , With sorrowful sobs I here begin , [ Wh ] at trembling fears from young & amp ; old , May fright away so bloody a sin . S [ ir ] Thomas Overbury was he , For whom my heavy heart makes moan : Never was Knight of his degree , By feigned love thus overthrown . In Englands Court he was approved , A wise , a kind , and courteous Knight , Of rich and poor likewise beloved For virtue was his hearts delight . Where since prevailed , his counsels gave Still caveats to his choicest friends , How God would no proceedings have , That aimed not at noble ends , And where he loved he could not hate , But told them still of their amiss : Though personages of noble state , How wanton will dishonour is . Hereat both grudge , and envy lurked Within those hearts to mischief bent , Who being touched , a practice worked , That he to Londons Tower was sent . Yet still suspecting nothing [ le ] sse , Then their best loves to [ h ? ] in deard , With pa [ ti ] ence passed he heaviness [ ? ] And of their falsehood little feared . [ ? ] [ ? ] Prepared they a poison strong , His liberty by death to bring . The which was by one Weston broug [ ht ] A messenger of deadly spite : Unknown ( God wot ) there to have wrou [ ght ] The death of this renowned Knight . But God not suffering [ w ] as [ ? ] n , At first to take his [ ? ] away Another draught was sent again , Impatient of sunch [ l ] ong delay . By Tarts and dishes of repast , With deadly poison saust therein , Desiring still a speedy haste , To finish up this bloody sin . At which he took with thankfulness , A [ s ] dainties from his loving friends : Until at last all comfortless , His gentle life with poison ends , For whom much heavy [ me ? e ] was m [ ? ] But chiefly of his kindred deer : [ ? tO ] envy had not him betr [ a ] yed He might have lived full many a year But Weston that attended still , Like Judas on his masters [ worser ] is . Wrought cunningly with right good [ will ] Performance of a cursed wish . For enviously when he was dead , To cover by the murder more : [ ? ] would [ ? ] spread [ ? ] The Second part of the Murder of Sir Thomas Overbury . To the same tune . O F which ( good Knight ) he rotting died , To him and to his friends disgrace : Was ever man so false belied , By flanders from a varlet base . [ A ] lass good Knight too well is known , The woeful manner of thy death : By envy thou art overthrown , Yet live thy [ mass ] ses still on earth . Yea all the Plotters of thy fallen By whom thou hast been bought and sold : Are now by heaven discovered all , And not a practice left untold . And blood for blood for vengeance cries , As law and justice does ordain : [ S ] oh murder long in secret lies , Where Conscience lives in lingering pain .
