A New Song in Praise of Captain Batty . COme my Lads fill up your Glass , And never be discourag'd , Drink about and let it pass , We will put them to a Hurry , We will make the Rascalds for to know , We will give them many a sudden blow , And we will work their overthrow , Says Noble Captain Batty . Prince William having crossed the Line , I wish that he may prosper , Captain Batty and all his Men , Is resolv'd to follow after , We will give the French many a Bump , Likewise the Spaniards Thump for Thump , We will make them cry down with a Rump , Says Noble Captain Batty . When we send forth our Cannon Balls , When will make them roar like Thunder , We will beatrice down their Castle Walls , And then we will to Plunder , We will pull all their Popery down , Likewise their King upon his Throne , All for the Glory of England's Crown , Says Noble Captain Baty So Drink a Health to George our King , Upon this Just Occasion , That we may good Tidings bring , All from this Foreign Nation , They are of Mischief fully bent , They think to make us to Lament , But we will make them to Repent , Says Noble Captain Batty .
