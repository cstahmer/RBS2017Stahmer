A merry Wedding Or , Oh Brave Arthur of Bradly To a pleasant new Tune . SEe you not Pierce the Piper His Cheeks as big as a Mitre A piping among the Swain That dance on yonder plain , Where Tib and Tom do trip it , And Youths to the Horn pipe mipe it With every one his carriage To go to yonder marriage Not one behind would stay But go with Arthur of Bradly Oh brave Arthur of Bradly . Why Arthur hath god him a Lass , A bonnier never was The chiefest Youths in the Parish Come dancing all in a Morrice Jumping with much Pride , And each his wench by his side With Christmas gambals flowcing , And Country wenches trouncing They all were fine and gay For the honour of Arthur of Bradly , etc And when that Arthur was married , And his wife home had carried , The youngsters they did wait ; To help to carry up meat Francis carried the Frumaty , Michael carried the Mince-Pye Bartholomew Beef and Mustard And Christopher carried the Custard , Thus every one in his array , [ F ] or the honour of Arthur of Bradly , etc And when that dinner was ended The maidens they were befriended For out steps Dick the Draper And he bid strike up scraper , Its best to be dancing a little And then to the tavern and tipple He called for a hornpipe , That went fine on the bag-pi [ p ] e Then forward Piper and play For the honour of Arthur of Bradly , etc Richard he did led it And Margery did tread it Francis following then And after courteous Jane Thus every one after another ; As if they had been sister and brother , That it was great joy to see , How well they did agree And then they all did say For the honour of Arthur of Bradly , etc Then Miles in his motly breeches And he the piper beseeches To play him Haw thorn buds That he and his wench might trudge , But Laurence liked not that No more did lusty Kate For she cry'd canst thou not bit it To see how fine Thomas can trip it , For the honour of Arthur of Bradly Oh brave Arthur of Bradly A merry Wedding Or , Oh Brave Arthur of Bradly To a pleasant new Tune .
