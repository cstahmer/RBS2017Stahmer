A comparison of the life of Man , Concerning how fickle his estate does stand , Flourishing like a Tree , or Vine , or dainty flower , Or like a ship , or rain , that's turn'd each hour . To the tune of Sir Andrew Barton . AS I lay musing all alone , Great store of things I thought upon , And specially of men estate , And how hee's subject unto Fate . First I'll compare him to a tree , Which you sometime all green may see , But suddenly his leaves do fallen That he was beautify'd withal . The Tree likewise is known by's fruit Better then by his fine green suit , He may show comely to the eye , Yet his fruit may taste bitterly . So men sometime make a fair show , All fresh and green they seem to grow , But when the winter of grief and thrall Does on them seize , their green leaves fallen . But for the difference of men's fruit , I must indeed be something mute , But those that grow like Cedars tall Yield little fruit or none at all . Yet do they flourish fresh and green , Much like the pleasant summer Queen : They are bedect with fragrant flowers , And they do dwell in stately Towers . But as the Tree is great and tall , The great and mightier is his fallen : And as he falls , so does he lie , Until the builder him apply . What though a man have store of wealth , It cannot him assure of health , By his fruits he must sure be try'd , Either condemn'd or justify'd . Again , a man is like a Vine , That from the earth does flourish fine , Adorn'd with nature's ornament , With store of Grapes to give content . But with a knife , or such a thing , The Vine is soon set a bleeding , And then those Grapes will soon decay , And piningly will waste away . Even so stands the life of man , If that his blood from him be drawn , Then suddenly his life does yield , And unto death he is compell'd . Man flourishes even like a flower , Which lives and dies within and hour , He grows perhaps until his prime , Or he may die in's budding time . He may chance live till he is old , And bide the brunt of Winter's cold , But then hee'l loose the smell and show , And will no more be worth the view . So many men die in their prime , And some die in their budding time : But he that lives the longest life , Shall find but sorrow , care , and strife . men life is like a ship o'th Seas , Which is sometime as Fortune please , Sometime in safety , yet not still so , Even as proud Boreas blasts do blow . When Winds are still and weather's fair , Then Mariners are free from care ; But when as storms make dark the sky , Then must each man his labour ply . The second part To the same tune . SO is't with man the self same case , His life's a ship that seas does trace , And oft is like to go to wrack When winds and storms do tacklings crack . We men when sickness does assail Our bodies , and makes us look pale , Then would we do all things we may , So that our health we might enjoy . But when the Fates on us do smile , Like Sailors we forget our toil . We hang out colours for a show , But take them in when storms do grow . I may compare a man again Even like unto a turning rain , That changes even as does the wind , Indeed so is men fickle mind . The mind of man does often change , Hee's apt with every gale to range , He stands tottering to and from , Even as his foolish fancies go . Again I may men life compare Like to a bird that flies i'th air , And suddenly she sees a bait , Which is to take her with deceit . The bird no sooner is betrayed , But comes me him that the bait laid , And having taken her in his Net , She dies , and he for more does bait . Even so is man by cunning caught , When as thereof he hath no thought , He soareth high and fears no fallen , Yet then hee's in most danger of all . Make trial of this any one , And you shall find that I have shown A prospect where you may behold The difference in this earthy mould . This life is fickle , frail , and vain , Seek everlasting life to gain . All worldly treasures soon decay , And mortal man returns to clay . Before thou diest bid pride adieu , Which does so often shape thee new , Call out for mercy with loud voice , And let her be thy only choice . If thou have liv'd in gluttony , Forgetting quite that thou shalt die , Then quickly charity embrace , That she may plead well in thy case . If thou by covetousness have liv'd , And hast thy neighbours poor deceiv'd , Then suddenly restor't again . For fear thou feel hells burning pain . Perchance in wrath thou hast shed blood , Which wrath should always be withstood , Yet arm thee with a patient heart , And never more act such a part . If thou hast envy'd at thy brother , Repent with speed , that black sin smother , And let true love be thy delight , Thou mayest depart with life this night . If thou hast slothful been , and lewd , Neglecting Gods most holy word , Apply thy self most speedily , Redeem thy time spent idly . If thou lascivious hast been given ; Do so no more , but pray to heaven , That hateful sin God may forgive , Chastise thy self , repent , and grieve . Thus to conclude , let me entreat All those that hear what I relate , That they seek heavens grace to find , And always bear and upright mind . Printed at London for Francis Coules FINIS . R.C.
