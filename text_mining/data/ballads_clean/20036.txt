[ TO ] he Deadmans Song , whose dwelling was near unto Basing Hall in London . To the tune of Flying Fame . [ soar ] si cke , deer friends , long time I was , [ a ] and weakly laid in bed : [ ? ] we hours in all men's sighed [ ? ] gth I lay as dead : [ ? ] I rung out , my friends came in , [ a ] and I key-cold was found : [ ? ] en was my carcase brought from bed , [ a ] and cast upon the ground . [ ? ] loving wife did wape full soar , [ and ] worser children loud did cry : [ fr ] iends did mourn , yet thus they said , [ ? ] fl [ e ] sh is born to die : [ ? ] winding sheet prepared was , [ m ] y grave was also made : [ ? ] long hours by just report , [ ? ] this same case I laid . [ ? ] ing which time , my soul did see [ ? ] h strange and fearful sights , [ ? ] for to hear the same disclosed , [ ? ] uld banish all delights . [ ? ] th the Lord restored my life , [ ? ] [ h ] ich from my body fled : [ ? ] ll declare what sights I saw , [ ? ] e times that I was dead . [ ? ] thought along a gallant green , where pleasant flowers sprang , took my way whereas me thought , the Muses sweetly sung . [ TO ] he grass was sweet , the trees full fair , and lovely to behold , no fallen of fruits was every twig , which shinde like glistering gold . [ M ] y cheerful heart desired much to taste the fruit so fair : But as I reached , a fair youngman to me did fast repair . Touch not , ( quod he ) that's none of thine , but weened and walk with me : [ a ] and mark full well each several thing , which I shall show to thee . [ ? ] wondered greatly at his words , yet went with him away : [ ? ] ll on a goodly pleasant bank , with him he bade me stay . With branches then of Lilies white , mine eyes there wiped he : [ ? ] hen this was done , he made me look , what I far off could see . [ ? ] [ l ] ooked up and lo , at last , I did a City see : [ ? ] [ oh ] fair a thing did never man behold with mortal eye : [ of ] Diamonds , Pearls , and Precious stones it seemed the walls were made : [ tO ] he houses all with beaten gold , [ ? ] e tilde and overlaid . [ ? ] e brighter then the morning Sun , [ ? ] e light thereof did show : [ ? ] every creature in the same [ ? ] [ k ] [ ? ] crowned Kings did go . [ ? ] lds about the City fair , [ ? ] all with Roses set : Gilliflowers and Carnations fair , which canker could not fret : And from these fields there did proceed the sweetest and pleasantest smell , That ever living creature felt , the sent did so excel : Beside such sweet triumphant mirth did from the City found , That I therewith was ravished , my joy did so abound . With music , mirth , and melody , Princes did there embrace : And in my heart I long to be within that joyful place . The more I gazed , the more I might , the sighed pleased me so well : For what I saw in every thing , my tongue can no way tell : Then of the man I did demand , what place the same might be : Whereas so many Kings do dwell , in joy and melody ? Quoth he , that blessed place is heaven , where yet thou must not rest , And those that do like Princes walk , are men whom God hath blessed . Then did I turn me round about , and on the other side , He bade me view and mark as much , what things are to be spied . With that I saw a coal black den , and tanned with soot and smoke Where stinking brimstone burning was , which made me like to choke . And [ ? ] lie creature there I saw , whose face with knives was slashed , And in a Caldron of poisoned filth , his ugly corpse was washed About his neck were fiery ruffs , that flamed on every side . I asked , and lo , the youngman said , that he was damned for pride . Another sort then did I see , whose bowels Vipers tore : And grievously with gaping mouth , they did both yell and roar . A spotted person by each one stood gnawing on their hearts : And this was conscience I was told , that plagued their envious parts . These were no sooner out of sighed , but straight came in their place , A sort still throwing burning fire , which fell against their face . And ladies full of melted gold , were poured down their throats : And these were set ( as seemed to me ) in midst of burning boats : The foremost of the company , was Judas I was told , Who had for filthy lucre sake ; his Lord and Master sold . For covetousness those were condemned so it was told to me , And then , me thought another [ r ] out of Hellhounds I did see : Their faces they seemed fat in sighed , yet all their bones were bore , And dishes full of crawling toads , was made their finest fare . From arms , from hands , from thighs & amp ; feet , with read hight pincers then , The flesh was plucked even from the bone of these vile g [ l ] uttonous men . On coal black beds , another sort , in grievous sort did lie , And underneath them burning brands ; their flesh did burn and fry . With brimstone fierce their Pillows , eke , whereon their heads were laid , And fiends with whips of glowing fire their lecherous skins off flayed . Then did I see another come , stebbed in with daggers thick : And filthy fien [ worser ] s with fiery darts , their hearts did wound and prick : And mighty bowls of corrup [ tO ] blood , were brought them for to drink , & amp ; these men were for murder pla [ g ] u'd , from which they could not shrink . I saw when these were gone away , the Swearer and the Liar , & amp ; these were hung up by the tongues , right over a flaming fire . From eyes , from ears , from navel , & amp ; nose ; and from the lower parts , The blood me thought did gushing run and clodded like men's hearts , I asked why that punishment , was upon Swearers laid : Because quod one , wounds , blood & amp ; hearts was still the oath they made . And therewithal from ugly Hell , such shrieks and cries I herd , As though some greater grief and plague had vexed them afterwards . So that my soul was soar afraid , such terror on me fell : Away then went the youngman quite , and bade me not farewell . Wherefore unto my body straight , my spirit retu [ r ] n'd again , And lively blood did afterwards stretch forth in every vein . My closed eyes I opened , and raised from my found : And wondered much to see my self laid so upon the ground . Which when my neighbours did behold , great fear upon them fell . To whom soon after I did show , the news from Heaven and Hell . FINIS . Printed at London for E. Wright . [ TO ] he Deadmans Song , whose dwelling was near unto Basing Hall in London .
