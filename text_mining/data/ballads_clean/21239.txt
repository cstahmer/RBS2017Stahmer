Come turn to me , thou pretty little one , and I will turn to thee . To a pleasant new tune . S Weet if thou wilt be As I am to thee Then by Cupids Mother , I have vowed to have none other she : Then turn to me thou pretty little one and I will turn to thee . Those bright eyes of thine Which do dazzle mine , Like the stars of Heaven , Which do keep their even course and shine : Then let us in Conjunction meet and both our loves combine . If that lovely face , Will to mine give place , That with loves devotion We may use the motion of embrace : Then fit thee down my pretty little one , and let us love a space . What hurt is in this ? For to take a kiss If it may be granted ; I that long have wanted such a bliss : Then be not sparing of a few whereas such plenty is . If thy breasts do pant , For the milk they want , Every Hill and Mountain To supply each fountain , be not scant : Then give to me thy lily white hand , and I thee mine will grant . If so be that I , May but thee come nigh , The Vine , and Elm shall never , Join more close together than will I , Then show thy fruits my amorous joy and i'll with love supply . If that thou dost crave , Silks and Garments brave Or what rich attire : Could thy heart desire to receive : Declare to me thou pretty little one , thou canst but ask and have . From the Indias far , Where rich Jewels are I will bring thee treasure Far beyond all measure and compare : Then be not coy my pretty little one for I no cost will spare . S Weet-heart for thy sake , I will never make , Choice of any other , Then by Cupids Mother ; freely speak : It's at thy choice my dearest love , either to leave or take . I thy Mary Gold : Wrapped in many fold . Like the Golden Client , To the Sun supplient , show it's a gold : Display thy beams my glorious Sun , and i'll to thee unfold . Those bright locks of hair , Spreading over each ear , Every crisp and curl ; Far more rich then pearl . does appear : Then be thou constant in thy love , and I will be thy Dear , Till I have possessed , Thee whom I love best , I have vowed for ever : In thy absence never , to take rest : Deny me not thou pretty little one , In whom my hope's are blessed . If a Kiss or two , Can thee a favour do , Were it more than twenty , Love's endued with plenty ; Lovers know : For thy sweet sake a thousand take , for that's the way to woo . It does grieve my heart , From thee for to part ; It is to me more pleasant , Ever to be present , where thou art : Yet in the absence of a friend , my love shall never start . As to me thou art kind , Duty shall me bind : Ever to obey thee , Reason so does sway me , to thy mind : Thou hast my heart where ever thou art although I stay behind . In thy bed or bark , I will be thy mark : Couples yet more loving , Never had their moving : from the Ark , Welcome to me my only joy , all times , be it light or dark . London , Printed for J.
