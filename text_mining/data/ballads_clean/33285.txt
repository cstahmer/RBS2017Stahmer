The City Caper : OR , The WHETSTONES-PARK Privateer . Being a true relation how a small she Pickaroon lately sail'd from the park , and Cruising abroad in the night , seiz'd on a rich Merchantman , whom she tempted to board her , and then she disabl'd his Ship , took all his Cargo , spoil'd his Tackle , and burned his Rudder , etc Tune of , Captain Digby's farewell . THe Jenny a small Pickaroon in the Park Last night went a Cruising abroad in the dark , Her impudence was her commander in chief , Her haven is Lust , and her Pilot a Thief : As swift as a Fish she did glide by the Strand , well rig'd , and well trim'd but she lacked to be man'd In her mouth a whole teer of Damme's there lies , Granades were shot out of her rolling eyes . The ruffling silk of her Petticoat Sails , The wind had full blown with it's wantoning gales that wind which their meeting with contrary wind Sometiemes does create hurricanes behind : Carreen'd and new pained most curiously , Her uppermost Deck did appear to the eye , The curls of her Tower so like streamers do wave Men of War to engage her they seem for to brave But look on her Stem , she is right for the trade , Her Lading betwixt wind and water was laid , A Loof , and a Loof and most steady she steered , Yet often to altar her courses apear'd , To Starboard and Larboard , a baft and before , She glances and eye and she creeps by the shore , To look what unconveyed Vessels there came , That might help to add to her pilfering game . AT length from her maintop she gladly espies A merchantman far ahead passing her by , Or'e freighted was he , and ready to sink , His Hull was so much over-stowed with drink : She strait makes all Sails she was able , and plies Her Oars to come up to so welcome a prize , Though's head was so light , she was lighter then he And had in and instant brought him by the Lee. Her mobled hood she turn'd up for a Flag , Sometime she shears off & sometime she does lag She hauld him with hums , hut the dulpated Owl , Would not understand her , unless she fell foul : At last a salute with a Gun , in she pours , Your servant she cry'd and he answering yours : She boldly boar up , and for sometime they ride , Yard-arm to Yard-arm , and each side by each side . The battle between them now warmer was grown , And the grappling Irons were mutually thrown , She gave him her broadside of kisses so strong , There was no hope left of his holding out long : Yet on her design better colour to lay , She pretended to tack , as if steering away , Then seeming disabled to bear up again , She offers herself unto him to be taken . He sees her lie by , and then grows the more bold , To venture aboard , and to rumidge her hold , She freely receives him astern and invites , Him for to taste of her Cabin delights : From prow unto poop he did grope her all o're , And finding her Gun to be full Cannon boar , For his Ammunition he swore was as large , And threatened to give her forthwith a due charge , She flung off her Glove as a Flag of defiance , And scorn'd to accept of his terms of compliance , Come bully , quoth she , I will stand thy fierce shot For already I've taken full many a knock : With that below Deck then he thundered in , And she for to tumble and toss did begin , As if that a tempest had rocked her pillow , And danced her vessel aloft on a billow . A calm then succeedeth this storming her honour , He soon had unladed his Cargo upon her , Before , hand he gave her his contracted Guinies , And thought he ne'r sail'd in so pleasant a Pinnace , But quickly that fancy he cursed when he found , How damnable deep she had run him on ground , For just in the fury and heat of the job , He ransacked Placket , she rifled his , Fob . With Watch , Gold , and jewels she slipped out of door Poor Voyager ne'r was so jilted before , His Cargo was lost , and his mainmast was torn His Tackling she spoil'd , and his Rudder did burn Hence learn you young gallants that venture to see The danger of such Pickaroons for to flee , For vessels rich guilded with proud Silken Sails , Oft Fire ships do prove & bear death in their tails .
