C : RB . I.262 ( 033 ) BONNY HELEN A New Song . To the Tune of the Yellow Haird Lady . ON Atrick-side in Yarrow , a place pleasant and fair , I thought on bonny Helen , as I was walking there . As I was walking there , she came into my Mind , I thought my bonny Helen fairest of Woman kind . I said then , bonny Helen if I were now with you , For to kiss you and clap you , as I was wont to do . But I'm now in the Forest where I never was before But yet my bonny Helen I love and shall adore . In the Haughs upon Yarrow , in the Forest so fair , There are many bonny Lasses Milking the Ewes there , Milking the Ewes there , where now I do repair : But yet my bonny Helen shall be my only Dear . O Helen I'm far from you , but yet I will prove kind . Thorough hills and thorough valleys you're still into my mind ; You shall still be in my Mind , and to you I'll prove true , And to all other Lovers I freely bid adieu . FINIS . C : RB .
