The Married-womans Case : OR Good Counsel to Maids , to be careful of hasty Marriage , by the example of other Married-women . To the tune of The Married-mans Case . Y Ou Maidens all , that are willing to wed , before you are we [ l ] l advised , [ Ma ] ke not too much haste to the marriage bed , lest the sheets be too dearly prized : [ Be ] sure to try before you do trust , [ Too m ] any love not but only for lust ; [ And ] make their poor wives to leap at a crust : [ And th ] us lives a woman that's married , is married , [ Thus li ] ves a poor woman that married .

A woman that marries a quarrelling Coxcomb , hath cause enough to distaste her : For when to the Alehouse he brings a Fox home , he'll find some occasion to baste her : She seldom shall go without her face black , She shall not want blows , though vitle she lack , Although from a man he'll perhaps turn his back : And thus lives a woman that's married , is married , Thus lives a poor woman that's married . Not only at home he's given to quarrel , but also in other places : Where now and then , to his wonderful peril , he meets with knocks and disgraces ; And then his poor wife his Surgeon must be , To cure his infirmities ready is she ; Yet for her endeavour ingrateful is he : And thus lives a woman that's married , is married , Thus lives a poor woman that's married . A woman that to a whoremonger is wed , is in a most desperate case : She scarce dares perform her duty in bed , with one of condition so base : For sometime she's bitten with Turnbull - street Fleas , The Pox , or some other infectious disease , And yet , to her peril , his mind she must please : O , thus lives a woman that's married , is married , Thus lives a poor woman that's marr'yd . The second part , To the same tune . A Woman that marries a drunken sot , must look for no competent living ; For he all the day will fit at the Pot , and never takes thought for thriving : From Alehouse to Alehouse all day he will room , While she sits with bred and fair water at home ; Whatever he gets , he gives her none : And thus lives a woman that's married , is married , Thus lives a poor woman that's married . And if she have children , her grief is the more , to hear them complain for victual , While their wretched father ith' Alehouse does roar , and think of their want but little : Too many such husbands there be , the Lord knows , That will have good liquour , how ere the world goes : But she that has such a one , needs no more woes : Yet thus lives a woman that's married , is married . O , thus lives a woman that's married . A woman that is to a gamester espoused , her case is to be lamented : For he from his gaming can hardly be roused , by any means can be invented : He's either at S [ li ] dethrifth , at Tables or Dice , Where while he sits wishing for Kator and Size , His money consumeth away with a thrice : And thus lives a woman that's married , is married . O , thus lives a woman that's married . As long as his purse with moneys is lined , he never has power to give over ; And if he have lost , this still in his mind , that he shall his losses recover : And thus night and day with vain folly he's led And wasts what should maintain his household with bred , Who oft are constrained to go fasting to bed . And thus lives a woman that's married , etc A woman who's tied to a jealous ass , is a slave to his doubtful condition : She hardly dares look any man in the face , but still it produceth suspicion ; He marks her steps with so watchful and eye : And though she all baseness does scorn and worser [ e ] fie , Yet he dreams of horns , when he knows no cause why : And thus lives a woman that's married , etc And thus it is difficult , do what you can , a perfect good husband to light on : Then let no fair Maiden be in love with a man that she hath but only set sighed on : For marriage must not be accounted a toy , One hour brings much sorrows or joy : Then do not ( sweet Damsels ) your fortune's [ destroy ] By being too hasty of marriage , of marriage , Think first how to live when you're married . And thus I'll conclude , as I began , with this friendly admonition : Let no woman heedlessly marry a man , before she has tried his condition : For time will bring every actium to view , And try whither Lovers be faithless or true : And thus , gentle Maidens I bid you Adieu ; Desiring you well to be married , be married , Or else may you never be married .
