The Dorsetshire DAMOSEL : OR , Young NANCY at her last Prayer . Containing her earnest request to Ralph the Miller , to be satisfied whither he would have her or not : Concluding with his kind Answer . To the Tune of , Found Boy , etc Or , Love's a sweet Passion , etc I N Dorsetshire lived a young Miller by Trade , Who had courted sweet Nancy and innocent Maid , Full a Twelvemonth or more he had kept her in hand ; She went to him at last that she might understand What he meant by his fooling and serving her so , Prithee tell me , quoth she , if you'll have me or no ? When first you come to me , How kind was you then ? You would give me sweet Kisses a hundred and ten , Nay , and told me that you did my Beauty adore , Yet you have not been with me this two Months or more ; Therefore pray now resolve me before I do go , Whither you do intend to have me or no ? When ever I come with my Grist to your Mill , You would [ always ] be kissing and courting [ me ] still , I could never be at rest and at quiet for you : I appeal to your Conscience if this be not [ true ] Therefore pray now resolve me before I do go , Whither you do intend for to have me or no ? I Bought you a Cravat to go to a Feast , One that cost Half-a-crown , or two Shillings at least , And beside that I gave you three Else of good Linen For to make you Shirt , of my Mother's own Spinning ; Therefore prithee resolve me before I do go , Whither you do intend for to have me or no ? There's Roger would have me , and calls me his Dear ; He has god and Estate of ten Shillings a Year , Beside forty good Shillings and five in a Purse , Therefore don't spoil my Fortune and hinder me thus , But be pleased to resolve me before I do go , Whither you do intend for to have me or no ? You told me last Easter you'd make me your Bride , Wherefore new N [ ? ] s and Favours I strait did provide , Yet you never came a near me till now June the third ; E'ry honest Man would be as good as his Word : But I prithee reslove me before I do go , Whither you do intend for to have me or no ? You solemnly swore when I sat on your knee That you the had a love and a kindness for me , And if so , What's the reason I am not your Bride ? Faith these linguering Bargins I near could abide ; Let me now be resolved before I do go , Whither you do intend for to have me or no ? It's very well known I am just in my Prime , And to have a kind Husband I think it high time ; If at Michaelmas last [ tO ] he good deed had been done , I might had before now a young Daughter or Son ; Pray resolve me this Question before I do go , Whither you do intend for to have me or no ? The Young Man's Answer . S Weet Nancy , my Promise I do not forget , But I am not resolveed to be Married as yet ; The devouring Sword now is reigning you see , And if I to the Wars should be forced from thee ; Then thy grief , care and sorrow will daily increase , Therefore prithee Love stay till a flourishing Peace . Believe , I swear by the Powers above , That I never will leave thee for any new Love , My desires is that thou wilt patiently wait , Till the Land is restored to a prosperous State ; If I live but till then thou shalt be my sweet Bride , For I love non in all the whole Nation beside .
