JOCKEY and JENNEY : OR , THE Yielding MAID overtaken . IT in the month of May , Jo , When Jockey first I spy'd , He look'd as fair as day too , Good gin I'd been his bride : With cold black eyes and milkwhite hand , I'm ne'er yet saw the like , I wish I had gin awe my land , I'm ne'er had seen the Dike . He fix'd his eyes upon me , With awe the signs of love , I'm thought they would gang thro' me , So fiercely they did move . He took me in his eager arms , I'm made but faint denials ; I'm then alas , found awe his charms , Woe worth such fatal trials . The bonny Lad at last Jo , Was forc'd tell gang away , But I'm had eane stuck fast tho' , Full nine months from that day . And now poor Jenny's maidenhead , Shame on 't they find is lost , The little brat has awe betray'd , Was ever Lass thus cross'd . The Second PART ONE day young Jenny with her son , She to the fields did go , Unto some pleasant Valley , where Sweet smelling flowers did grow ; She sat herself down on the ground , With tears under a tree , Crying Jockey has me betray'd , And will not marry me . Now Jockey was a miller's son , Of Edinbrough Town , And as she sat lamenting there , With tears upon the ground , She see Jockey upon a horse Come riding on the way , And on his flute this muckle Lad Melodiously did play . So soon as she beheld his face , She straightway did arise , To go and meet this bonny lad , The tears stood in her eyes . But when she came to him she cry'd , You've god my maidenhead , This brat has brought my shame to light , When will you with me wed . With that Jockey he did alight , And with a sweet embrace , He said to her , My dearest Dear , Tomorrow in this place , If you'll be sure to meet me here , We to the Kirk will high , And there , my dear , the marriage-knot In love we then will tie . Then with a kiss they both did part , And met again next day They were both marry'd after that , And home they went their Way , Unto a house , whereas that day In joy and mirth was spent , Thus Jenny she was made a wife , Unto her heart's content .
