H : 85284 A Lamentable Ballad of the Tragical end of A Gallant Lord and Virtuous Lady ; Together with the Untimely Death of their two Children . IN Rome a nobleman did wed A virgin of great fame , Fairer creature never did , Dame nature ever frame , By whom he would [ worser ] too children fair , Whom beauty did excel . They were their parents only joy , They lov'd them both so well , The lord he lov'd to hunt the buck , The tiger and the boar , And still for swiftness always took , With him a blackamoor , Which blackamoor within the wood , His lord he did offend , For which he did him then correct , In hope's he would amend . The day it grew unto and end , Then homeward he did haste , Where with his lady he did rest , Until the night was passed , Then in the morning he did rise , And did his servants call . A hunting he provides to go , And they were ready all , To ease his toil the lady did , Entreat him not to go . Alas ! good lady then quoth he , Why art thou grieved so , Content thyself I will return With speed to thee agam [ i ] n Good father quoth the [ l ] it [ tO ] le babes , With us here still remain . Far we [ l ] l dear child [ r ] en I will go , A fine that [ i ] ng for to buy , But they tO [ h ] e [ r ] ewith nothing content , Aloud began to cry , The mother takes them by the hand Saying come go with me Unto the highest tower where You father you shall see , The blackamoor perceiving now He [ tO ] hen did stay behind , His lord to be a hunting gone , [ began ] n to call to mind My master he did me correct , My fault not being great , Now of his wife I [ ' ] ll be reveng'd , She shall not me entreat , The place was moated round about , The bridge he up did draw , The gates he bolted very fast . Of none he stood in awe , He up into the tower went , The lady being there , Who when she saw his countenance grim , She strait began to fear , But now my trembling heart it quakes , To think what I must write , My senses all begin to fail , My soul it does afrihgt ; Yet must I make and end of this , Which ere I have begun , Which will make sad the hardest heart , Before it I have done . This wretch unto the lady went , And her with speed did w [ i ] ll , His just forthwith to satisfy , His revenge to fulfil . The lady she amazed was , To hear the villain speak , Alas ! quoth she , what shall I do , With grief my heart will break , With that he took her in his arms , She strait for help did cry , Co [ n ] tent yourself lady he said , Y [ oh ] ur husband is not nigh , The bridge [ i ] s drawn the gates are shut , Thereforere come lie with me , Or else I do protest and now Thy butcher I will be , The crystal tears [ r ] and down her face , Her changed [ i ] ld [ r ] en cry'd amain , And sought to hell [ p ] their mother dear , But all it was in vain . For that egregious filthy rogue , Her hand behind her bound , And then by force with all his might He threw her on the ground , With that she shrieks ; her children cry'd , And such a noise did make , The town folks hearing her lament , Did seek their bars to take , But all in vain . no way was found , To help this lady's need , Who cry'd to them most piteous Oh help , Oh help , with speed . Some run into the forest wide , Her lord home for to call And they that stood still did lament , That [ i ] s gallant lady [ ' ] s fallen , With speed her lord came posting home , He could not enter in , His lady's cries did pierce his heart , To call he did begin , Oh hold thy hand thou savage moor , To hurt her do forbear , Or else be sure if i do live , Wild horses shall thee tear . With that the rogue run to the wall , He having had his will , And brought one child unto the wall , His dearest blood to spill . The chi [ l ] worser seeing his father there , To him for help did call , Oh father help my mother dear , We shall be killed all . Then f [ e ] ll upon his knees , And did the more entreat , To save the l [ i ] fe of his poor child , Whose fear was then so great , But thy [ s ] vile wretch the little child By bo [ tO ] h his heels did take , And dash'd his brain against the wall , While parents he [ a ] r [ tO ] s did ache . That being done away he run , That [ e ] other child to fetch , And pluck'd it from the mother's breast , Most like a cru [ e ] l wretch . Within one hand a knife he brought , The changed [ i ] l [ worser ] within the other , And holding it against the wall , Saying thus di [ e ] shall thy mother , With that he cut the throat Then to that [ e ] father he did call , To look how he the same [ e ] [ would ] worser cut , Then down the wall her head did fallen , This done he threw it down the wall Into the mote so deep , Whi [ changed ] made the father wring his hands , And grievously to weep . Who was near dead with fear , Yet this vile wretch most cruelly , Did drag her by the hair , And drew her to the very wall , Which when her lord did see , Then presently he c [ r ] ied out , And fell upon his knee , Quoth he if thou wilt save her life Wh [ oh ] m I do love so dear , I w [ i ] ll forgive thee all [ tO ] hat is past , Though they concern me near , Oh save her life I thee beseech , Oh save her life I tee pray , And I will grant thee what thou wilt , Demand of me this day , Well quoth the moor , I do regard The moan that thou dost make If [ tO ] how wilt grant me what I ask , I'll save her for thy sake . O save her life and then demand Of me what thing thou wilt . Cut off thy nose and not one drop Of her blood shall be spilled , With that the lord presently took A knife within his hand , And then his nose he quite cut off In place where he did stand . Now I have bought my lady's life , Then to the Moor did call , Then take her quoth this wicked rogue , And dowh he let her fallen , Which when her gallant lord did see , His senaes all did fail , Yet many sought to save his life , Yet nothing could prevail , When [ n ] as the Moor did see him worser [ e ] and , Then did h [ e ] laugh amain , At them who for his gallant lord And lady did complain , Quo [ tO ] h he I know you'll torture me , If that y [ oh ] u can me get , But all your threats I do nor fear Nor yet regard one whit . Wild horses will my body tear , i know it to be true , But i'll prevent you of that sport , And down himself he threw , Too good a death for such a wretch , A villain void of fear , And thus does end as sad a tale , As ever man did hear .
