( 5 ) TO THE Most Illustrious HERO , GEORGE LEWIS , By the Grace of GOD Duke of Brunswick and Lunenburg , Standard - bearer and Elector of the Holy Roman Empire , and also Presumptive Heir by Laws Humane and Divine to the Crown of Great-Britain , France and Ireland . I Sing the Prince the Scourge of Gallick Power , Who , if the Tyrant waft the Bastard o'er , Shall Britain Save as Nassau did before : Hail Mighty BRUNSWICK , in whose Glorious Veins The Blood of Emperor's , Kings , and Heroes Reign . Shall Hair-brain'd Tories with their Right Divine Bring in a Perkin , or a Simmel's Line , To sway a Sceptre which the Gods make thine ? No , SIR , they shan't , the Fates can never do That Wrong to us , if they be Just to YOU : When for our Sins Great ANNA shall demise , Must Rome's Knight-Errant carry off the Prize ? Does ( 6 ) Does Lewis think a Viceroy to obtain By Forgery here , though he has done't in Spain ? No , SIR , our Stars do better Things portend ; YOU're our St. George , our Champion , and our Friend , Britannia from that Dragon to defend . As Orange once did save the Captive Maid , When by French Managers to Room betray'd ; So He foresaw she might be trick'd again , And chosen Great HANOVER to break the Chain : Let Tories to their Lewis Homage do , We have a Greater GEORGE and LEWIS too , When you COME O'ER the Dogs will find it true : Our Lions with YOUR Eagles then display'd , Strike Terror in the Fiends , French Lilies fade , And Marlborough shall bloom without a Shade . FINIS .
