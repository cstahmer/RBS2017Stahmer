H : 135960 Loyalty Triumphant , On the Confirmation of Mr. North and Mr. Rich , Sheriffs of London and Middlesex . As it was Sung at the Sheriffs-Feast at Guild-hall , Saturday September 30. 1682. The SAINTS , with Zealous CLUBS and Staves , Strive to Exalt a Brace of KN --- ES ; But the CITY Chosen TWO LOYAL MEN , Which made the WHIGS as mad again . To the Tune of , Joy to the Bridegroom . I . FIll up the Bowl , and set it round , The day is wone , the Sheriffs crown'd ; The Rabble flies , the Tumults yield ; And Loyalty maintains the Field ; Saint George for England , then amain , To Royal CHARLES this Ocean drain . II With Justice may it ever flow , And in and endless Circle go ; The brim with conqu'ring Bays be crown'd , And Faction in the Dregs lie drown'd : Then to the QUEEN , and Royal James , Sacrifice your flowing Thames . III . Thanks to Sir John , our good Lord Mayor , 'Gainst Sheriffs Tricks He kept the Chair ; The Court and City's Right maintains , While headstrong Faction broke the Reins : Then to the famous Sir John Moor , May after-Age that Name adore . IIII . What Zeal ( the Whigs ) to the Old Cause , Thus makes you act against the LAWS ; That none for Sheriff must contend , But your old IGNORAMUS Friend ? But now , your hope's are all destroy'd , And your two Champions laid aside . V. Is this your love to Church and State , That no good man must serve of late , While you can find one Factious R --- , To sway the Poll , and get your Vogue ? By unjust means your Rights you claim , And lawless Force maintain the same . VI . But brave Sir John , while th' storms increase , His Wisdom made the Tumults cease ; In spite of all Illegal Poll , The Routs and Riots did control : Whence He shall gain a lasting Name , And after-Age Record His Fame . VII . among the Men of chiefest worth , The Vote is given for Loyal NORTH , In spite of Pilk --- and Sh --- , Pap --- , and the Rabble-Rou Then to brave NORTH a double Doze , Who the strong Factions did oppose . VIII . Now BOX withdraws , Dubois contends , And Noble RICH the Stage ascends ; By Legal ( 'gainst Illegal ) Vote , The Loyal Tribune they promote : Then to brave RICH a Health off hand , Who the loud Tumults did withstand . IX . For Ropes and Gibbets the next year , The Whigs ( we hope ) need not despair ; If Rich find TIMBER , ( give them scope ) Brave North will never grudge them ROPE : Then , to conclude , we'll crown the Bowl With a Health to th' King and each Loyal Soul.
