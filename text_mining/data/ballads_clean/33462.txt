The West-Country MISER : OR , AND Unconscionable Farmer's Miserable End : Who having Hoarded up his Corn in hope's it would rise to a higher Price , was Disappointed so that he fell into Despair , and Died at last by the fright of and Apparition . Tune of , Love's a sweet passion : or , Found Boy , etc LEt all loving people be pleas'd to at [ n ] worser , To a woeful relation sent up by a friend , Of a counterfeit [ u ] pl [ e ] of farmers who happen'd of late , To discourse as the [ y ] met at the parish church gate : Now the one was a miser who hoarded him [ s ] sto [ r ] e , And [ tO ] he other was loving and good to the poor . The miser he seem'd to be troubl'd in mind , For his heart was to cruel oppression enc [ l ] i [ n ] 'd , Though he came from a sermon , yet nevertheless , In a passion th [ e ] se words he began to express : Now the price is abated of all sorts of grain , But I'll never fell mine till they raise it again . O neighbour ! How can you thus murmu [ r ] ing stand , When the Lord by a gracious and plentiful hand , Has been pleas'd to replenish our barns again , Therefore sure we we have not any [ c ] ause to complain : I re [ j ] oyce in a p [ l ] enty , for last yea [ r ] I know That tO [ h ] e poor they with hungry beliies did go . The miser reply'd with a fury so hight , Friend , a fix for the poor , faith , I valve them not , A good pr [ i ] ce I am willing to make of my corn , But I ne'er was so bauk'd since the day I was born ; Above two-hund [ r ] ed pound I shall lose now I fear , By the wheat which I might have sold off the last year . The other said , Neighbour , you have your worser [ e ] sert , You can blame none alive but your covetous heart , For you reckon to fell it for twice as much more , And for that very reason you keep up your store ; Since you had such a cruel and covetous mind , I declare of a truth you were serv'd in your kind . The miser cry'd , When I lie down in my bed , I have nothing but troubles and cares in my head ; Oh , this plenti [ f ] ul summer my purpose did cross , I am almost distracted to think of my loss ; But I'll keep it as long as my ba [ r ] ns w [ i ] ll hold , E'er at such a low ma [ r ] ket my corn shall be sold . O cruel oppressor , the other reply'd , The sweet [ e ] et blessings of God then it seems you will hide , Which he sends for to nourish the raze of mankind , In your barns fo [ r ] profit it must be confin'd ; Sure the name of a changed [ r ] istian you do not deserve , Who desires to see your poor brothers starve . If God had no greater compassion then you , N [ e ] ighbour , what would this land of poor sufferers do ? In the tilling our ground we might labour and strive , Ay , and yet not have bred for to keep us alive ; Oh but blessed be God in the heaven's above , He has sent us down showers of his infinite love . They parted and home the old miser repair'd , As he enter'd the yard he was woefully scar'd , There the Devil with silver and gold worser [ i ] worser appear , For to buy all [ l ] his corn that was left the last year : And no sooner the miser had set him a price , But this strange apparition was gone in a trice . He run in and told them what he had beheld , Being frighted they were with astonishment fill'd ; All the ni [ g ] ht in his bed he raving did lie , Let [ m ] e fell of my counterfeit [ r ] n , I'll no [ tO ] keep it not I : To the grief of his friends thus he languishing lay , And he dy'd about five of the clock the next day . Now let not our thoughts after vanities range , For this was a sad sudden and sorrowful change , On the wealth of the world he had set his whole heart , Yet from that he was fo [ r ] ced with sorrow to par Now let his fatal end be a warning [ to ] all , Who in dealing makes not any conscience at all .
