The distressed Virgin : OR , The false Youngman , and the constant Maid , The qualities of them both displayed . To and excellent new Tune . A Thousand times my love commend , to him that hath my heart in hold , I took him for my dearest friend , his Love I more esteem'd than Gold . When that mine did eyes see his face , and that mine cares had herd his voice , His Love I freely did embrace , my heart told me he was my choice . O had he still continued true , and in affection permanent , Had he performed what was due , then had I found true hearts conten But he , regardless of his vow , which he did make to me before , Hath thus in sorrow left me now , my former follies to deplore . Would I had never seen those eyes , that ( like attractive Adamants ) Did my poor heart with love surprise , the power of love so me enchants . I have no power to leave his love , though with stern hate he me pursue . To him I will most constant prove , though he be faithless and untrue . I put my finger unto the bush , thinking the sweetest Rose to find , I pricked my finger to the bone , and yet I left the Rose behind : If Roses be such prickling flowers , they must be gathered when tha're green , But she that loves and unkind Love , alas , she rows against the stream . O , would he but conceive aright , the grief that I for him sustain , He could not choose but change his spite to faithful love , and leave disdain . I love to have him still in place , his too long absence makes me mourn , Yet he disdains to see my face , and holds my company in scorn . It grieves my heart full soar to think , that he whom I so dearly love , Should thus refuse with me to drink , yet can my passion ne're remove : Though he , I know , could wish my death , so great is his inveterate hate , Yet I could sooner loose my breath , than see him wrong'd in name or state . Ill hap had I to come in place , where first I saw his tempting look , As soon as I beheld his face , I Cupids prisoner straight was took : And never since that fatal hour I have enjoyed one minutes rest , The thought of him is of such power , it never can forsake my breast . Then was I struck with Cupids Dart , then was my fancy captivated , Then did I vow that still my heart should rest with him though me he hated : Then did he make a show of love , which did much more my heart inflame , But now he does perfidious prove , and gives me cause his love to blame . The second part , To the same tune . NAy more , he made a vow to me , that I should be his wedded wife , And he forsakes me now I see , which makes me weary of my life : I little thought what now I find , that Youngmen could dissemble so , Sure he's the falsest of his kind , ill hap have I to prove him so . Could any man be so hard hearted , to leave a harmless Maid in grief : From me all comfort clean is parted , unless his favour grant relief . He is the man that bred my pain , he is the man whose love alone Must be the salve to cure my pain , or else my life will soon be gone . O faithless wretch , consider well that Heaven abhorreth perjury : Great torments are prepar'd in Hell for them that thus will swear and lie . O hadst thou never made a show of love , thou hadst excus'd thy blame : But thy false heart full well does know what oaths thy perjur'd tongue did frame . That obstacle that hinders me is that which I suspect full soar : His fruit grows on some other tree , and he's seduced by some whore : Or else he hath some other Lass , perhaps like me , a harmless Maid , Whom he may bring to such a pass , as I am brought by Cupids aid . O Heavens forbid that any one , that bears and honest loving mind , Should thus have cause to grieve and moan , for such a knave that shames his kind , But why should I as passion move , with bitter words upon him rail , Whom I am ever bound to love , until my vital spirits fail . Sweet Love forgive my lavish tongue , if I offend in any sor To recompense thee for that wrong , I'll always give thee good repo [ r ] tO , Although to me thou art unkind , who never gave thee any cause : Yet I am still resolv'd in mind , never to break God Cupids Laws . And if I never be thy wife , ( which is the thing I justly claim ) I vow to live a single life , and never think of Lovers game . But why speak I of life , when death does every minute claim his endue ? I cannot long retain my breath , having a Lover so untrue . Let all true Lovers judge aright , in what a case poor soul am I : Come gentle death , and work thy spite , for now I am prepar'd to die : Oh Heaven forgive my Love his wrong , done unto me a Maiden pure , Who for his sake must die ere long , for long my life cannot endure .
