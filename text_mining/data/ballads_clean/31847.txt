No power but the High Court of Heaven could tell What fate should befall to that High Court of Hell , Hugh Peers , Jack Hewson , Cook , Carew and Scot , Tom Harrison , Hacker , and Jones had forgotten , ( As now it appears In these latter years ) Gods High Court of Justice hath overcome theirs , In spite of Rebellion , Plots , Plunder and War , Their High Court of Justice is brought to the Bar , What Villains but they could have sentenc'd a King In whom all the graces of Princes did spring . Their hearts were more hard than Barbarians are To bring such a Prince from the Throne to the Bar , A Monarch that meant All love and content , Unto the Church , and the State and Parliament , Which they did cut off by a Council of War , But now their High Court is brought down to the Bar. It was a great since 'gainst their conscience , I'me sure , That no Law or Gospel could ever endure , Although with a colour of pureness they did it , And under the Mask of Religion they did it , Jack Hewson and Jones St. Hugh and his bones To be the Kings Judges did fit upon Thrones , But now they are coupled like slaves as they are , And their High Court of Justice is brought to the Bar. They set up a new Law for to murder him , But 'tis a good old Law that shall hang up them , These brave men of war and bold Champions must now In Middlesex for't make a new randezvow , Like Rogues they must rally , And from Newgate sally , Unto the sad Sessions-house in the old Bayley , And there to be try'd as all murderers are , For their High Court of Justice , etc Their many successes and victories god , Upon the poor English , the Irish and Scot , Persuaded them that they should live with their treasure In freedom , in safety , in plenty and pleasure That they could not fallen From places so tall , Because they had got the Devil and all ; But now they do find that in spite of the War , Their High Court of Justice , etc Your Sectaries that did all fight for our goods , Renounce all your Actions , and leave you i'th' suds , Your fasting and praying on other men's Lands Have brought your necks under the hangmans commands , The people do moan , The Gallows does groan , Lill you have ascended the three legged Throne , Where you shall be mounted as Murderers are , Whose High Court of Justice , etc Hugh Peters lies terribly under the lash , He now must forsake both the world and the flesh , His Mistress and he must be parted , and then The Butcher may have his own Brindle again , The Gentleman you Did call fool good Hugh , At this time may question you who's the fool now . Such politic knaves the greatest fools are , When High Court of Justice , etc When you flatter'd Oliver up in his since , You did not suppose that the King would come in , When you made Religion your Baud and your Punk You scarce thought upon the Lord General Monk , When for Wedding-Rings , You fought against Kings You little did think to be hagn'd in the strings , From henceforth let all Policitians beware Their High Court of Justice will come to the Bar. They say Hewson's taken , I wish it be true , He was a bold knave , give the Devil his endue , The three corner'd Shop-stall he now must ascend , Where Don will prepare him a Coblers-end ; He rose up in haste , But falls down as fast , And now the blind Cobbler will loose Awl at last , For such hasty risers , their punishment are , When High Courts of Justice are brought to the Bar. Bold Harrison ( as the wild rumour does run ) Will justify this bloody fact he hath done ; But let him take heed left for such a great slaughter His soul meet and High Court of Justice hereafter , A Court that controls , I pity their souls , And shall pray for them when St. Pulchres bell towls God's mild Courts of mercy for penitents are , When High Court of Justice , etc I wish they had never deserved this Trial But bathing their guilty hands in the blood Royal , I griev'd when his Majesty lost his dear breath ; More than I shall joy at his Murderers death ; God bless our good King From Treason and soul spring , And give him those Joys that are everlasting ; Rejoice and be glad all that innocent are , For the High Court of Justice is brought to the Bar.
