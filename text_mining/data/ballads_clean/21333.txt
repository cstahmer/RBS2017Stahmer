And excellent Ballad Entitled the unfortunate love of a Lancashire Gentleman , and the hard fortune ; of a fair young Bride . The Tune is , Come follow my Love . L Ook you faithful Lovers , on my unhappy state , See my tears distilling , but poured out too late ; And buy no foolish fancy , at too dear a rate , Alack for my Love I shall die . My Father is a Gentleman , well known of high degree , And tender of my welfare evermore was he ; He sought for reputation , but all the worse for me , alack , etc There was a proper Maiden of favour sweet and fair , To whom in deep affection , I closely did repair : In heart I dearly loved her , lo thus began my care ; alack , etc For nature had adorned her , with qualities divine , Prudent in her actions , and in behaviour fine Upon a sweeter creature , the Sun did never shine : alack , etc Nothing wanting in her , but this the grief of all , Of birth she was but lowly , of substance very small , A simple hired Servant , and subject to each call , [ alack , etc ] Yet she was my pleasure , my joy and hearts delight , More rich then any treasure more precious in my sighed , At length to one another our promise we did plighted . alack , etc And thus unto my father the thing I did reveal , Desiring of his favour , nothing I did conceal , But he my dear affection regarded never a deal : alack , etc Quod he thou graceless fellow thou art my only heir : And for thy own preferment hast thou no better care ? To marry with a beggar that is both poor and bore : alack etc I charge thee on my blessing thou do her sighed refrain , And that into her company the [ u ] never come again : That you should be so married I take it in disdain : alack , etc Is there so many Gentleman of worshipful degree , That have most honest daughters of beauty fair and free and can none but a beggars brat content and pleasure thee ? alack , etc By God that made all creatures , this vow to thee I make , If thou do not this beggar refuse and quite forsake , From thee thy one inheritance I wholly mean to take : alack , etc These his bitter speeches did soar torment my mind .
