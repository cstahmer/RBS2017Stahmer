[ ? ] Gloucestershire , Doctor of . ( For a perfect copy See vol. 3. p. 206. ) [ ? ] I Will persuade him thus and say , Last time that you together lay , the Moon it was Eclipsed strange , And nature did her courses change , Mars by Dame Venus was beguil'd , And so your wife god you with child . this bargain made brought much content Home in all haste the farmer went ; And told his wife so strange a tale , As made her Countenance look pale : Dear wife quoth he I am perplexed , Never was man before so vexed . I am encumbered with great pains , from top to toe through all my veins ; My back and sides grieve me so soar , Such pains I never felt before : But yet the greatest pain I tell you , Lies rumbling up & down my belly . Husband quoth she I can you tell , Of one that soon can make you well , He cures as I do understand , All diseases tha [ tO ] he takes in hand ; And if you pleasant [ ? ] have it so , I'll to him with y [ oh ] ur water go . Next morning [ g ] with a good intent , the goodwife [ to ] the Doctor wen and shows to h [ i ] m her Husbands water , Now mark that [ e ] jest that follows after : Cox body quoth [ tO ] he Doctor mild , thy Husband sur [ e ] lie is with Child the woman she w [ a ] s much amaz [ ' ] worser , And on the Doct [ or ] strangely gaz'd ; Good Sir in kinness now tell me , How such thin [ g ] s in a man may be ? I will , quoth he [ , ] make you no doubt , And time at l [ a ] st will bring it out . When Luna last was in the Eclipse , You with your Husband joined Lips Then Jupiter being wrapped in thunder , turn'd Venus up while Mars lay under By which Conjunction well I wot , Your husband then with child was god . Alas , alas , then said his wife , Is there no means to save his life ? I would not for a thousand pound , My husband he should fallen to th' Ground , Faith quoth the Doctor there is none , No ways to save his life but one . Kind loving Sir , then answered she , If you will be so good to me , to te [ l ] l how I his life may save , I'll give whatever you will have : No cost nor pains that I will spare , to save his life whom I love so dear : But first quod he , isle have you swear , And also have a special care , to let no body know while you live , What Physic he is to receive ; She straightway bound it with and Oath , I'll keep your Counsel by my troth . then mark me well whats to be done , Each night hour setting of the Sun , His Supper then you must provide , Of Eggs , and some choice meats beside : And for to strengthen his we [ a ] k back You must give him a pint of Sack . Which being done , put him to bed , and lay soft Pillows under his head ; then make for him a Posset fine , With Sugar and sweet muscadine ; Commixed with Cinnamon and mace , And let him swallow it down apace . When he hath slept and hour or twain , then you must come to him again , And bring with you a lusty maid , which to his belly must be laid : So let them merrily sleep together , and lovingly embrace each other . this course you must for 3 weeks take , And then be sure that it will make , the pain too from his back and side , the maid the torment shall abide , And afterwards in little space , She will bring forth a babe of Grace . And when the maid is brought to bed , Your self must lie down in her stead ; And because nothing must be known , Folks must believe the Child's your own , Be sure to take this course said he , So shall your Husband cared be . the woman having herd this news , Ran home in haste how could she choose Where she did see her husband lie , Like one just ready for to die : then presently she did unfold , All that the Doctor had her told . Alas quoth he such pangs I have , there is no means my life to save ; Unless you do a Posset make , to cure my belly of the ache : Wherefore the woman out of hand Did as the Doctor did command . A Supper of most dainty meat She made him ready for to eat ; And because he should no Physic lack , She after Supper gave him Sack ; then kept him warm within his bed , And with sweet Posset she him fed . this being done , with Cupids aid , She god the goodwill of her maid , to lie and keep her master warm , and said he should do her no harm , the maid at first seem'd loath to do , But at the last yiel [ worser ] ed thereto . And as the Doctor did [ f ] or [ e ] tell , So every thing in order fell , the maid in time was brought to bed , the good wife lay down in her stead : the man was of his burden eas'd , the child at Nurse , and all are pleas'd . You that these verses hear or read , If of this Doctor you stand in need , Inquire him out where he does dwell , And surely he will use you well , He'l give you Physic to your mind , So that your purses be well lin'd .
