Death's loud Alarum : OR , A perfect description of the frailty of men life , with some admonitions to warn all men and Women to repentance . To the tune of , Aim not too high . LAment your sins , good people all lament , You plainly see the Messenger is sent , I mean grim death and he does play his part , He stands prepar'd to strike you to the hear How suddenly alas there's none does know , We all must yield to Death 'this death we owe . Our time is short we have not long to stay , We are not sure to live one night nor day , No , nor one hour or minute which is less , As God does please our time is more or less : We are all mortal that live here below , And all must die , that is the debt we owe . No strength nor valour can this death prevent , Nor can fair beauty hinder his intent , Both rich and poor must all prepare to die , No King nor Subject can proud death deny : Death fears no friend nor does he dread a foe , We all must die that is the debt we owe . Behold and see all you that smile at death , You plainly see how fickle is your breath , To day alive , to morrow clad in clay , Therefore prepare , repent , weep , fast and pray : Our sins do cause the Lord to send us woe , We all must die , that is the debt we owe . Thy brother's dead and buried in the ground , Prepare thy self , the mournful Bell does found , The grave stands open ready to receive , Whom death does strike , prepare to take thy leave . The day nor hour there is none that does know , We all must die , that is the debt we owe . Then why do we so vainly spend our time , And unto wickedness so much incline ? We live as though we never meant to die , Spending our days most lewd and wantonly : All wickedness does daily in us grow , Yet all must die , that is the debt we owe . In pride and lust we daily do abound , What wicked sins but in us may be found ? Wrath and revenge , with beastly gluttony , With drunkenness deceit and flattery : All this appears apparently in show . Yet all must die , that is the debt we owe . The hearts of men are grown as hard as stone , They'l not give care unto the grief and moan , Which their poor brothers make being oppressed , Take heed hard heart , for death will thee arres And then 'tis doubtful will begin thy woe , For all must die , that is the debt we owe . The second part , To the same tune . IT is our sins does cause Gods wrath to fallen , For we offend ev'n generally all , Both rich and poor with young and old also : Let us repent , lest God increase our woe . If we repent the Lord will mercy show , We all must die , that is the debt we owe . Some seem to murmur and to make complaint , But they are those whose faith is weak and faint , They do not truly fear nor serve the Lord , Nor do they note his blessed holy Word , Upon repentance he will mercy show : But all must die , that is the debt we owe . Gods mercy goes before his justice still , He's always sure to punish us for ill , He lets us escape in hope we may amend , Thus he's to us a father and a friend : But we to him ungraceless children grow , Yet all must die , that is the debt we owe . What can a father do more for a son , Then our good Father and our God hath done ? He made us from the brittle earth and clay , And gave us breath , yet him we disobey : Oh wretched creatures why should we do so , We all must die , that is the debt we owe . Over all creatures man a ruler is , Hath not the Lord done much in doing this ? O think on this and praise him for the same , Give land and glory to his holy name , All men that's living ought for to do so , We all must die , that is the debt we owe . But we forget our duties to our God , Wherefore he now does scourge us with his rod , His punishment we now are like to feel , He shoots his Arrows from his Bow of steel : Which Bow does seem to strike a deadly blow , We all must die , that is the debt we owe . What father always will forgive his child , That disobays his will and is most vild ? Correction does befit a wicked son , 'Tis true we must confess the same each one : Now God correct's us by one blow , In hope thereby , that we will better grow . Then let's amend our lives most speedily , We may live long or suddenly may die , Let us prepare our selves for to repent , It cannot long be ere our glass be spen Our time is short , for certain it is so , We all must die , that is the debt we owe . Happy's that man that is for death prepar'd , Although he die heaven is his reward , He lives to die , and die to live again , In joys eternally for to remain : Thrice blessed's he that lives and dieth so , We all must die , that is the debt we owe . Then seeing all must die as that we must , While we live here , in God lets put our trust , Then we shall die to live with him in joy , And happiness which never will decay : Let all true Christians wish it may be so , For all must die , that is the debt we owe . Look not upon thy pleasures and thy pride , But for thy silly soul do thou provide , Mind not this world 'tis vain and transitory , Mind heaven on high which is a place of glory Unto which place Lord grant that we may go , When we do die : Amen , let all say so .
