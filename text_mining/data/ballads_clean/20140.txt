The Maidens Nay , Or I love not you . To a pleasant new tune . I Spied a Nymph trip over the plain , I lured to her , she turned again , I wooed her as a young man should do , but her answer was , Sir , I love not you . I thought she seemed in every part , So lovely framed by Nature's Art , Her beauty soon allured me to woo , but her answer was , Sir , I love not you . I told her all the sweet of Love , And whatsoever her mind might move , To entertain a Lover true , but her answer was , Sir , I love not you . I told her how I would her deck , Her head with gold , with pearl her neck : She gave a frown , and away she flew : but her answer was , Sir , I love not you . Not me , ( sweet heart ) Oh tell me why Thou shouldst my proffered love deny , To whom my heart I have vowed so true ? but her answer was , Sir , I love not you . My sweet and dearest Love quoth I , Art thou resolved a Maid to die ? Of such a mind I know but few : but her answer was , Sir , I love not you . This is the pleasant Maying time , This is the pleasant golden prime , But age will come , and make you to rue that ere you said , Sir , I love not you . O do not thou my suit disdain , Nor make me spend my time in vain , But kindly grant a Lovers due : yet still she said , Sir , I love not you . Fair Nymph , quoth I , but grant me this , To enrich my lips with one poor kiss : I grant you that which I grant to few . yet still she said , Sir , I love not you . The young man proffering then to depart , It grieved this Maiden to the heart : For having kissed , Oh then did she rue that ere she said , Sir , I love not you . Wherefore with speed she thought it best , To stay him by her kind request , Whose coyness thus had caused her to rue that ere she said , Sir , I love not you . But how at last she did begin , With gentle words to lure him in , The second part shall plainly show , she changed her note of I love not you . The Maidens Answer , Or I love none but you . K Ind sir , quoth she , what needs this haste ? With that a smile on him she cast , Shame curbed her tongue , but affection drew these words , I love no man but you . I feel the force of Cupids Dart , So deep hath pierced my tender heart , Believe me then , for my words are true , you will I love Sir , and none but you . Do not deny my proffered love , Nor think that I the wanton prove : Though women seldom use to woo , yet I will love , Sir , and none but you . When women love , they will it hide , Until their lovers they have tried : Though I say nay as Maidens do , you will I love , Sir , and none but you . Here is quoth she , my heart and hand , My constant love thou shalt command ; And I do vow to be ever true , you will I love , Sir , and none but you . While golden Titan does display , His beams unto the cheerful day ; While Spring the Winter does ensue , you will I love , Sir , and none but you . On thee my love is fixed fast , On thee my love is firmly placed : For thee I'll bid the world adue , you will I love , Sir , and none but you . If Hero should Leander leave , Fair Lucrece Collatine deceive , Or Sirinx prove to Pan untrue , yet I love you , Sir , and none but you . Object no former coy reply , Suspect no future constancy . Accept my love as a tribute due , only to you , Sir , and none but you . The young man noting well her words , This courteous answer then affords ; Give me thy hand take mine in lieu , my love I grant here , and so do you . To Church with speed then let us high , In marriage bans our selves to tie , Where interchanging hands and hearts , I le love thee dearly till death us parts . Mark well my Song , you Maidens coy That count true love a foolish toy : Do not disdain when young men woo , but love them freely , as they love you . Printed at London for John Wright . Finis . R .
