Half a dozen of good Wives . All for a penny . Kind Cozens or Countrymen what ere you be , If you want a good pennyworth , come buy it of me , Sixe Wives for a penny , a young one or old , A cleanly good huswife , a Slut or a Scold . To the tune of , The clean contraryway . IF any standers by that leads a single life , Desirous be of marriage , and feign would have a Wife , Unto the sign of Fortune , let him forthwith repair , And either she or I will help such customers to ware ; For in my time I have made proof of half a dozen , And if thou hast a mind unto't , come take one honest Cozen , o come take her honest Cozen . The first of all my Wives did prove so cross a Dame . What ere I said she still would do contrary to the same , She is so obstinate , that she must have her will . And let me do the best I can , she will be Master still : O this was my good Wife , the best , etc Beside all these good parts , sh'as humours five or sixe , Though I please her never so well at home , she'l play the meretrix , For if my back be turn'd , abroad she straight must gad , And to be brief she is so cross , as I am ene horn-mad : Oh this was my first Wife , the best , etc The second wife I had , was not so light as she , But yet she had I speak to her praise , as rare a quality . A thrifty Dame she was , which prov'd her greatest fault , She let the Maggots crawl ith' meat , to save the charge of Sal O this was my good Wife , the best of the half dozen , etc And when she went to Market , good penny worths she bought , The cheap'st she laid her hands upon , she always with her brought , But if that I dislik'd what she had done that day , Shee'd keep the best until it stunk , and throw the rest away : Oh this was my good Wife , the best , etc The third was some what cleanly , but yet a drunken Sot , Shee'd pawn all things for Ale and Beer , what ever she had god , She scarce would leave a smock , or shoe unto her foot , But at the Alehouse all these went , and some what else to boo Oh this was my good Wife , the best of the half dozen , And if thou'rt weary of a single life , Then take her honest Cozen , Oh then take her honest Cozen . The second part . To the same Tune . BUt yet she had skill in spinning , with her the world runs on wheels : On any ground where ere she comes , she cannot stand , but reels : And yet but once a week with drink shee's overtaine , Which lasteth still from Sunday night , till Sunday come again . O this was my good wife , the best of the half dozen , And if th'art weary of a single life , then take her honest cousin , o then take her honest cousin . The fourth good Wife of mine was wondrous careful bent , She had a care of the maine-chance , to see how all things wen She never would be quiet , if from her sighed I were , For fear lest I should spend it all , and she not have a share . O this was my good wife , the best , etc And if unto a Tavern without her I had gone , She would be there as soon as I , O 'twas a loving one . And for my ill husbandry shee'd keep a piteous coil , And call me Rogue and Cuckold too : but what was she the while ? I think one of my Ants , the best , etc The fifth was a good old woman , and had great care of me : How could she choose ? for by her age she might my Grandham be , And though I say it my self , she stood me in great stead , I durst trust her in any place , and never fear my head : Oh this was one of my wives , the best , etc Yet if I chanc'd to kiss , or on a young wench looked ; You would not think poor harmless soul , how piteous she took' For often times she'd blame me , that I abroad should room , And love another , when I had , so good a piece at home : Oh this was my good wife , the best , etc But o the last of all , she had and excellent tongue , Which is the rarest property , that does to a woman belong : And if I had but vexed her , she us'd her tongue so well , As when she to the purpose spoke , it sounded like a Bell : Oh this was my good Wife , the best , etc She was so good a wife , I must praise her again ; For she excelled all the Scolds , that dwell in Turnagain Lane : I speak as I have felt her , for she bang'd me once so soar , As I have vow'd ere since that time , never to marry more . But here do leave my wives , in number half a dozen , And for a penny will fell all , then take them honest cozen , o then take them honest cozen . And now good women all , whosoever hears this Song , I do not private person tax , to do them any wrong . But if you take exceptions , the thorn you know will prick , And if you touch a gall'd Horse back , the Proverb says hee'l kick . For I make mention of no less than half a dozen : Then whosoere is angry now , will prove my honest cozen , o will prove my honest cozen . FINIS .
