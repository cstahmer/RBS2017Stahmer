TO he Sorrowful Complaint Of Conscience and Plain-Dealing . Against Millers , Usurers , Tailors , and Hostisses , By which poor Conscience and Plain - Dealing was sufficiently abused , as you shall hear by these following lines To the Tune of , Packingtons Pound . This may be P rinted , R. L. S. Entered according to Order . A S through the City I passed of late Plain Dealing I met in a sorrowful state , Both Cold and Dejected , and slighted with all , His grief it was great , and his comfort was small : Poor Conscience stood by him and clearly dismayed , To think that they would not have him in their trade For most of the Nation upon them did frown , Plain-Dealing and Conscience is clearly run down . We have been aranging the Nation all round , To seek entertainment , yet none can be found ; The Graziers and Farmers were all in a rage , Against poor plain-Dealing they vowed to engage ; Each Miller came out with a lusty great Club , And bid us be gone , or our sides they would drub , And thus we were posted through every Town , Plain-Dealing and Conscience was clearly run down . For thus said the Millers if Conscience should stay , We them must give half of our profit away ; For our of a Bushel we can't take a Peck , But Conscience will presently give us a check And Plain-Dealing too he is one of the crew , that straight way will cry we took more then our due For this very reason upon us they frown , Plain-Dealing and Conscience was clearly run down . Our Enemies daily increased so fast , That up to the City we traveled at last , For good entertainment we much did not fear , But when we come there we were never the near : The Misers whose coffers was cramed well with gold Plain Dealing and conscience they would not behold , But knitting their brows , and upon them did frown Plain Dealing and Conscience is clearly run down The Usurers cried they must both be denied , Should we entertain them then what would betide , Of this our Silver and plentiful store , The which we have got by grinding the poor : We should have no comfort , peace , quiet , nor rest , If conscience should harbour or lodge in our breast , For this very reason upon us they frown , P lain-Dealing and Conscience is clearly run down . But when we beheld how the Misers did frown , We then went among all the Tailors in Town , The Tailors no sooner of Conscience did hear , But then how they trembled and quaked for fear : But yet to poor Conscience they gave and abuse , And threw at Plain Dealing their shears & amp ; their goose , Then knitting their brows upon us did frown , Plain-Dealing , etc The Tailors discoursed and held this dispute , We can't pinch a Coat in the making a Suit , But Conscience will presently fly in our face , With frights and with fears of a future disgrace : And thus he would have our profit but small , For Conscience allows us no Cabbidge at all , This is the main reason upon us they frown , Plain-Dealing , etc Poor Conscience he then to the Alewives did go , But yet they no favour nor friendship would show : The Host he did fret , and their wives they did fume And would not so much as show Conscience a room For fear he should into Extravegance run , And tell them of all their old tricks they had done , For this very reason upon us they frown , Plain-Dealing , etc ' This poor Men that Labour & amp ; brings them the coin Which decked them in Silks and in Laces so fine , When may be their wives & amp ; their children may lack Both food for their bells and clothes to their back Yet two pots for one they will commonly score , But Conscience will sharply reprove them therefore For this very reason the Hostess does frown . Plain-Dealing , etc The Alewives in order your stomachs to fit , Will bring in the morning a Relishing bit , And these are the baits and the snares which they lay To tempt and allure men to tarry all day Then calling for Brandy , Tobacco , and Beer , Ah then how the Hostis will simper and sneer , And these are the tricks of the most in the town , Plain-Dealing , etc Then learn to be thrifty before you grow Old , For Age is despised and Charity's cold : For should you now labour and bring them the gains , They then would but call you Old sot for your pains Then let these few lines be your rule and your guide For now is the time for to keep down their Pride , Then joy will increase and your comforts excel , TO hen keep a good Conscience and all will do well .
