H : 135791 The Parliament Dissolv'd at OXFORD , March 28. 1681. From Devonshire . UNder 500 KINGS Three Kingdoms groan : Go F. Dissolve them , CHARLES is in the Throne , And by the Grace of God will Reign alone . What would the Commons have ? the Royal Line Heaven does dispose of ; 'Tis not Theirs , nor Mine , But His by whom KINGS Rule , and are Divine . I Represent the KING of KINGS who gave , The Crown , the Sword , the Sceptre ; What I have ; I am Gods Servant , not the Peoples Slave . Their Frantic Votes , and Mad Resolves I hate ; I know a better way to Heal a STATE , Than to since Rashly , and Repent too late . Bid them be gone F. They are Damn'd Uncivil , To oblige Me to follow Them to th' Devil ; To Save Three Kingdoms I will not do Evil. The Presbyterian's Sick of too much Freedom , Are ripe for Bethle'm ; it's high time to Bleed'em ; The Second CHARLES does neither Fear nor Need em . I'le have the World know that I can Dissipate Those Impolitic Mushrooms of our STATE ; 'Tis easier to Dissolve than to Create . They shan't Cramp Justice with their Feigned Flaws ; For since I Govern only by the LAWS ; Why They should be Exempt , I see no Cause . To the LAWS They must Submit ; 'tis in vain E're to Attempt to shake off those again ; For where CHARLES Commands , There must Justice Reign When the Peoples Father does Espouse the LAW , All those who Subjects from their Duty draw , Do Viperlike , through Parents Bosom gnaw . When They Attend Me next , F. Bid Them bring Calmer Thoughts ; Bid Them Propose Legal Things ; Such as may both become Themselves , and KINGS . This will the Joys of Our Little World Complete , And all Attempts of Foreign Foes Defeat ; Making the People Happy , MONARCH Great . FINIS .
