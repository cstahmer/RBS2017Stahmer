The Power and Pleasure of Love , Is here described and Antidote of joy , Against all grief , which does the heart annoy ; For the greatest Monarch , Clown , and Fool , Loves power does conquer , and keeps all in rule : And those who Love , and kind and constant be , Live in a continued Ecstasy ; But those who do in sorrows constant dwell , Were never in Love , and can't it's pleasure tell . To a new Playhouse Tune : Or , All joy to fair Psyche , etc . With Allowa [ nce ] A LL joy to fair Psyche in this happy place , And to her great Master , who her shall embrace ; May never his Love nor her Beauty decay , But be warm as the spring , and still fresh as the day : No Mortals on earth ever wretched could prove , If still while they lived they be always in love . There's none without Love , ever happy can be , Without it each Brutus were as happy as we ; The knowledge men boast of , do nothing but vex , And their wandering thoughts their minds do perplex : No Mortals on earth , etc Loves sighs and his tears are mixed with delights , But were he still pestered with cares & amp ; with frights ; Should a thousand more torments a Lover invade , In one happy moment they fully be paid : No Mortals on earth , etc Then loose not a moment , but in pleasure employ it , Your youth requires Love , let it fully enjoy it ; For a moment once lost will always be so , Then make no delay , but to plundering go : No Mortals on earth , etc No pleasure like that when true hearts do unite , It's sweet all the day , and more pleasant at night ; Nay one of her smiles , and her balmy white hand , Would conquering Mars in a moment command : No Mortals on earth , etc The second part , to the same Tune . The Merchant that Roves with labour and pain , Through tempests and storms much treasure to gain , His sorrow forgets , when his Love he does meet , And prostrates himself and his wealth at her feet : No Mortals on earth , etc To think of the torments a Lover goes through , And how every hour his sorrows renew ; But though he each minnute a Martyr must be , Yet a smile from his Love will let him be quite free : No Mortals on Earth , etc Nay though a bright virgin most scornful will prove , And seems to disdain all the powers of Love ; Yet when all alone with her Lover she be , She thinks that no Empress so happy as she : No Mortals on earth , etc The Grave and the Sage who blames a young heir , Much wondering how he for a Nymph can despair ; When he sees a brisk Girl , though one foot in the Grave , He no greater pleasure desires to have : No Mortals on earth , etc All the great Hero's that mighty did prove , First took their brave Courage from powerful Love ; Though daily in sorrow , and ever in pain , The thoughts of his dearest revives him again : No Mortals on earth , etc The rustical Clown that lives constant in care , A smile from his Betty will make him to swear ; No Monarch on earth so happy can be , Though Mountains of treasure he daily do see : No Mortals on earth , etc Then let every Monarch and rustical Clown , Disband all false joys , and in Love now lie down ; For there are no joys that we Mortals can show , But conquering Love that all Monarchs subdue : No Mortal on earth ever wretched could prove , If still while they lived they be always in Love .
