The Somersetshire LADY : CONTAINING Her sorrowful Lamentation for her Misfortunes , in and Extravagant SPENDTHRIFT , who by Riotous Living , brought her to Ruin . To the Tune of If Love's a sweet Passion , etc I Am a young Wife that has cause to complain , Yet I fear all my sorrowful Sighs are in vain ; For my Husband he is and invincible Sot , There is nothing he minds but the Pipe , and the Pot : When a Husband he is a sad Spendthrift , you know Then a Wife must sad Sorrow and Grief undergo . I am a Knight's Daughter of Somersetshire , And my Portion was Three or Four hundred a Year ; Which my rambling Husband has blasted of late , For he spends at a woeful Extravagant rate : When a Husband he is a sad Spendthrift , you know Then a Wife must , etc When first he came to me , I needs must confess , He came , like a Spark , in and Officer's Dress ; But in drinking so many good Gallons of Sack , He has scarce a good Coat , or a Shirt to his Back : When a Huaband he is a sad Spendthrift , you know Then a Wife must , etc I know he will revel , and thunder , and call , And suppose there be Twenty , he'll pay for them all , While they are a toping his full flowing Bowl , They will count him a noble and generous Soul : When a Husband he is a sad Spendthrift , you know Then a Wife must sad Sorrow and Grief undergo . It is but a folly to mention my Birth , Or to think of my former rich Pleasure and Mirth ; For , alas ! I am drowned in Floods of sad Tears , For I han't been a Wife above Three or Four Years : When a Husband he is a sad Spendthrift , you know Then a Wife must sad Sorrow and Grief undergo . Believe me good People , as this is my Hand , He has swallowed about Threescore Acres of Land , With and Orchard , and House , a Drawbridge , and great Moat , He has swallowed them down his devouring Throat : When a Husband he is a sad Spendthrift , you know Then a Wife must , etc To see my vast Portion thus wastefully spent , It has cost me , in private , to sighs and lament , And a Thousand times wishing I never had been born ; For my Life is a burden , my Days are forlorn : When a Husband he is a sad Spendthrift , you know Then a Wife must , etc I often have told him , when all is consumed , In Prison , with sorrow , he then will be doomed ; Yet he never regards what I say in the least , But abroad with his Croneys he'll Revel and Feast : When a Husband he is a sad Spendthrift , you know Then a Wife must , etc The Chains , and rich Jewels , I formerly wore , They are gone , I have little , or nothing in store ; And beside , all my Lands are here mortgaged , and sold , There is nothing but Sorrow and Grief I behold : When a Husband he is a sad Spendthrift , you know Then a Wife must , etc O what will become of my Children dear , They will live to know Hardship , and Sorrow , I fear , When they might have lived happy , nay glorious and great , If their Father he had not destroyed their Estate : When a Husband he is a sad Spendthrift , you know Then a Wife must sad Sorrow and Grief undergo .
