The Cooper of Norfolk . [ O ] R , A pretty jest of a Brewer and the Coopers Wife , and how the Cooper served the Brewer in's kind . To the Tune of , The Wiving Age . A Ttend my Master's and listen well , Unto this Ditty , which briefly does tell , Of a fine merry jest in Norfolk befell , A brave lusty Cooper in that Country did dwell : And there he cried work for a Cooper , Maids ha'ye any work for a Cooper . This Cooper he had a fair creature to's wife , Which a Brewer i'th town loved as dear as his life , But she had a trick which in some wives are rife , She still kept a Sheath to another men knife ; And often cornuted the Cooper , While he cried , etc It happened one morning the Cooper out went , To work for his living it was his intent , He trusted at home to his Wives government , And left her a bed to her own hearts content ; While he cried more work for a Cooper , Maids ha'ye , etc And as the Cooper was passing along , Still crying and calling his old wonted Song , The Brewer his Rival both lusty and young , Did think now or never to do him some wrong , And lie with the Wife of the Cooper , Who better loved him , etc He called the Cooper and to him did say , Go home to my house and make no delay , I have as much work as thou canst do to day , Whatsoever thou earnest i'll bountifully pay ; These tidings well pleased the Cooper , Oh this was brave News for the Cooper . Away went the Cooper to the house of the Brewer Who seeing him hard at his labour to endure , Thought he now for this day the Cooper is sure , I'll go to his wife the green Sickness to cure , Take heed of thy forehead good Cooper , F or now I must work for the Cooper . The straightway he went to the Coopers dwelling The good Wife to give entertainment was willing The brewer and she l [ i ] ke two Pigeons was billing And what they did else they bound me from telling , He pleased the Wife of the Cooper , Who better loved , etc But mark how it happened at the last , Their Sunshine of pleasure was soon overcast , The Cooper did lack one of's tools in haste , He ran home to fetch it , and found the door fast , Wife open the door ( quoth the Cooper ) And let in thy husband , etc Now when the good Wife and the Brewer did hear The Cooper at door , affrighted they were , The Brewer was in such a bodily fear , That for to hide him he knew not where , TO oh shun the fierce Rage of the Cooper , He thought he should die by the Cooper . The good Wife perceiving his woeful estate , She having a subtle and politic pate , She suddenly whelmed a great Brewing fat , And closely covered the Brewer with that ; Then after she let in the Cooper , What's under this Tub ( quoth the Cooper ) S He hearing her husband that question demand , she thought it was time to her tackling to stand Take heed how you move it quod she with your hand For there's a live big was left by friend , Oh let it alone John Cooper , Thus she thought to cousin the Cooper . Is it a Sow , big the Cooper did say , Let me have't to my supper , the good wife said nay , It is a Boar big , quoth she , by my faith , It's for my own diet , it given me to day , It is not for you John Cooper , Then let it alone John Cooper . I would it were in thy body , quoth John , Indeed ( quoth the good wife ) so it shall be anon , What ever become of it , faith thou shalt have none , Why standest thou here prating , I prithee be gone , Make haste to thy work good Cooper , Worse meat's , good enough for a Cooper . Cannot a good wife have a bit now and then , But there must be notice taken by the good man ; I'll have't to my dinner Sir do what you can , It may be I long to have all or none : Then prithee content take good Cooper , Oh go to thy work , etc The Cooper mistrusted some Knavery to be , Hid under the Brewing Fat , and therefore he , Was fully resolved for his mind sake to see , Alas ! said the Brewer then woe be to me ; Oh what shall I say to the Cooper , I would I were gone , etc You whore , quoth the cooper , is this your boar-pig , He has been well fed for he's grown very big , I'll either have of him and arm or a Leg , I'll make him unable his tail for to wag Before he gets hence from John Cooper , I'll make him remember , etc O pardon me neighbour , the Brewer did say , And for the offence I have done thee to day , I am well contented thy wrath to allay , And make restitution for this my foul play , I prithee forgive me John Cooper , And i'll be a friend , etc If for this offence thou wilt set me clear , My bounty and love to thee shall appear , I'll freely allow thee and thine all the year , As much as ye'l drink , either strong Ale or Beer , Oh prithee forgive me John Cooper , And i'll be a friend to the Cooper . O no ( quoth the Cooper ) i'll have you to think , That I with my Labour can buy my self drink , I'll geld thee or lame thee ever from me thou shrink The words made the Brewer with fear for to stink He feared the rage of the Cooper , Yet still he entreated , etc This Cooper by no means would let go his hold , The Brewer cried out to the Cooper , and told Him there was the key of his silver and gold , And gave him free leave to take what he would , Oh then he contented the Cooper , These tidings well pleased , etc If thou , quoth the Cooper , wilt swear by and oath , To do all thou tellest me , though I am loath , I will be content to pardon you both , Content quoth the Brewer , I will by my troth , Here take thou my keys John Cooper , Yea with a good will quoth the Cooper . On this condition they both went away , Both John and the Brewer they both went I say , Which opened the Coffer where more money lay , Then John the Cooper had seen many a day ; TO his is a brave fight thought the Cooper , I'll furnish my self , etc John was so far in affection with that , That he took up handfuls and filled his hat , I will have my bargain , quoth John , that is flat , The Brewer shall pay well for using my Fat ; I'll cry no more work for a Cooper , Farewell to the trade , etc Thus money can pacify the greatest strife , For John never after found fault with his wife , He left off his Adz , his Saw , and his Knife , And after lived richly all days of his life : He cried no more work for a Cooper , Oh what a good wife , etc And in this merry mood oft times he would say , If I had hooped twenty Tubs in one day ; I should not have god so much wealth by my faith , Gramercy kind Wife , for thy wit found the way , To make a rich man of John Cooper , Oh what a good Wife , etc Let no Married couple that hear this Tale told , Be of this opinion this couple did hold , To fell reputation for Silver or Gold , For Credit and honesty should not be sold ; Thus endeth the Song of the Cooper , That cried ha'ye any work for a Cooper .
