The Unconscionable Gallant : OR , The Beautiful Lady's Misfortune . To the Tune of Found Boy , etc Licensed according to Order . NOw I pray you attend , to the Lines that are penned , Which abroad to the World we in merriment send ; It is absolute new , and they say it is true , Therefore listen a while unto what shall ensue : A young Gallant of fame to a Friend ' [ s ] House he came , Where he sent for a fair and young beautyful Dame . When her Charms he beheld he with Raptures was filled , Yet although he in Courting was very well Skilled His fine Amorous Ta [ l ] e could in no wise prevail , For without Half a Piece of Joys he should fail : Like a Lady of State she had told him the Rate , And tO [ h ] is done , not a Penny or [ F ] arthing she'd Bait. Half a Piece is too much for a poor single touch , There [ f ] over pray use a Conscience , for faith I do grutch To give more than a Crown for a bit of the Brown , I can would [ v ] e it for less of the Girls of the Town : Therefore make not this fuss , and stand serving me thus , For a light Cain they say makes a rich golden Purse . If a Lady you lack , Sir , I stand to my tack , For I'll have you to know I am no common Crack , That for Six pence or less will their kindness express , Y [ ou ] may see that I go in a rich silken Dress , Paint with powdered Hair and black Patches I wear , Which cannot be maintained with that Price I declare . Pry'the be not so nice , it's a very good Price , [ A ] and thou knows very well it'll be earned in a trice : Therefore do not deny , but with reason comply , And perhaps for my Jewel a Cornet I'll buy . But the Answer she gave , You must give what I crave It's in vain to dispute , for ten shillings I'll have . When he found her so stout , he began to fallen out , And , as some says , he threatened to Kick her about : Since her price she'd n [ oh ] tO Bait , faith his Love turned to hate , And he threatened to Call for and Officer strait : If you will have [ f ] ull Ten , I will punish you then That can be so hardhearted and Cruel to Men . Now the Lady Replied , in regard you're denied , Can you be so uncivil your friend to Deride ? Yes , I will then , he swore : And , [ ? ] s , what is more , Some good Justice of Peace you shall now go before , To Receive the Reward that the Law will afford . Straight with Tears in her Eyes she his pity implored . The Disgrace I do fear , therefore let me go clear , And my Scarf with Five Shillings , I'll render you here , Had I here so much more I would pa [ r ] tO with my store , For , alas ! I was neve [ r ] so fitted before . Then he pitied her Cafe , and would hide the disgrace , And without more to do they departed the place . LONDON : Printed for C.
