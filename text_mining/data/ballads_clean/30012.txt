And Admirable New [ ? ] Northern Story Of two constant Lovers as I understand , Were born near Appleby in Westmoreland ; The Lads name Anthony , Constance the Lass , To Sea they went both and great dangers did pass : How they suffer'd shipwreck on the Coast of Spain For two years divided , and then met a [ g ] ain , By wonderful fortune and care accident , And now both live at home with joy and content . The Tune is I would thou wer't in Shrewsbury . TWo Lovers in the North , Constance and Anthony , Of them I will set forth a gallant History ; They lov'd exceeding well , as plainly does appear ; But that which I shall tell , the like you ne'r did hear . Still she cries Anthony , my bonny Anthony , Gang thou by Land or Sea , I'll weened along with thee . Anthony must to Sea , his Calling did him bind , My Constance , Dear , quoth he , I must leave thee behind . I prithee do not grieve , thy tears will not prevail : I'll think on thee , my Sweet , when the Ships under Sail . But still , etc oHw may that be ? said he , consider well the case : Quoth she , sweet Anthony , I'll bide not in this place . If thou gang , so will I , of the means do not doub A Woman's policy great matters may find ou My bonny Anthony , etc I would be very glad , but prithee tell me how ?

My bonny , etc Anthony's leave she had , and dressed in men array , She seem'd the blithest Lad seen on a Summer's Day . O see what Love can do , at home she will not bide : With her true Love she'll go , let weal or woe betide . My dearest , etc In the Ship 'twas her Lot to be the under Cook ; And at the Fire hight , wondered pains she took : She served e'ry one , fitting to their degree ; And now and then alone , she kissed Anthony .
