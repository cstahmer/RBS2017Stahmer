A merry new Ballad , both pleasant and sweet , In praise of the Blacksmith , which is very meet . To the tune of Green sleeves , etc OF all the Trades that ever I see , There is none with the Blacksmith compar'd may be , For with so many several tools Works he , Which no body can deny . The first that ever thunderbolt made , Was a Cyclops of the Blacksmiths Trade , As in and ancient Poet is said , Which no body can deny . When thunderingly we lay about , The fire like lightning flasheth out , Which suddenly with water we doubt , Which no body can deny . The fairest goddess in the skies , To marry with Vulcan did devise , Who was a Blacksmith grave and wise , Which no body can deny . Mulciber to do her all the right , Did built her a Tower by day and by night , Which after he did Hammersmith hight , Which no body can deny . And that no enemy might wrong her , He gave her a Fort , she needs no stronger Then is the lane of Ironmonger , Which no body can deny . Vulcan farther did acquaint her , A pretty estate he would appoint her , And leave her Seacole lane for a Jointer , Which no body , etc Smith-field he did free from dirt , And sure he had great reason for' For there he meant she should keep her Court Which not etc But after in good time and tide It was to the Blacksmith ratified , And given by Edmund Ironside , Which no body , etc Vulcan he did make a train , In which the god of War was slain , Which ever since was call'd Pauls chain , Which no body , etc And Ninus bred himself much strife , For which he surely lost his life , For doting on a Blacksmiths wife , Which no body , etc There is a law in merry England , In which the Smith hath some command , When any man is burned in the hand , Which no body , etc Banbury-ale a two-yard pot , The devil a Tinker dare stand to't , If once the tossed be hissing hight , Which no body , etc The common Proverb as we read , That we should hit the nail on the head , Without the Blacksmith cannot be said Which no body , etc The second part to the same Tune . ANother Proverb must not be forgotten , For it falls unto the Blacksmiths lot , That we should strike while the Iron's hight , Which no body can deny . A third lies in the Blacksmiths way , When things are as safe as old wives say , We have them under lock and key , Which no body , etc There's yet another which makes me laugh , Because the Smith can challenge but half , When things are as plain as a pikestaff , Which no body , etc Another half to him does belong , And therefore do the Smith no wrong , When one is held too't buckle and thong . Which no body , etc There is one more does seldom fail , When we meet with naughty Beer or Ale , We say it is as dead as a door-nail , Which no body , etc A sullen woman needs no leech , Your Blacksmiths bellows restores her speech , And will fetch again with wind in her breech , Which no body , etc There's never a slut if filth over-smuch her , But owes to the Blacksmith for her leather : For without a pair of tongue's no man will touch her , Which no body , etc If you cleave to your friend when fortune's wheel Does make him any mischances feel , We say such a friend is as true as steel , Which no body , etc There's that's in the Blacksmiths books , Who suddenly for remedy looks , When any man is off the hooks , Which no body , etc Among the Sectaries there are those , That without the Blacksmiths help do suppose , St. Dunston had ne're taken the devil by the nose , Which no body , etc The roaring boy whom every one quails , And nothing but fights , & swears , & rails , Could never yet make the Smith eat his nails , Which no body , etc Though Sergeants at Law grow richer far , And by their good counsel can end a jar : Yet your Blacksmith takes more pains at the bar , Which no body , etc And though laws punish severely still Such as counterfeit deeds , and thereby do ill , Yet your smith may forge what he will , Which no body , etc Though bankrupts lie lurking in their holes , And laugh at their creditors & the catchpoles , Yet the Smith can fetch them over the coals , Which no body , etc Though playing the Jockey is thought a fine feat , As to train up a horse & prescribe him his meat , Yet the Smith knows best how to give him a heat , Which no body , etc Though soldiers have traveled a thousand miles , And think they have all the crafts & the wiles , Yet your Smith can sooner double his files , Which no body , etc And though he hath no Commanders look , Nor can brag of those he hath slain or took , Yet is he as good as ever struck , Which no body , etc Then if to know him men did desire , They would not scorn but rank him higher For what he gets is out of the fire , Which no body , etc Then here's a health to the Blacksmiths all , And let it go round as round as a ball , Let's take it though it cost us a fallen , Which no body can deny .
