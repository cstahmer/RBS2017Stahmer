H : 135902 The Despairing Lover A New Song . How long d'ye Mean to Torture me in Loves hight Scorching Flames Cloris what time Shall I get free from Loves fantastic Dreams , never , that Sad Infernal Found does daily Reach mine ear : and ever racks that bleeding wound which for your Sake which for your Sake I bear : 2 That I do Love Cloris you know My grief to you I tell My over fondness of you Shows That I have lov'd too well And in requital of my Love You blast me with a breath The wounds you gave will fatal prove Each frown pronounce Each frown pronouncing Death 3 It grieves my heart to See you choose My Rival in my Room And unconcern'd tell him the News On Me you've passed your Doom My Injur'd Ghost when ere I Die Shall never let you rest But hovering in the Air shall fly and Steal And Steal into your breast 4 Thus I Torment my Self and doubt that you unconstant are You know true Love is ne're without Great jealousies and fears Than pardon the distracted thoughts Of one you know is true One Love has in Subjection brought and made a Slave And made a Slave to you 5 If you have any pity left than Show it now and Save Him who Despairs of finding rest and don't you Dig my Grave For if I die through your Neglect pray write this on my Tomb My Judge being Fair I did expect a favoura A favourable Doom 6 And since you did my woes procure I'le try if Torments can Increase my flame or help to cure a love distracted Man I'le find some sure yet speedy way to end my misery Too long my ruin I delay and yet seem loath And yet seem loath to Die 7 I'le place my self on Caucasus and there I'le lend such Groans Shall scare the Damn'd Prometheus with my Sad frightful Tones I'le make the Vultures quit their prey and feed upon my breast For through this means perhaps I may find hope's of have Find hope's of having rest .
