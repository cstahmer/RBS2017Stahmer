[ 15 ] O Goodwife , what would you give , For a Sighed of your Daughter alive ? O false Lown , I fear it's thee I wish I had thee slave . [ 16 ] No Goodwife , it may not be , She's better than I god her from thee , She has a Kinshine on her Knee . And a Babe into her Wime . [ 17 ] As she came riding up the Sand , And Four and Twenty at her Hand , She was the fairest in the Land ; And she'll go with the Gaberlounzie Man. FINIS .
