H : 180172 RYOT upon RYO OR , A Chant upon the Arresting the Loyal L. Mayor & Sheriffs . Gallants , If you wou'd hear a Tale sung o'r , So daring and bold , 'twas never done before : See London's Loyal Sheriffs , and Lord Mayor , Bearing the Sword , Arrested in the Chair . To the Tune of , Burton Hall , or London's Loyalty . I . Rouse up Great MONARCH In the Royal Cause ; The Great Defender Of our Faith and Laws : Now , now , or never , Crush the Serpent's Head , Or else the Poison Through the Land will spread . The Noble MAYOR , And his two Loyal SHRIEVES , Bearing the Sword's , assaulted By Usurping Thieves , Who their Rebellious Riots Would maintain by Law : Oh! London ! London ! Where's Thy Justice now ? II Smite , smite , the Snakes Did first their Sting reveal , Stabbing thy ROYAL BROTHER in the Heel ; And struck so many Loyal Martyr's dead , Now in the Sun Flies boldly at the Head. Slaves that resist All Power but their own ; He that would usurp the CHAIR , Would next usurp the THRONE , Who neither ROYAL HEIR Nor LOYAL MAYORS allow : Oh! London ! London ! Where's thy Charter now ? III . LONDON , of Faction's The eternal Spring , Yet so much favour'd By a Gracious KING ; Who dost such Deeds That have no parallel , Only to teach Thy Children to Rebel . This will record thee In the Books of Fame ; This bold Attempt no Law , Nor Precedent can claim : Blood and the Crown , P ------ n And WORSER ------ s outdo : Oh! London ! London ! Where's Thy Charter now ? IV. Was this the way Your Riots to repair ; In spite o'th' CHARTER , To Arrest the MAYOR ? And 'gainst the SHERIFFS Your sham Actions bring , 'Cause justly chosen , And approv'd by th' KING ? What call you this , but TREASON ? While the Fool That did Arrest the MAYOR Expects himself to Rule ; And , save his own , no other Power would allow : Oh! London ! London ! Where's thy Charter now ? V. Hang up the Factious Heads That dare oppose The Sword of Justice , And the Ancient Laws : Who in his Office Dare Arrest the MAYOR , Disowns the Pow'r That plac'd Him in the Chair . Tantara-ra ra ! Let the Trumpets found , Double all your Guards , and let The Cent'nels stand their ground : He that Arrests the MAYOR , Would bind the MONARCH too : Oh! London ! London ! Where's Thy Charter now ?
