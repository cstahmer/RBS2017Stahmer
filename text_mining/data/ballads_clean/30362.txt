The old men life renewed by Heavenly providence . OR , A strange ( yet true ) relation of one Mr. Macklian , a man of and hundred & sixteen years old who when he was about the age of fourscore years old , his strength failed him , and his eye - sighed grew dim ; he was likewise deaf of hearing , and feeble of speech , but now of late the Lord hath shown such a miracle upon him , that he is now become as a young man again ; for his hearing and speech is come perfectly to him , and [ h ] is eyesight is so good that he can write or read the smallest print that is , without Spectacles , [ h ] is teeth which were decayed and rotten out of his head , there are new ones come in their places : and having lost the old hair from off his head , there is now fine young tender hair growing upon the same , like the hair of a Child of two years old . All these strange Wonders are to be seen upon the Gentleman , whose name is Mr. John Macklain , dwelling and living ( so long as Gods pleasure is ) in Northum - berland , in the Town of Lesbury , he being the Parson and Minister of the Parish , preach - eth two Sermons every Sabbath day , where many hundreds of people comes far and near to hear him Preach and to see the wonders of the Lord . The Lord that rules both heaven and earth with his Almighty powerful hand Hath many strange examples sent unto the people of England : But never the like of this before was known or seen of any man , In those same parts wherein we live , since first of all the world began . Therefore with patience now give ear , and harken to the matter well : The truth , and nothing but the truth , I am prepared for to tell . [ At ] Lesbury in Northumberland one Master Macklain dwelling there , He parson of the Parish was . and well beloved far and near : A hundred and sixteen years of Age , this Minister is known to be , Whose eyes through age were grown so dim that he at all could hardly see . His Legs and Joints so feeble were , that he could hardly stand or go , His strength and hearing was decay'd so was his tongue and speech also . But still he did the best he could , among his Parishioners to preach , Being well known in former time , the way of godliness to teach , Yet some that spiteful neighbours were , which then were dwelling there about , Did use all means that they could do , by violence for to turn him out And said , because he [ ? ] there Minister be [ ? ] The reason why , [ ? ] nor could [ ? ] But [ ? ] My friends and kindred are decay'd , my wife and children dead and gone , No one have I to take my part , but only Christ my Lord alone . Therefore if't be thy will , Oh Lord , out of this world me for to take , Or else to send me some relief , even for thine own sweet mercies sake . Now mark the wonders of the Lord , what miracles were brought to pass Upon that aged Minister , [ and ] I will tell you how it was . The miracles are only these , that God in mercy hath restor'd , Him to his former strength again , and comfort does to him afford . His age seems now to be renew'd , as to the world if may appear , Though he before was almost deaf , he now can very well speak or hear . His [ e ] yes that were so dusk and dim , and also sunk into his head , Are now so quick and lively grown , that without spectacles he can read . And [ s ] ince his teeth were rotten out , there's new ones come in the old ones place His b [ r ] ows , and cheeks are fat and fair , wrinkls worn out of his face , And to be brief the limbs of his , are every one reviv'd again , From [ m ] head to foot from top to toe [ ? ] the world appears [ plain ] And [ worser n ] owe he do [ ? ] The old men life renewed by Heavenly providence .
