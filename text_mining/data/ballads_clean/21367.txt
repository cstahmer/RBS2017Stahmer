Loves lamentable Tragedy , When true Lovers prove unkind , Great sorrows they procure ; A and such strange pains the slighted find , That they cannot endure . To a Pleasant New Playhouse Tune . TEnder hearts of London City , now be moved with grief and pity , since by love I am undone ; Now I languish , in mine anguish , too too soon my heart was wone . By him I am strangely slighted , In whom I so long delighted , he unkindly shows disdain ; And my grief is past relief , alas ! my heart will break with pain Damon you my passion knew well , How then could you be so cruel ? first my heart to set on fire ; [ That ] en to leave me and deceive me , when I granted your desire . Come and see me as I'm lying , Bleeding for your sake and dying , yet my Ghost shall trouble you , When I depart , with broken heart , then all your comforts bid adieu . Thou shalt never be contented , But by night and day tormented since thou wertenberg so false to me : Ce [ lia ] dying thus lay crying , I will be a plague to thee . Down her cheeks the tears did trickle , Blaming Damon too too fickle ; till her tender heart was broke ; Discontented , thus she fainted , yielding to Death's fatal stroke . When this news to him was carried , [ A ] ll his joys were spoy'ld and marred , and his heart was filled with pain ; Still expressing , what a blessing , he had lost by his disdain . The Youngman's Answer . Oh! you powers be kind unto me , Else my sorrows will undo me , I am so perplexed in mind ; I denied her , and defied her , that was loving , chaste and kind . Now methinks I'm strangely daunted By her Ghost I shall be haunted , wheresoever I do go , I shall see her , mine own dear , since I wrought her overthrow , Thus he pausing stood , and thinking Looking as if he were sinking , while his countenance grew pale Death come ease me , quickly seize [ me ] for methinks my Spirits fai [ l ] . In his conscience he was wounded , And his senses were confounded , tears ran trickling from his Eye ; But his sorrow , pierced him thorough , then he vowed for love to die . Then his joints began to shiver , Straight he walks unto the [ r ] iiver there to built his watery Tomb , Often crying , and replying , Celia now I come , I come . FINIS .
