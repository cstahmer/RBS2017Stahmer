The Loyal Britain : Or , George for Ever YOur Laddy can't fight , but your Laddy may sing The scheme that he lays are in vain to be King , Such Helish Contrivances never shall bring , A Crown on the Head of your Laddy . In the midst of the Rebels in Dunkirk he stands , While King George's Forces do join Hand in Hand , We'll keep all such Rebels quite out of the Land , Both them and their Bastardly Laddy , His Plots are in Vain about England's Crown , While God has blessed us with a King of our own ; All Popish Pretenders we'll ever disown . So lightly we set by your Laddy . Our Laws and Religion we'll ever maintain , Both Pope and Pretender , we'll ever disdain , While Glorious King George does over Us Reign , We'll never have a Bastardly Laddy , Tho' France does threaten to Invade our Land , And furnish him with Men and Arms out of Hand , Thinking thereby to put Us to a stand ; By theratning Us with their Laddy , Their Plots and Conspiracies all are in Vain , No Popish Pretender shall over Us Reign , The House of Hanover we'll ever Maintain , And a Fig for their Cowardly laddy . They tell us he's Bred up a Proestant true , And fain would preswade Us the Crown is his endue , But who will regard such a Damnable Crew , Why , none but the Friends of the laddy , For each loyal Britain will join Hand in Hand , To fight for King George and obey his Command , Who up for our liberty firmly does stand , Against all Attempts of the laddy . So God bless King George and long may he Reign , For to be a Terror to Proud France and Spain , And prosper his Fleet on the Wattery Main , To give a home Stroke to their laddy I hope no Offence is in what is here Penn'd , To displease a true Britain , I did not intend , With Success to old England , my Song I shall end , And a Rope for the Friends of the laddy , The Loyal Britain : Or , George for Ever YOur Laddy can't fight , but your Laddy may sing The scheme that he lays are in vain to be King , Such Helish Contrivances never shall bring , A Crown on the Head of your Laddy .
