The Arraignment condemnation and execution of the grand [ cutpurse ] John Selman who was executed at White-hall upon Twesday the seventh of Jaunary . 1612 To the tune of a rich Merchant man . H Owe happy is that man . that in his b [ r ] east does bear : A [ ? ] st heart and in his heart , a perfect godly fear . A man so blessed I say , can no discomfort have , He shall not ta [ s ] tO a shameful death , to fi [ l ] l a [ tO ] im [ e ] less [ e ] grave . Could I of this before . have well and wisely thought : I would not have embraced the course this wamefull death hath brought . But all my mind was then , on idle wicked ways . To shift to gull , to cog and cheat , and so I spent my days . A multitude of thoughts , as black as hell it self , The Devil put into my heart , to compass worldly pelf . And many ways I used , both wicked base and foul , [ S ] till mindful of my body still , unmindful of my soul . In silk and velvets fair , I sometime used to go : As I had used the Merchants trade , forsuch I was in show . And at the worst I went , like one of good degree , And often used to change my suits . as needful I should see . So still I leaped untouched , till this presumptuous crime , This mounting sin for that revenge up to the Heavens did climb , Upon the blessed day , we celebrate the birth , O'th deer Redeemer of us all . with joy and Godlymirth : Within the house of God , and at the sacred hour , O'th blessed commanion I was touched , with Sathans damning power , In presence of the King , Whose majesty might make , A [ w ] fill intending were [ tO ] changed like me , to staggar faint and quake . This mischief vile I did , I picked a pocket there , Nor sacred person time nor place , could make me faintly fear , When all were at their prayers , and exercise divine , I pried about to get my prey , this devilish prey of mine , With hands and eyes to heaven , all did in reverence stand : While I in mischief used mine eye , and my accursed hand , Now was my mischief ripe . my villanyes full grown , And now the God in secret knew it . did make it open known . I could not shift it here , n [ y ] r no denial stand : For all hhe purse was newly took , it taken in my hand , And here I stand to pay , the price of that offence , God grant no christian after me , may such and act commence .

TO Hat men may fear the Acts , opugnant are to truth : I will anothamize the course , of lusty Selmans youth . His courses lewd and nought , the certain path of death : As in himself you well may see , who for them lost his breath . All labour he cast off , and all religious awe : To ireligious actions bent , making his will [ ? ] law : All company he used . that was profane and nought , And with them all the Arts of sin , he practised and wrought . With drunkerds heeed carouse , the wicked healths they use , And so , ( his understanding drowned ) would friend and foe abuse . As drunkerds use to do , the act is too too bad : There is small difference betwixt a man thats drunk and one thats mad . For both's but want of sense , which both a like do lack : And Godly unverstanding lost , the soul must needs to wrack . To this the killing sin , of lust he would annex : And with a boiling blood pursue , the sin o'th female sex . Counting their hell is heaven , dallying with their embrace : Enchanted with his harlots lip , died lock and painted face . with them heeed revel rout , the hours of day and night : Counting their pleasures all his jo [ y ] their sport his best delight , And thus will he consume , the substance that his friends : Had to him given to be employed , to good and thrifty ends . His stock on strumpets vile , thus wasted and decaide : To keep the flush of pleasure still : he fell tot'h cheaters trade . Sometime with tricks at cards , sometime with cogging Die : That he of purpose would prepare , to run too low or high . If all his wifts and tricks , would not prevail to win : Why there to this heeed add a worse and more presumptuous sin . Heeed get it out by oaths , swear and forswear apace : Without all fear of heaven or hell , or any thought of grace . Thus does one sin ( like waves ) run on another's neck : Unless ( by grace ) we can at first , our sinful nature check . And yet he stayed not here , but prog [ rest to ] his sins : To felony [ in ] [ bases ] tO kind , another's [ right to ] win . In change of [ gallant ] suits , with all the tO [ ? ] s belongs : Unto the cunning cutpurse craft , heeed follow crowds and throngs . There sometime cut a purse , sometime a pocket pick : In doing both he was a man , known very apt and quick . All cheaters cutpurses , and pickpurses he knew : And was as some report of him , the Captain of that crew : But for this sin on earth , he paid the bitter price : God grant by his example all , may learn to fly his vice .
