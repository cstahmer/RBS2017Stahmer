A New Song called Love in a Tub. To a new tune called Daniel Cooper . I. A Female Quaker in Cheap-side , She lov'd a presbyterian ; Her Husband she could not abide , Because he was not handsome . She having god a new great Tub , Which stood up in the Garrat ; Then on a day when he was out , Oh there she play'd the harlot . II In the mean while her Husband came , And cot them both together ; In the Tub they both were in , Where Presbyter embrace her : But when her Husband she did see , Oh she was soar amazed ; On one another they did look , And on him soundly gazed . III . Villain quoth he , why dost thou so , Dost think I will thee pardon ; Except a hundred pound I have , I'l bore thee not one Farthing . With that the Wigg , gave free consent , And paid him down the Money ; The Quaker with his Wife content , For playing with her Coney . FINIS .
