And Epitaph or mournful Memory upon the death of the right Honourable , the Lord Fraunics Russell , Earl of Bedford , Knight of the Noble Order of the Garter , and one of the Queens Majesties most honourable privy Counsel : who deceased the eight and twentie day of July . 1585. With a brief and lamentable Remembrance of the late and too untimely death of the Lord Russell , his Son , slain at Barwicke , by a traitorous Sco [ tt ] is Karle , on a day of True , the 27 of the same July . W Hat greater grief then loss of Noble Peers ' : Whose virtuous minds are pillars in distres Whose Counsel grave rid public weal from fears , Maintaining truth , supporting endless peace . Whose only care is such for to foresee , That all things may in perfect order be . What greater moan then where the Nobles wail ? the commons weep , the young and aged grieve : Where sorrows spring , where mirth and joy do quail , where nothing rests that may [ ? ] mind relieve , Where bliss to bane , where pleasure turned to pain , Yields mourning cheer instead of happy gain . No such distress , no such like deep despair , where Country , Prince , & amp ; court that erst were glad Are filde with woe , with ca [ r ] ke and woeful care , And forced ( perforce ) of sodden to be [ s ] ad : No such like pain , where scourge of daily smart , Torments the veins , and nips the woeful heart . [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ] [ Help ] [ ? ] acquaint this [ ? ] M [ use ] oh [ r ] [ m ? ] . Behold a sighed , all clad in mournful black , bewailing of the worthy Russels fallen : Whose wouted glee is chaungde to sodden wrack , whose [ would ] ppy state is mingled now with gall Whose grudging grief , so inwardly does gripe , That more and more their floods of tears wax ripe . Behold , a sighed , a piteous sighed to see , a peareles Court driven in a sodden maze : Casting their eyes where as the prince might be , as who would say , behold ) how we do gaze ? Behold alas , alack ) behold we say . Russell is gone , his corpse is shrind in clay . Far fled from us is our acquainted friend , the parcall fates have shred his thread in twaine , The Fortress of our solace now hath end , Our mourning weeds declare our pensive pain : He , he is gone , that was the lamp of light , In Council grave , much like the Sun beams bright . He , he is gone that was the courtly prize , that Bedford Earl , that noble minded wight : That Pearl , that Gem , most orient in our eyes , That godly , good , and most renowned Knight . That Earl in whom both God and man did joy , That man that was our riddance from annoy . That Lord that lent his ear unto the poor , whose pity was their Target still of proof , That Lord , that did increase their stock and store , That Lord , who , when he spied them stand a lose , Would call them near , and searching of their grief , Made ready way to give them deep relief . That Counceler , that loved his native land , h [ e ] , he it is that we alone lament : For when he lived , he lent his helping hand , to rich , to poor , to every men content : He , he is gone , the furtherer of good deeds : A pillar of love , a Sour of virtuous seeds . What he was thought and judged for to be , let Barwicke Town make memory of the same : His arts are known most fit for his degree , his deeds likewise are there inrolde with fame . For why , his wise and prudent government , The Scottish and the English did content . The West part , her , likewise did govern so , from time to time until his dying day : Maintaining right wherever he seemed to go , that no man could his dealings once gainsay . Justice he did in every point award , That was his care , and special chief regard . [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ] , Court , and [ ? ] Alas , what heart therefore would not relent , in mourning weed to see his Countess clad , His noble Son those passion to frequent , as makes all the household wondrous sad . His Servants here and there , as men aghast , So soon to see their gladness overcast . His Tenants , and his Neighbours all about , me thinks ( I hear ) how they do mourn and cry : Standing in fear , in dread , and double doubt , to whom that they their safety might apply . Who might their wrong in every point redress , And comfort them in cause of their distress . And rather since his good and godly Son , Lord Russell , too untimely erst was slain : Whose virtuous life , his father's steps begun , whose zealous mind pure conscience did maintain . Whose heart , and hand , whose honour still did grow , To the praise of God , and help of man bel [ owe ] e . And yet ( alas ) upon the day of True , in service of his Sovereign loyal Queen : Preferring his assured duty due , in Scotland there , midst chieftains to be seen , A Earl , a Scot , a wretch devoid of care , A bare-thrid Groom his ruin did prepare Since then this loss to England is befall , and that the Court eclipsed is so soar : Come Gentles come , come forth like mourners all : help to the ground , bring his corpse therefore . Help he that cam , to spread his praise at large , Deserts require that this may be your charge . Exclaim of right , set your Invectives down , Declare against the fatal Sisters three : Let royal verse rove round about the Town , to show how much dispightfull they might be : And maugre all the cankered hate they bear , Let your good will for quittance right appear . Say thus with me ( dire Death ) thy worst is done , thy malice shown , the Triumph yet but small . From youth to age , Russell such fame hath won , as that his praise lives honoured all in all . His virtue such , such like good will hath god , That Envy can his Honour never blot . And though that thou ( vild death ) hast battered down , the Tower strong , and Castle of our joy : Think while he lived , to sovereign Prince & amp ; Crown , for their relief , his care he did [ ? ] oye : To no end else but that the [ ? ] [ mig ] ht know , What duty to his Country he did owe . [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ] Among the Sa [ int ] s that evermore art [ ? ] . Thy Padgeant played , thy faithful cry is herd : thy hope in Christ was Anchor of thy hold : Whereby to thee his promise is not barred , but takes deep root in thee ten hundred fold . Farewell the light , and Loadstar of our bliss , The rich may live , the poor thy help shall miss . Yet on thy Shrine , let these few Poems stand , Here lies the salve that healed the poor men grief : Here lies that good and bounteous liberal hand , That day by day was furnished with relief : Here lies the Lord , the Councelour & amp ; the Knight , That ever gave his Country perfect light . Here lies the heart much like the heart of Oak , Here lies the branch of Olive fresh and green , That never weighed or cared for Envies stroke , Such were his fruits continual to be seen : Here lies the Earl , God grant him endless rest , By whose good mean , little England hath been blessed . FINIS . N.B. Imprinted at London , for Hen - rye Car , and are to be should in Paules Churchyard , at the sign of the blazing Star .
