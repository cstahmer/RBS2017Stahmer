Englands Great Prognosticator , Foretelling when England shall enjoy a settled peace and happiness again , Not by Planets , Signs , nor by Stars , But truly tells when ends these bloody wars . To the Tune of , When the King enjoys his own again . WHat Booker can Prognosticate Concerning of our Kingdoms fate ? I think my self to be as wise As most that gazes in the Skies my skill goes beyond the depth of Pond , Or Rivers in the greatest rain , by which I can tell all things will be well , Now the King enjoys his own again . There's neither Swallow , Dove , nor Dade , Can soar more high , nor deeper wade , To give you a reason from the Stars , What causeth Peace , or Civil wars , the man in the Moon , may wear out his shoes , In cunning after Charls his wane , and all to no end , for the times they will mend , Now the King enjoys his own again . Though for a time you saw White-hall , With cobwebs hanging on the wall , Instead of Silk and silver brave , As formerly it us'e to have , in every room , the sweet perfume Delightful for a Princely train , the which you may see , now the time it shall be , That the King is come home in peace again . Full forty years the Royal Crown , Hath been his Father's , and his own , And is there any more than be , Hath right unto that Sovereignty ? then who better may the Sceptre sway , Than he that hath such right to reign the hope's of our peace for the wars will cease , Now the King is come home in peace again . Till when , Ararat upon thy Hill , My hope's did cast her Anchor still , Until I saw some peaceful Dove , Bring home that branch which dear I love , till then I did wait , the waters abate , Which most disturb'd my troubled brain , and never did rejoice , till I did hear the voice , That the King enjoys his own again . Oxford and Cambridge still agree , Crown'd with honour and dignity . Learned men shall now take place , Tub-men be silenc'd with disgrace , for they shall know 'twas but and outward show That they so long disturb'd their brain , so I can tell that all things will be well Now the King is come home in peace again . CHurch Government shall settled be , And then I hope we shall agree , Without their helps whose hair-brain'd zeal , Hath long disturb'd the Commonweal , Green's out of date , and the Cobbler does prate , Of whimsies that disturbs his brain , the which you shall see , when the time it shall be , Now the King enjoys his own again . Though many men are much in debt , And diverse shops are to be let , A golden time is drawing near , Men shall want shops for their ware , all Trades shall increase by the means of a Peace The which ere long we shall obtain , for which I can tell all things will be well , Now the King enjoys his own again . Maidens shall enjoy their Mates , And honest men their lost estates , Women shall have what they do lack , Their husbands are a coming back when the wars have and end , then I and my friend , A Subject's freedom shall obtain , for this I can tell , all things will be well Now the King enjoys his own again . People shall walk without any fear , About the Country every where . Thieves shall tremble at the Law , And Justice keep them all in awe , Papists shall fly , with their trumpery And then a fig for Room and Spain , the which you shall see , when the time it shall be , Now the King is come home in peace again . The Parliament most willing be , That all the world may plainly see , Now they do labour still for Peace , That all these bloody wars may cease , for they will spend their lives to defend The King in all his rights to reign , so I can tell , all things will be well , Now the King enjoys his own again . When all these things to pass shall come , Then farewell Musket , Pike , and Drum , The Lamb shall with the Lion feed , That were a happy time indeed , Oh let all pray , that we may see the day , That Peace may govern Charles his Wane , for then I can tell , all things will be well Now the King enjoys his own again .
