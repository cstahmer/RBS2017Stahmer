NEar Golford Town , we hear , Of late in Gloucestershire , There liv'd a Lady fair , of Beauty bright ; Her Father vastly great , In Money and Estate , Which most unfortunate , ruin'd her quite . [ Two tO ] housand pounds a Year , [ Her Fath ] er had , we hear , [ There was ] no other Heir , [ But this ] Lady ; Who'd marry her outright , Unto a Rich Old Knigh But she the same did slight disdainfully . Father , she often cry'd , If that I should be ty'd To be and Old Man's Bride , How would this prove ? If in Marriage Band Must obey your Command , Let me , Sir , have a Man , that I can love , Her Father angry grew , Saying , Daughter , if you Will my Commands not do , to pleasure me , Assured be of this , If that you wed amsis Unto my Mind , I'll dis - inherit thee . For some time this passed on , And a young Gentleman , That lived near at hand , a wooing came . One thousand Pounds a Year , His Father had w [ e ] hear , And he his only Heir unto the same . When to her Father come , His Business he made known , For whose dear Sake alone , he him addressed . Sir , if you'll give , he cry'd , Your Daughter for my Bride , Sure no Man e'er beside , can be more blessed . Her Father cunningly , Did make him this Reply , Your Suit I'll not deny , get her in Mind : But when they'd fi their Love Before the Powers xbove , I'ld them he false did prove , as you will find . When some few Months , alas ; In Courtship they had passed , Their Hearts were linked fast , in lasting Love . Cupid had played his Part , And sent a flaming Dart , To wound each others Heart , which none could move . But see the wretched Fate Of cruel Father's Hate : He strove to separate [ them you shall hear , ] And would not yield , he said , Though he had promised this Gentleman should wed his Daughter fair . prey Sir , he often cry'd , Why must I be deny'd , Of this my charming Bride , I so much love I that unkind you are , To part us loving Pair , We're ruin'd I declare ; then kinder prove . Her Father did say , Think you [ y ] oung Man I pray , That I will throw away my Daughter so ? Her Fortune is too great , For one of your Estate , ; Therefore stand not to prate . my Mind you know . Then in great Discontent , He to his Lady went , And sadly did lament this his hard Case . Saying , Dear Lady bright , I'm ruined , ruin'd quite , Your Father does me slight , and proves most base . He'll not consent he cry'd , That you should be my Bride , Oh! What will me betide ? I am undone . Now I have fix'd my Love , He most unkind does prove ; Pity , you Powers above , a poor young Man. Then did he sadly weep , Grieving and sighing deep , And at his Lady's Feet , fell in a Swooned : This griev'd her to the Heart , Of Love she felt the Smart , As in the ensuing part , will soon be found , When thus , this Lady fair Beheld her Lover dear , She us'd her utmost Care him to revive ? And often , often cry'd , If I am you deny'd , I'll have not One beside , as I'm alive . Then did the Tears apace , Run trickling down her Face , And him did oft embrace , [ upon the Floor , ] Wretched Father , said she , Is this your Love to me ? I shall now ruin'd be for evermore . As from his Swoon he came , With a deep Sighs and Groan , He cry'd , Undone , Undone , my Dear , am I . My Love is just and true , And if I have not you , I'll bid the World adieu Eternally . These Words she did express , My Love is nothing less , I freely must confess , it is most true . But if my Father , he , Will not to it agree , I cannot marry'd be , dear Sir , to you . I will most constant prove , No other will I love ; Witness you Gods above to what is said . But cease for to lament , And strive to be Content ; For without his Consent I will not wed . When she these Words did speak He sigh'd as Heart would break Saying , Love , for your sake , ruin'd am I . I'll say no more than this Give me one parting Kiss : Now farewell Earthly Bliss Eternally . Then from her he did go , With a Heart fill'd with Woe , To work his Overthrow resolvedly . Some Poison strong he took , Which quickly did its Work ; so he this world forsook most wretchedly . When this News to her came , She griev'd much for the same . And said he was to blame himself to kill . She to her Father ran , And cry'd , Oh cruel Man , See , see what you have done , by your ill will . Like one Distracted , she Lamented bitterly , And said , My Dear , with thee [ Would I had died . ] Declare if now I shall , I'm ruin'd by your Fallen ; I lov'd you more than all the World beside . Thus Day and Night she cry , My Love , why did you die , And leave me wretchedly behind you here ; O come dear Ghost to me , And let me once more see , That comely Face , said she , I love'd so dear . As she one Night did lie , Weeping most bitterly , She herd a Voice to cry , my Dear , my Dear , For your sweet sake I dy'd , Who should have been my Bride Behold at your Bed's side ; I'm here , I'm here . At which the Curtain she Put back immediately , And the pale Ghost did see At her Bed's side . It clothed was in White , Holding a Torch so Bright ; At this most dismal Sighed she shrick'd and cry'd . The Ghost then thus did speak , I died for your sake , 'Twas love my Heart did break most certainly : The Morning Cock I fear , Won't let me long stay here , Then if you love me ; Dear - est follow me . The Ghost a Dead-mans Skull Did hold , with Poison still , Saying come drink your fill , of this black Cup ; 'twill lovesick Passion cure , I've drank the same before ; And so has Hundreds more ; then take it up . She took it , saying Lo [ we , ] By all the Gods above , this shall my Witness prove I love you well ; Now will I go she said , And in your grave be laid ; In sweet Elizans-Shades , our Souls shall dwell . She instantly arose , Surrounded all with Woes , And with the Ghost she goes , [ down to the Gate ; ] Whereas a Coach did stand . With many a Serving Man , With torches in their Hand that their did wait . Being put in the Coach , With her beloved Ghost , Most swiftly they did post , unto his Grave : and said , Love here i lie , then quickly , quickly die , to which he straight did high , 'tis that I'd have . Vanishing all away , they left her there to stay , till the approaching Day . among the tombs ; She sadly did Lament , Her Cries to Heaven sent , And said , Ghost be content , I'll come , ill come . The Poison wrack'd her Heart Working in every part , Death with his fatal Dart the Wound had gave , in woeful Misery , she did expecting lie , Each Minute for die , upon his Grave . As in this state she lay , Until the silent Day , Youngman passed that way A and her did know ; Fair Lady to me tell , What chance has you befell , I fear all is not well , that you lie so . Then she declar'd what passed From first unto the last And said Young man make haste and run with speed Unto my Father Dear , who have been so severe , Oh bik him quick come here e'er I am Dead . Her Father came and found Her lying on the Ground , And ready was to swoon at this sad sighed , She cry'd dear Father I , For Love now here must die 'Tis your Severity has kill'd me quite [ , ] Death wracks in e [ very ] P [ lace , ] And stares me in that [ e face ; ] Dear Grave , I'll [ thee embrace so lovingly . ] Dear Lo [ we , now open wide ] thy Arms for thy [ dear Bride ; ] I come , I come , she [ cr ] y'd , and so did die , Her Father grieving soar , Hugging her o'er and oar , You Heavens i implore Let me too die , then with a Dagger sharp He struck him to the Heart , His Life did there depart immediately .
