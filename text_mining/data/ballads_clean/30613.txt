For all the gold that Cresus e'er did own , I will [ l ] not seem to leave my Love alone ; No , no , my Love , I will not prove untrue , Nor will I change and old Friend for a new . Thou shalt not need to turn a Palmer poor , For I for thee have gold and silver store ; Instead of finding out some secret place , Thou shalt have me within thy arms t'imbrace ; Thou shalt not travel to another land , For i'l [ l ] be ready still at thy c [ oh ] mmand : TO [ h ] ou shalt my Dear have not cause to complain , For I with joy thy love will entertain .

If thou wertenberg on the roaring Sea so wide , Upon the Dolphins back then thou may'st ride : Desiring Neptune's favour out of hand , To be your Pilot to some other Land. Sweet Love abroad much dangers do ensue , The Seas and Wilderness bids thee adieu ; Ne'er seek to write , nor think of wind and tide , But live with me and I will be thy Bride . O stay at home my Love and go not there , Wild beasts in pieces will thy body tear : When I behold them for to suck thy blood , They shall have mine ; my Love , to do thee good . Lo thus to thee , my Love , I do make known , Vowing hereafter I will be thy own : Oh stay thy hand , my Love , and do not kill Thy gentle heart , which I do love so well . Then straight he took his Love into his arms , That had preserv'd his body from such harms , Welcome , quoth he , I lov [ e ] thee as my life And quickly after he made her his Wife .
