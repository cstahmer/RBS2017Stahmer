The Jealous old Dotard : OR , The Discovery of Cuckoldry : A Pleasant New Song . Old Men beware when you young Wenches wed , lest Lusty Gallants do ascend your Bed ; And horn your palsie-pates , for Youthful Blood Fair Venus's pastime never yet withstood : 'Tis fit that all old Men should Cuckolds be , Who think young women Love a sapless Tree . To a pleasant new Tune . Whither art thou going my old man ? my old man , I will call him my Lamb , And whither art thou going my sweet old man ? my sweetest man alive ? To the Alehouse you Who ---- When wilt thou come home my old man , my old man ? I will call him my Lamb ; And when wilt thou come home my sweet old man , my sweetest man alive ? At night you Slut ---- What wilt thou have for Supper my old man , my old man ? I will call him my Lamb ? & what wilt thou have for supper my sweet old man , my sweetest man alive ? Eggs you Who ---- Where shall I boil them my old man , my old man ? I will call him my Lamb , And where shall I boil them my sweet old man , my sweetest man alive ? In the Furnace you Slut -- How many wilt thou have my old man , my old man ? I will call him my Lamb ; And how many wilt thou have my sweet old man , my sweetest man alive ? A thousand you Who ---- I fear they will surfeit thee my old man , my old man , I will call him my Lamb ; I fear they will surfeit thee my sweet old man , my sweetest man alive .

Cause i'le be bury'd you Who --- And where wilt thou be bury'd my old man , my old man ? I will call him my Lamb ; And where wilt thou be bury'd my sweet old man , my sweetest man alive ? In the Chimney-corner you Slut --- Why wilt thou be bury'd there my old man my old man ? I will call him my Lamb , Why wilt thou be bury'd there my sweet old man , my sweetest man alive ? Cause i'le hear the Pot boil you Who -- Why art thou so cross my old man , my old man ? I will call him my Lamb ; Why art thou so cross my sweet old Man , my sweetest man alive ? 'Cause you Cuckold me you Slut - [ -- ] Leave off your jealousy my old man , my old man , I will call him my Lamb ; Leave off your jealousy my sweet old man , my sweetest old man alive : I am Horn-mad you Who --- O pray say not so my old man , my old Man I will call him my Lamb : O pray say not so my sweet old man , my sweetest Man alive : I know its true you Slut - [ -- ] Who told you of it my old man , my old man I will call him my Lamb ; Who told you of it my sweet old Man , my sweetest old man alive : I peep'd through the Keyhole you Wh - [ -- ] Alas but with who my old man , my old man , I will call him my Lamb : Alas but with who my sweet old man , my sweetest old man alive : With a nimble Weaver you Slut - [ -- ] He's young and lusty my old Man , my old man I will call him my Lamb ; He's young and lusty my sweet old man , my sweetest old man alive : Why am not I so too you Slut - [ -- ] No you're e'n sapless , my old man , my old man I will call him my Lamb ; No you're e'n sapless my sweet old man , my sweetest old man alive : And must I be horn'd for't you Wh [ oh --- ] Yes , I can't help it , my old man , my old man I will call him my Lamb ; Yes , I can't help it my sweet old man , my sweetest old man alive : Then all the Town shall know't you Slut - [ -- ] FINIS .
