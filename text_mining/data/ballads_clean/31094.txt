COME buy my New Ballad , I have't in my Wallet , Though 'twill not , I fear , please every Palate : Then mark what ensu'th , For I swear by my Youth , That every Line in my Ballad is Truth : A Ballad of Wit , a brave Ballad of Worth , 'Tis newly Printed and newly come Forth . 'Twas made of a Cloak that fell out with the Gown , That cramp'd all the Kingdom and crippl'd the Crown . Ill tell you in Brief A Story of Grief That happen'd when Cloak was Commander in Chief : It tore Common-Pray'rs , Imprison'd Lord Mayors , In one Day it voted down Prelates and Play'rs , It made People perjur'd in Point of Obedience , And the Cov'nant did cut off the Oath of Allegiance . Then let us endeavour to pull the Cloak down , That cramp'd , etc It was a Black Cloak , In good Time be it spoke It kill'd many Thousands , but never struck Stroke ; With Hatchet and Rope , The forlorn Hope , It join'd with the Devil to pull down the Pope ; It set all the Sects in the City to Work , And rather than fail 'twould have brought in the Turk . Then let us Endeavour , etc It Seiz'd on the Tow'r Guns , Those fierce Demi-gorgons , It set up the Bagpipes , but pull'd down the Organs , The Pulpits did Smoke , Our church it did Choke , And all our Religion was turned to a Cloak ; It brought in lay Elders could not Write or Read : It set public Faith up , but pull'd down the Creed ; Then let us endeavour , etc This Pious Impostor Such Fury did Foster , It left us no Penny nor no Pater Noster ; It threw to the Ground Ten Commandments down' And set up twice Twenty Times Ten of its own : It routed the King and Villains elected To plunder all those whom they thought Disaffected Then let us Endeavour , etc To blind Peoples Eyes This Cloak was so Wise , It took off Ship Money , but set up Excise : Men brought in their Plate For Reasons of State And gave it to Tom Trumpet and his Mate : In Pamphlets it wrote many specious Epistles To Cozen poor Wenches of Bodkins and Whistles . Then let us Endeavour , etc In Pulpits it moved , And was much Approved For Crying out , Fight the [ Lord' ] s Battles beloved ; It Bobtail'd the Gown , Pull'd Prelacy down , It trodden on the Mitre to reach at the Crown ; And into the Field it and Army did bring To aim at the Council but shoot at the King . Then let us Endeavour , etc It raised up States Whose Politic Pates Do now keep their Quarters on our City Gates ; To Father and Mother To Sister and Brother It gave a Commission to kill one another : It took up Men's Horses at very low Rates And Plunder'd our Goods to see [ c ] ure our Estates Then let us Endeavour , etc This Cloak did proceed To a Damnable Deed , It made the best Mirror of Majesty Bleed : Tho' Cloak did not do't It set it on Foot By rallying and calling his Jou [ r ] ney Men to' For never had come such a bl [ oh ] ody Disaster If Cloak had not first drawn a Sword at his Master . Then let us Endeavour , etc Tho some of 'em went hence By sorrowful Sentence , This lofty long Cloak is not mov'd to Repentance ; But he and his Men , Twenty Thousand times Ten , Are Plotting to do their Tricks over again : But let this proud Cloak to Authority stoop , Or Catch will provide him a Button and Loop , For we'll ever endeavour , etc Come buy my new Ballad , I have't in my Wallet , But 'twill not I fear please every Pala Then mark what ensu'th , I swear by my youth , That every line in my Ballad is truth : A Ballad of wit , a brave Ballad of worth : 'Tis newly printed , and newly come forth .
