Loves Mistress : Or Nature's Rarity . To a most Excellent Delicious New Tune : called Tell me the wandering Spirits in the Air . TO Ell me you wandering Spirits in the Air , When that you saw oh Nymph more bright more fair Then Beauty's Darling ( wheresoever she fly ) Or twinck [ l ] ing Comets in the Starry Skies : If in this world a Phoenix may be found , It's she , whose grace must and shall be Crowned . O! call her from the fair Elizium Bay And tell her how my senses fade away , For in her being was my fired state , But she's dissolved my time is out of date She's flown unto the Azure Skies , Then cry , then cry , Amintas for her absence dies . Turn sa [ c ] read Nymph , restore my la'est breath , That [ at ] am designed for untimely death , This she can cure me with her glorious looks Without the skill of Doctors or their Books , Then let thy beauty with such splender shine , to raise , to raise , this drooping Lovesick heart of mine . Search , search the Valleys , where the Vestal Train , And Shepherdesses in their state remain : Walk through the Woods , & amp ; view the Myrtle Groves Where Lov [ e ] s Queen rangeth with her Turtle Doves , She's like fair Venus in her glorious Rays , Then Crown her , Crown her , with a wreathe of Royal Bays . Walk through the Ga [ r ] den , view the WORSER [ a ] mask Rose , And smell that scent those precious leaves enclose : It's her sweet breath that gives this odorous smell , And Peerless Virtue ( richly does ex [ c ] e [ l ] ) If there you see one like the Radiant Sun , It's she , it's she , whom I adore , Loves Paragon . O taste the Fountains silver streaming Springs , And Hellicon where Lady-Muses sings , Distil the Sea , wade through the Ocean deep , She may there be Tombed in eternal sleep : But she's conveyed from every mortal Eye , Oh Cloris , Cloris , come away , or else I die . Sea [ r ] changed , search the Rocks where sire's sing their charm She may be lulled in their Enchanting arms , Fish , fish , for P [ e ] arls and [ worser ] you may Corals find , Or else a Jewel to content the mind : My bliss my joys are turned to destiny , That I , that I , must die for loving thee . S [ c ] ale high Olimpus where the gods remain , And goddesses with all their Royal Train , View perfectly the Spangled Orb ' and see If Cloris Cloris , be in R [ oh ] yalty : She's gone , she's gone , whilst I in torments fry , Oppressed , oppressed with pain , fain would but cannot die . [ S ] earch every quarter of the World and see If Nature's piece , so excellent there be : Turn round the Globe , and view each Centre right , If there you find one like to Phoebus bright With lustrious beauty , shining in extremes , It's she , it's she , Eclipsing Luna with her Beams . O stay a while , I may inform you ill , Were she on Earth she had been with me still , Fly , Fly to Heaven examine every Sphere , And see what Stars are lately fixed there . If any brighter then the Sun you see fallen down , fallen down and honour her , for that is she . Printed for F. Coles T. Vere . J. Wright and J. Clarke . Loves Mistress : Or Nature's Rarity .
