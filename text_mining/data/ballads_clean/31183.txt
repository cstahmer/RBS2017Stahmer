A Delectable [ New BALLAD , ] ENTITLED , Leader-Haughs and Yarow . To its own Proper Tune . WHen PHOEBUS bright , the Azure Skies with golden rays enlighteneth These things Sublunar he espies ; [ Herbs , Trees ] and Plants he quick'neth : Among all though [ se he ] makes [ his choice , ] And gladly goes he thorough , With Radiant Beams , and Silver streams , Through Leader-Haughs and [ Yarow . ] When Aries , tO [ he ] day and night [ In ] equal length divides , Old [ frosty ] Saturn takes the flight , No longer he abideth : Then Flora Queen , with Mantle green , Casts off her former sorrow , And vows to dwell with Caeres fell In Leader Haughs and Yarow . Pan playing on his Oaten reed , with Shepherds him attending , Does here resort their flocks to feed , The Hill , and Haughs commending : With bottle , bag , and staff with knag , and all singing good Morrow , They swear no Fields more pleasure yields , Then Leader Haught and Yarow . One House there stands on [ Led ] er side Surmounting my descryving , With Ease rooms rair , and Windows fair , Like Daedalus contriving : Men passing by , do often say In South it has no marrow ; It stands as fair on Leader side As Newwark does on Yarow A mile below , who list to ride , They'l hear the Mavis singing , Into St. Leonards bank she'l bide , Sweet Birks her head o'r hinging : The Lint white loud , and progne proud , With tender throats and narrow , Into St. Leonards banks do sing As sweetly as in Yarow . The Lapwing lilteth o'r the Lie , With nimble wings she sporteth , But vows she'l not come near the Tree Where philomel resorteth : By break of day , the Lark can say , I'e bid you all good morrow , I'le yout and yell , for I may dwell In Leader Haughs and Yarow . Parke , wanton walls , and wooden cleugh , The East and Wester Mainses , The Forest of Lawder's fair enough , The Corns are good in blanslies ; Where Oats are fine and sold by kind , That if you search all thorough Mearns , buchan , Marr , none better are , Then Leader Haughs and Yarow . In burn Milne boge , and whitstead Shawes , The fearful Hare she haunteth , Bridge haugh and broad wood shiel she knaws To the chapel wood frequenteth : Yet when she irks , to Kaidstie Birks , She runs and sighs for sorrow , That she should leave sweet Leader Haughs And cannot win to Yarow . What sweeter Music would you hear , The [ n hounds and Bieglies crying , ] The [ Hare waits not but flees for fe ] are , [ their hard pursuit defying , ] [ But yet her strength it fails ] at length , [ no bielding can she ] borrow , [ At Haggs Clockmas nor ] Sortlesfield [ but longs to ] be at Yarow , [ For Rackwood , Ringwood ] Rival , Aymer , [ still thinking ] for [ to ] view her , [ But O! to fail her strength ] begins , [ no cu ] nning can rescue her : O'er [ du ] bbe and dike , o'r seugh and syke , She'l run the fields all thorough , Yet ends her days in Leader Haughs , And bids farewell to Yarow . Thou Ersington and Colden knows , Where Humes had once commanding , And Dry Grange with thy milk white Ewes , 'Twixt Tweed and Leader standing : The Birds that flees through Rid path trees And Gledswood banks all thorough , May Chant and Sing , sweet Leader Haughs , And the bony Banks of Yarow . But BURN cannot his grief assuage , While as his days endureth , To see the Changes of this Age , Which day and time procureth ; For many a place stands in hard case . Where Burns were blithe beforrow , With Humes that dwelled on Leader side , And Scots that dwelled in Yarow . The words of BURN the Violer . What ? shall my Violent silent be , or leave her wonted Scriding ? But choice some sadder Elegy , Not Sports and Mirds deriding : It must be feign with lower strain , Then it was wont beforrow , To found the praise of Leader Haughs , And the bony Banks of Yarow . But floods has overflown the Banks , The greenish Haughs disgracing , And Trees in Woods grows thin in ranks About the fields defacing : For Waters waxes , Woods do wained ; More , if I could for sorrow , In rural verse , I could rehearse , Of Leader Haughs and Yarow . But sighs and sobs o'rsets my breath , Soar saltish tears forth sending , All things Sublunar here on Earth Are subject to and ending : So must my Song , though some what long , Yet late at even and Morrow , I'le sighs and sing , sweet Leader Haughs , And the bony Banks of YAROW .
