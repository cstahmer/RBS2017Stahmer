Household Talk , OR ; Good Council for a Married Man. Delivered in a Pretty Dialogue , By Roger a Bachelor , to Simon , A ( Jealous ) Married-man . To the Tune of Buckle and Thong-a . Simon . NEighbour Roger woe is me , I am sorely discontented , No redress at all I see , more and more I am tormented , Night and Day , I pine away . While my dearest friends do scoff me , to my face they ( boldly ) say , My Cousin makes a Cuckold of me . Roger . Neighbour Simon be not sad , let not Passion oversway thee , If thy Wife will be so bad , that in such false coin shee'le pay thee , Why therefore , Shouldst thou deplore , Or wear stockings that are yellow , tush be blithe ( man ) grieve no more , A Cuckold is a good men fellow . Simon . Ah , how can I choose but be , griev'd and vexed out of measure , When with mine own eyes I see , him a Rival in my pleasure , With soar sobs , My bosom throbs When I hear my Neighbours scoff me , of all joy my heart it robs , My Cousin makes a Cuckold of me . Roger . Jealousie's a mad disease , and upon the brain it works ; Like tormenting Lice or Fleas , it in secret corners lurks , But that he , Who ere he be , Shows himself in wit but shallow , to be vexed with Jealousy , A Cuckold is a good men fellow . Simon . This a saying long ago , us'd by those that know it truly , Every man can tame a Shroe , but he who hath a wife unruly , And he that wears , The Shoe declares , Best where it wrings him : do not scoff me , this report still fills mine ears , My Cousin makes a Cuckold of me . Roger . Tush , then it seems this bore report , not apparent by Probation , Neighbour I am sorry for't , that on such a weak foundation , You should frame , Such a Fame , Of your wife , 'tis nought I tell you , yet suppose she were to blame , A Cuckold is a good men fellow . Simon . Alas deer neighbour you mistake , 'tis not on mere supposition , That I this relation make , I have grounds for my suspicion , He and she , So agree , That unto my face they scoff me , any man may easily see , My Cousin makes a Cuckold of me . Roger . Presuppose that all be true , ( as I hardly can believe it , ) Yet it is but vain for you , in the worst sense to conceive it , I dare say , ( As I may ) It's but flames some Gossips tell you , yet if she have gone astray , A Cuckold is a good men fellow . The second Part , To the same Tune . Simon . Truly neighbour Roger now , I perceive that you are leaning , To defend ( if you knew how ) the knave and quean , I find your meaning , I suppose , Y'are one of those , That behind my back will scoff me , now I find the game how't goes , My Cousin makes a Cuckold of me . Roger . Jealous Coxcomb leave thy prate , do not thus bewray thy folly , If Cornuting be thy fate , be not mad with Melancholy , I do scorn , To suborn , He , or She in vice to wallow , yet I'de have thee hide thy horn , A Cuckold is a good men fellow . Simon . Neighbour Roger when you come , into th' row of neighbours married , I believe you'le not be dumb , if things be no better carried , Then they be , Now with me , Far and near the people scoff me , like you I wish that I were free . My Cousin makes a Cuckold of me . Roger . Neighbour Sim I do not know , what my Fate may be in choosing ; But if I 'ere come i'th' row , I'me resolv'd not to be musing , Whither she , Be true to me , I will not show my self so shallow , for if I be like to thee , A Cuckold is a good men fellow . Simon . Honest Roger by my troth , thou hast given me satisfaction , From henceforth upon my oath , ( unless I take them in the actium ) I will not My self besot , With Jealousy that made some scoff me , yet 'twill hardly be forgotten , My Cousin makes a Cuckold of me . Roger . Prithee Sim forget it quite , think thy wife is constant to thee , This is one thing , mark it right , many good turns it will do thee , If thou seek , Her use to break , Rather strive to stop a Billow of the Sea ; tush never speak , A Cuckold is a good men fellow . Simon . Now I am resolv'd to'th full , never more I will be Jealous , Nor will I mistrust my Scull , I'll be merry with good fellows , Home I'll high , By and by , Kiss my Wife ( with due submission ) thanks sweet Roger heartily , For thy wholesome admonition .
