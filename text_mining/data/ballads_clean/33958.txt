( 271 ) THE HUE -- and -- SONG AFTER PATIENCE . Have but a little PATIENCE , and you shall hear , How PATIENCE had the Gift to Lie and Swear ; How PATIENCE cou'd with PATIENCE stand a Lie , ( But PATIENCE wants to stand the PILLORY . ) Out of PATIENCE , to the Hague He steers : To stay He had not PATIENCE , for his Ears . To the Tune of : Hail to the Myrtle shade . I . HAil to London fair Town , All hail to the Mayor & the Shrievs ; Hail to the Scarlet Gown , Whose Sentence our Patience grieves : Justice and Law has prevail'd , With PATIENCE a Verdict to find , 'Gainst Patience , whose conscience fail'd ; O Patience ! why art so blind ; II PATIENCE , the joy of the Town , The comfort and hope of the Crowd ; PATIENCE , who god Renown , By Perjury , Lies and Fraud : PATIENCE who ne'r had the Heart His Sovereign's Rights to maintain ; But PATIENCE he had the Art To Swear and Forswear again . III . PATIENCE for Church and State , And Patience for Meetings by stealth ; PATIENCE , who wou'd translate The State to a Commonwealth : Whose Zeal has his Patience betray'd , To lie for the Saints in distress ; Nay , Tho' he's Forsworn , ( 'tis said , ) He Swore he could do no less . IV. PATIENCE , whose Zeal did contrive The Monument Figures and Spire , That while there's a Papist alive We may not forget the Fire : The Pillory now is his Lot , He has rais'd such a flame with his Crew , That London is now too hight ; O Patience ! where art thou now ; V. PATIENCE , for Zeal to the Cause Did preach to Captives in Gaol ; PATIENCE , with great applause , Gave large to and Hospital : To Use now his Money may lend , For Pomfret he never must stand , Nor Warrants for Thompson send , For Titus o' th' Perjur'd Band , VI . PATIENCE , with Collar of Brass , To woeful Disasters did fallen ; PATIENCE , with Copper Face , And a Conscience worse than all ; To Holland , to Holland he goes , For plainly now it appears , That in spite of the Whiggish Cause , Their Shams will not save his Ears . VII . Some say , that the Saints may not sweet [ ear ] But lie ev'n as much as they can ; Yet PATIENCE , in spite on's Ear Will Swear , and Forswear again : That PATIENCE shou'd be so far los [ ? ] Alas ! who with Patience can hear [ ? ] That a Saint shou'd be Knight o' th' P [ ? ] And and Elder without and Ear . VIII . Let ev'ry good Subject , with Me [ ? ] ( Who PATIENCE a Virtue do [ ? ] Lest he fallen into PERJURY , With PATIENCE pray for Grace But now I with PATIENCE have dONE [ e ] Lest with Patience I keep such a Ro [ ? ] That all astray with PATIENCE run And weary your PATIENCE out .
