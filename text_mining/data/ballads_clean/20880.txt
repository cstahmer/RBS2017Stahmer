[ So ] they god up on horseback , to Room for to ride , [ And ] God bless great William that turned the tide [ He ] kicked those old Massmongers quite out of door , [ With ] th a downfall for ever to Babylons whore : [ A ] and now popery's banished as all men may see , [ In ] the crowning of William and brave Queen Marry . And though Priests and Jesuits look black and sad , Like that lion in the Tower , we'll make them all mad : for our Lords and good Commons , beyond all compare , Will send them strait packing to Coleman is old Mare . While our Bonfires shall burn with Huzas to the Sky , In the crowning of William and brave Queen Marry . Then let's spare for no cost , since the day is our own , And great William and Marry right Heirs to the Throne Who throughout the Nation hath popery pulled down ; Then bid they thrice welcome to Englands brave Crown , Let the Conduits run wine and the Bells' ring for joy , In the crowning of William and brave Queen Marry . For a Protestant King and a Protestant Queen , The like in old England long time hath not been ; 'Twill make Monsieur French-man his heart for to ache , for fear lest great William his Kingdom should shake : For we'll venture our lives and fortune's most free , In the crowning of William and brave Queen Marry . This God that that wrought us this Miracle great , for to settle old England in Church and in State : With wisdom & amp ; knowledge God bless our good King , In all his undertakings in every thing ; That in health , peace and plenty long life we may see By the crowning of William and brave Queen Marry . Now once more our good old laws established will be , By House , Lords , and Commons , and Parliament free . Then God bless all the Nobility of the land , That for true Religion so steadfast did stand ; And have acted so firmly in Parliament free , For the crowning of William and brave Queen Marry . And now let us pray that they still may agree , Without disquiet of Conscience in free liberty [ y ] The glory of England once more for to raise , And confirm the laws of Elizabeths days .
