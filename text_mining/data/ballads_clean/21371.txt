The Mournful Shepherd : OR The Torment of Loving , and not being Loved again . A SONG made by a Gentleman who Died for his cruel Mistress . No Torment can be found no greater pain Then truly Loving and not Loved again ; For thats a strange Disease which Racks the mind , Still routs the Judgement , and does Reason blind : Raises a Civil War , distracts the Soul , While Fancy like a Raging Sea does roll : The Lovers dreams of nothing but strange Charms . And often thinks his Mistress in his Arms ; But waking finds he did embrace a Shade Which all his hope's with it he had Conveyed . To a Pleasant New Tune , called Could Man his Wish Obtain , etc Played and Sung at the King's Play-House . C Old man his wish obtain , how hapyy would he be ; But wishes seldom gain , And hope's are but in vain , if Fortune's disagree : Pity you Powers of Love , our Infelicity ; Why should the Fates Conspire To frustrate my desire , Since Love's the gentle fine that keeps the World alive : But me it puts to pain , My Wishes are in vain , Nor promise any hope to gain . I love and still I view , but dare not tell my mind , Should I my flames pursue , I might that Bliss undo , which is for her designed , A Bliss that's far above , more lasting , rich and kind : Though hope's successless prove , My heart shall never remove , From wishing of her Love , in Fortune's Triumph led ; And thou she banish me , If she but happy be , it'll please my Ghost when I am dead , Much lke a Tyrant sits the insulting Prince of Love , And with his Arrows hits Poor Mortals as it fits , his humour from above ; But pity I implore , Oh let some pity move : But ah what is my Error , when love thus proves a Terror , That is the worlds-bright Mirror , and guides the Starry frame ; The flame that's in my breast , Alas disturbs my rest , Since I of hope's am dispossessed . Thou Centre of my joy , the fairest of her kind , Does still with frowns destroy , My Bliss by proving Coy , while Love torments my mind : And scorches me in pain , that I no quiet find : Pity some gnetle power And rain a golden Shower , For sure nought else can woo her to cool my raging Flame : Alas , that Gold should prove The Orb that still does move the happy Sphere of sacred love . Over Hills and Rocks I stray through fields and gloomy shade I take my restless way , To Venus oft I pray , to grant me speedy aid , And pity my distress , o how the cruel Maid : Whose eyes do lightning bear , Which blast me with despair , And takes me in Loves snare , nor can I thence escape : But struggle there in vain , And still does suffer pain , Witness you Founts and Springs , Groves , & amp ; each pleasant Mead , Each warbling Bird that sings , And spreads his airy wings ; and bleeting flocks that feeds : How cruel the fair Nymph to me has ever been . But Tyrant love no more , To persecute give over , Keep keep , you shafts in store , of them there is no need : For lick the Swan , now I To sing my last leave try , Which done , I thus lie down & amp ; die . He die . FINIS . Printed for P. Brooksby at the Sign of the Golden Ball in Pye-Corner . The Mournful Shepherd : OR The Torment of Loving , and not being Loved again .
