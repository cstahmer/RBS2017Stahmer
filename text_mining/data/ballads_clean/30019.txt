The Brides Good-morrow . To a pleasant new Tune . THe night is passed & joyful day appears most clear on every side , With pleasant music we therefore salute you , good morrow Mistress Bride : From sleep and slumber no [ w ] awake you out of hand your bridegroom stays at home : Whose fancy , favour , & affection still does stand fixed on thee alone : Dress you in your best array , This must be your wedding day , God almighty send you happy joy : In health and wealth to keep you still , And if it be his blessed will , God keep you safe from sorrow and annoy . This day is honour now brought into thy bosom and comfort to thy hear For God hath sent you a fried for to defend you from sorrow , care and smar In health & sickness for thy comfort day & night he is appointed and brought , Whose love & liking is most constant sure and right , then love you him as you ough Now you have your hearts desire , And the thing you did require , God almighty send you happy joy : In health and wealth to keep e you still , And if it be your blessed will , God keep you safe from sorrow and annoy . There is no treasure the which may be compared unto a faithful friend , Gold soon decayeth and worldly consumeth , and wastes in the wind , But love once planted in a perfect & pure mind endureth weal and woe : The frowns of fortune come they never so unkind cannot thee same overthrow . A bit of bred is better cheer , Where love and friendship does appear , then dainty dishes stuffed full of strife : For where the heart is cloyed with care , Sour is the sweetest fare : and death far better then so bad a life , Sweet Brid then may you full well contended stay you , and in your heart rejoice : Sith God was guider both of your heat & fancy and maker of your choice . And he that preferred you to this happy state will not behold you decay , Nor see you lack relief or help in any rate , if you his precepts obey To those that ask it faithfully , The Lord will no good thing deny , this comfort in the Scriptures may you find , Then let no worldly grief and care , Vex your heart with foul despair , which does declare the unbelieving mind , All things are ready and every whit prepared to bear you company Your friends and parents do give their due attendance together courtously : The house is dressed and garnished for your sake , with flowers gallant and green , A solemn feast your comely cooks do ready make where all your friends will be seen , Young men and maids do ready stand , With sweet Rosemary in their hand , a perfect token of your virgins life : To wait upon you they intend , Unto the Church to make and end : and God make thee a joyful wedded wife .
