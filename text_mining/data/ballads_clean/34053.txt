PACKINGTON'S POUND . I . WHen the Joy of all hearts , and desire of all eyes , In whom our chief Refuge , and Confidence lies , The Protestant Bulwark against all Despair , Has depriv'd us at once , of her Self , and her Heir : That hopeful Young Thing Begotten by a King , And a Queen , whose Perfections o're all the world ring . A Father whose Courage no Mortal can daunt , And a Mother whose Virtue no Scandal can taint . II When Jeffry's resigns up the Purse and the Mace , Whose impudent Arrogance gain'd him the place : When , like Lucifer , thrown from the height of his Pride , And the Knot of his Villany's strangely unty'd . From the Chancery Bawling , He turns a Tarpaulin , Men still catch at anything when they are falling : But to hasten his Fate , before he could scour , Be was tak'n at Wapping , and sent to the Tow'r . III . When Confessor Petre's do's yield up the Game , And proves to the worst of Religion a shame , When his cheating no more o're our Reason prevails , But is blasted like that of his true Prince of Wales : Which was his Contrivance , And our wise K ------ s Connivance , To establish the Papists , and Protestants drive hence : But their Cobweb Conception is brought to the Test , And the coming of ORANGE has quite spoil'd the Jest . IV. When Peterborough Noted for all that's ill , Was urg'd by his Wife to the making his Will ; At the hearing which words , he did stare , foam and roar , Then broke out in Cursing , and calling her Whore . And for Two Hours at least His Tongue never ceas't , He rail'd on Religion , and damn'd the poor Priest , And his Friends , who had hope to behold him expire , Are afraid by this Bout they shall loose their desire . V. Young Salisbury fam'd in this great Expedition , Not for going to War , but obtaining Commission ; It's no Mystery to me , if his Courage did fail , When the Greatest of Monarchs himself did turn Tail : So that if he took Flight , With his Betters by Night , I am apt to believe the pert Spark was i' th' righ For the Papists this Maxim do everywhere hold , To be forward in Boasting , in Courage less Bold . VI . Nor shou'd Bellasis , Powis , and Arundel throng , But each in due place have his Attributes sung . Yet since 'tis believ'd by the strange turn of Times , They'l be call'd to account for their Treasonable Crimes , While the Damn'd Popish Plot Is not yet quite forgotten , For which the Lord Stafford went justly to Pot ; And to their great comfort I'le make it appear , They that gave 'em their Freedom , themselves are not clear . VII . W. Ws. that Friend to the Bishops and Laws , As the Devil wou'd have it , espous'd the wrong Cause ; Now loath'd by the Commons , and scorn'd by the Peers , His Patent for Honour , in pieces he tears . Both our Britains are Fool'd , Who the Laws Over-rul'd , And next Parliament each , will be plagu'ly School'd : Then try if your Cunning can find out a Flaw To preserve you from Judgement according to Law . VII . Sir Edward Hale's Actions I shall not repeat , Till by Axe , or by Halter , his Life he complete ; Pen's History shall be related by Lobb , Who has ventur'd his Neck for a Snack in the Job . All their Priests and Confessors , With their dumb Idol-Dressers , Shall meet that Reward which is due to Transgressors . And no Papist henceforth shall these Kingdoms inherit , But ORANGE shall reap the Reward of his Merit . FINIS . PACKINGTON'S POUND . I .
