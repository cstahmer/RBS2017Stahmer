A Godly Song , entitled , A farewell to the World , made by a Godly Christian , nam Thomas Bill , being the Parish Clerk of West - Felton , as he lay upon his Deathbed , showing the vanity of the World , and his desire to be dissolved . To the Tune of , Fortune my Foe . BEhold Oh Lord a Sinner in distress , Whose heart is vexed with inward heaviness ; Remit my sins my God , and mercy show , For here I live in grief , perplexed with woe , All flesh is frail , and brittle like to glass , men life like fading Flowers away does pass , My time is come that I from hence must go , Then for sweet Jesus sake Lord mercy show . The day and hour is come that I must die , I trust my Soul shall strait ascend the sky , Where Saints and Angels ever do rejoice , Giving him praises due with heart and voice . O sinful Man defer not thou the time , Up Jacobs Ladder Father let me climb , Where as thy Angels up and down descend , Betwixt my Soul and Body at my end . I must not die never to rise again , But I must die for to be freed from pain ; My Saviour by his death hath bought my life , To reign with him when finished is this strife . My earthly Spirits fail , my time is ran , My face is wan , thy Messenger is come , A welcome Guest that welcome is to me , To bear me hence unto felicity . My Sun is set , I have not long to stay , But ere the morning I shall see a day That shall outshine the splendour of the Sun , When to the holy Trinity I come . Me thinks I ( casting up my dying eyes ) Behold the Lord in glory on the skies , With all his heavenly Angels in that place , Smiling with joy to see his cheerful face . Both King and Kesar every one must die , The stoutest heart the sting of death must try , The Rich , the Poor , the Aged , and the Babe , When Fickle comes each flower then does fade . Then World farewell , I see all is but vain , From dust I came , to dust I must again , No humane pomps our life from death can stay , When time is come we must forthwith away . For worldly pleasure is but vanity , None can redeem this life from death I see , Nor Cresus wealth , nor Alexanders fame , Nor Sampsons strength that could death's fury tame Our Father Adam he for since did fallen , Which brought destruction present on us all : But heavenly Father thou thy Son didst send , Us to redeem his dearest blood did spend , Farewell deer Wife and my seven Children small For I must go when as the Lord does call : The Glass is run , my time is passed away , The trump does found , I can no longer stay . Nothing but one I in this world do crave , That is , to bring my Corpses dead to the Grave ; And Angels shall my Soul in safety keep , While that my Body in the grave does sleep . The Bells' most sweetly ringing doe I here , And now stern death with speed apprecheth near ; But the Bell towling doe I hear at last , Sweet Lord receive my Soul when death is past . FINIS . Thomas Bill . The Souls Petition at Heaven Gate ; Or , the Second Part of the Clerk of West-Felton , being Thomas Bill . To the same Tune . O God which framedst both the earth and sky , With speed give ear unto my woeful cry , Receive my Soul with thee for to remain , In Angels bliss , where thou Oh Lord dost reign . Though I against thy Laws rebelled have , For my rebellion Lord I mercy crave , Remit my sins though I have dONE amiss , For Jesus sake take me into true bliss . Where joys are evermore without and end , And heavenly Quiristers the rhyme does spend , In singing Hymns and praises to the Lord , Lifting up heart and voice with one accord . O , what a comfort is it for to s [ e ] e The sacred Face of such a Majesty , As thou Oh God , among thy Angels bright , The which no mortal can behold with sighed . Cast me not Lord out from before that face . But with thy Saints grant me a dwelling place , And from thy Throne , Oh Lord do not expel My Soul , but grant that it with thee may dwell . Let me with David beg to keep a door , In that high Court , where joys are evermore , In Abrahams bosom Father let me fit , Cast not my Soul into the fiery pit . Consume [ m ] e not in thy provoked ire , But mercy grant Oh Lord I thee desire , And though I [ tO ] he offended have by sin , S [ h ] ut not the [ worser ] oore , but let me enter in . I must confess I thee offended have , And am not worthy pardon for to crave , But now with thee all mercy is alone , To whom my Soul for mercy now is flown . Take pity then Oh Lord for Jesus sake , Into thy Tabernacle my Soul take : Remember how thy Son for me hath died , And for my sake deaths passion did abide . He is the Key the gate for to unlock , He makes me entrance when my soul does knock , Unto repentant Souls he promise gave That they with him a place in Heaven should have . Then open unto me Oh Lord thy Gate , Where thou as King dost reign in high estate , Confound me not with them that wicked are , But in thy mercies let me have a share . Deal not in justice with my Soul Oh Lord , For then a heavy sentence thou'lt award ; If sinful Souls should have their due desert , In Hells hight flame they should for ever smar Grant that my Soul may enter in true bliss , Condeme me not though I have dONE amiss , But let my Soul with heavenly Angels sing , Most joyfully to thee my Lord and King . For there are joys which ever shall endure , The waters sweet of Life flow there most pure , There shall no worldly cares our minds molest , But there shall we remain in truest rest . Which blessed inheritance Oh Lord I pray , Give to each Christian in thy righteous way : Grant that we all may gain felicity , In Heaven to dwell above the starry sky . FINIS .
