The Gallant SEAMAN's RESOLUTION : Whose full Intent was , To try his Fortune at SEA , and at his Return marry his Landlady . If Heaven be pleased to bless him with his life , None but his Landlady shall be his Wife : She being a Widow , as it's understood , Of Carriage and Behaviour very good . To the Tune of , Think on thy Loving Landlady , etc A Gallant Youth at Gravesend lived , a Seaman neither rich nor poor ; But when his means was almost spent , he bravely went to Sea for more : Turn to thy Love and take a kiss , this Gold about thy wrist i'll tie ; And always when thou lookest on this , think on thy loving Landlady . His Father being dead and gone , he loved his Mother as his life , And did maintain her gallantly ; it was well known he had no Wife : Turn to thy Love , etc He was beloved of Rich and Poor , and still kept company with the best , A gallant Widow in the Town , her love unto him thus expressed : Turn to thy Love , etc Young Man could I thy favour win , or might thy company but crave , To come and live at home with me , i'll make the Lord of all I have : Turn to thy Love , etc Fair Mistress , I am for the Seas , here's Gold and Silver in my hand , And when the Drums and Trumpets found , I'll bid adieu to fair England : And if thou wilt with patience stay , till I from Sea return again ; For every kiss thou lendest me , I will repay thee ten times ten . Do but resolve to stay at home , I'll put another in thy place . No , that will be a shame , quoth he , and to my name a foul disgrace : Turn to thy Love , etc I have five hundred pound at least , of Silver which I never told , Beside , I have in store for thee , five hundred pound in good read Gold : Turn to thy Love , etc If you could give me all the wealth , that ever Europe did afford : A faithful promise I have made , and I will not be worse than my word : And if thou wilt , etc If neither strength nor policy , can further me in my design , Remain a constant Friend to me , and I for ever will be thine : Turn to thy Love , etc And while that breath and life does last , to me this thing i'll verif [ i ] e ; Though you at Sea , and I on shore , I'll pray for thy prosperity : Turn to thy Love , etc Heaven bless the Ship thou sallest in , whither it swim with wind or tide , And all that with thee comes or goes , I hope that Neptune will them guide : Turn to thy Love , etc From Pirates knocks , and bloody blows , great Mars protect thee still ; Nor may Quicksands or stony Rocks , have power to do thee any ill : Turn to thy Love , etc And while that thou art far away , in Holland , Flanders , France or Spain , As thou in safety didst launch forth , Heaven bring thee safely home again : Turn to thy Love , etc If I may speak without offence , my heart will never quiet be , Till thou give me full recompense , and said that I thy Wife shall be : Turn to thy Love , etc Yet one thing here I beg of thee , before from me thou dost depart , That thou wilt let no one know the thoughts and secrets of thy heart Turn to thy Love , etc When thou art gone out of my sighed , and comsed where pretty Lasses are , Thou wilt fallen in love with some of them , that is the thing I most do fear ; Turn to thy Love , etc If I should hear in any case , that to some other thou shouldst married be , Then would I weep , lament and grieve , and break my heart for love of thee : Turn to thy Love , etc The SEAMAN's REPLY .
