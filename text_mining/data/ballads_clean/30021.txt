A Bill of Fare : For , A Saturday nights Supper , A Sunday morning Breakfast , and A Munday Dinner , Described in a pleasant new merry Ditie . To the tune of Cook Laurel , or , Michaelmas Term . ILe tell you a Jest , which you'l hardly believe : No matter for that , you shall hear't right or wrong , A hungry appetite may perhaps grieve , To hear such a Banquet set forth in a Song , He rather would have it then hear on't hee'l say , But I cannot promise him such a fair sighed ; All that I can do , is with words to display , What we had to Supper on Saturday night . Inprimis , foure Fancies , two boiled , and two roast , A large dish of Endimions ( good for one's drink ) Six Pelican Chickens as hight as a toast , And six Birds of Paradise , brave meat I think , A couple of Phoenix , a Cock and a Hen , That late from Arabia had taken their flight . I think such a Banquet was ne're made for men , As we had to Supper on Saturday night . Two pair of Elephants Pettitoes boiled , A green Dragon Spitchcock ( and excellent dish ) One mess by the Cook was like to be spoil'd , And yet by good hap 'twas to every one's wish : It was a Rhenoceros boiled in Alegant , To all who did taste it , gave great deligh Judge whither we have not occasion to vaunt Of this our rare Supper on Saturday night . A Calves head was roast with a pudding i'th belly , ( Of which all the women did heartily feed ) A dish of Irish Hearts horns boiled to a Jelly , ( Which most men esteem'd as a good dish indeed ) I had almost forgotten to name a sowc'd Owl , Brought up to the Master o'th Feast as his right , He lov'd it he said above all other Foul , And this was our Supper on Saturday night . The next in due course was foure golden Horseshoes , Exactly dissolved through a Woodcocks bill , Six Chameleons in greensauce ( Maids commonly choose ) This dish every day if they may have their will , The chine of a Lion , the haunch of a Bear , Well larded with Brimstone and Quicksilver brigh Judge Gentlemen , was not this excellent cheer , That we had to Supper on Saturday night . A whole Horse soused after the Russian manner , Twelve Pigs of a strange Capadocian Bitch , Six dozen of Ostriches rost , ( which a Tanner Did send out of Asia by and old Witch ) A Leg of and Eagle carbonadoed ( in Snow ) The Pluck of a Grampoise stew'd till it was white , And thus in particular I let you know , What we had to Supper on Saturday night . Then came in and Ell of a Jackanapes tail , Serv'd in upon Sippits as dainty as may be : Oh that is a dainty , which rather then fail , Might well serve to feast and Utopian Lady : Twelve Maids were stew'd in the shell of a Shrimp , And cause it was meat that was held very light , They had for their Sauce a salt pickled Pimp , And this was our Supper on Saturday night . The second part , To the same tune . TWo Bears soused big fashion sent whole to the board , And 4 black swans serv'd by 2 in a dish , With a Lobster fried in steaks : take my word , I know not well whither it was Flesh or Fish , Two Cockatrices , and three Baboons boiled , Two dry Salamanders , a very strange sighed , A Joale of a Whale soundly butter'd and oyl'd , And this was our Supper on Saturday night . A good dish of Modicums , I know not what , In Barbary Vinegar boiled very soft , I mus'd how my Hostis became so huge fat , I find this with eating these Modicums of A Gross of Canary birds roasted alive , That out of the dishes ( for sport ) took their flight , And every one present to catch them did strive : This was our rare Supper on Saturday night . A shoal of Red-herrings with bells 'bout their necks , Which made such rare sport that I never saw such , They leapt and danced with other fine tricks , A man may admire how they could do so much . Two Porposes parboiled in May-dew and Roses , That unto the smell yielded so much delight i Some ( fearing to loose them ) laid hold on their noses , All this was at Supper on Saturday night . Three dozen of Welsh Ambassadors bak't , Which made such a nois it was herd through that town Some hearing the echo their foreheads so ak't , That many a smile was overcome with a frown : A dish of Bonitoes , or Fish that can fly , That out of the Indies came hither by flight , To close by our stomachs , a Gridiron Pye We had to our Supper on Saturday night . But what comes after must not be forgotten , The Fruit and the Cheese as they follow by course , A West-Indian Cheese ( not a bit of it rotten , Thats made of no worse then the milk of a Horse ) A dish of Pineapples , two bushels at least , And hundred of Cokernuts for our delight . The world may admire at this wonderful Feast , Which we had at Supper on Saturday night . Six Pumpians coddled with exquisite Art , To pleasure the palate of every one there . Then we at the last had a great Cabbage Tart ; Thus have I exactly described our Cheer : What all this amounted to , I cannot tell , It cost me just nothing , no faith not a mite , The Master o'th Feast ( whom I know very well ) Did pay for this Supper on Saturday night . we rose from our mirth with the 12-a-clock Chimes , Went every one home as his way did direct ; And I for my part on the morning betimes , Had a Breakfast prepar'd , which I did not expec My wife , because she was not bidden to Supper , ( It seems by the story ) she bore me a spigh The Breakfast she gave me , to you I will utter , It passed our Supper on Saturday night . Sunday morning Breakfast . FIrst had I a dish of Maundering broth , So scalding hight that I could not abide it , But I like a patient man ( though I was loath ) Must swallow all down , cause my wife did provide it , A many small Reasons she put in the same , Her Nose yielded Pepper that keenly did bite : Thought I here's a Breakfast , I thank my good dame , That passes our Supper on Saturday night . A great Carpe Pie , and a dish of sad Poutest , With Crocodile Vinegar , sauce very tart , Quoth she thou last night wast among thy found trouts , Now fallen to thy Breakfast , and comfort thy hear Then had I a Cup full of stout Wormwood Beer , It seems that in Physic she has good insight , This shew'd me the difference 'twixt the homely cheer And our dainty Supper on Saturday night . Munday Dinner . ON this sorry Fare all that day I did feed , And on Munday morning on purpose to win her , I went and god money to furnish her need , And now you shall hear what I had to my Dinner : A Pie made of Conies , with Ducks and Pigs eyes , With a deal of sweet Honey my taste to deligh With sweet Lamb and Chicken my mind to suffice , These passed my Supper on Saturday night . Another Pie made with a many Sheeps eyes , With sweet Sugar Candy that pleased my pallet , These several Banquets my Muse did advice , And with her assistance I made this mad Ballet . There's no man that's wise will my pains reprehend For most married men will confess I say right ; Yet on no occasion this Ditie was pend , But to show our rare Supper on Saturday night . FINIS .

M.P. London , Printed by M.P. for Fr : Grove , near the Sarazens head without Newgate . A Bill of Fare : For , A Saturday nights Supper , A Sunday morning Breakfast , and A Munday Dinner , Described in a pleasant new merry Ditie . To the tune of Cook Laurel , or , Michaelmas Term . ILe tell you a Jest , which you'l hardly believe : No matter for that , you shall hear't right or wrong , A hungry appetite may perhaps grieve , To hear such a Banquet set forth in a Song , He rather would have it then hear on't hee'l say , But I cannot promise him such a fair sighed ; All that I can do , is with words to display , What we had to Supper on Saturday night . Inprimis , foure Fancies , two boiled , and two roast , A large dish of Endimions ( good for one's drink ) Six Pelican Chickens as hight as a toast , And six Birds of Paradise , brave meat I think , A couple of Phoenix , a Cock and a Hen , That late from Arabia had taken their flight . I think such a Banquet was ne're made for men , As we had to Supper on Saturday night . Two pair of Elephants Pettitoes boiled , A green Dragon Spitchcock ( and excellent dish ) One mess by the Cook was like to be spoil'd , And yet by good hap 'twas to every one's wish : It was a Rhenoceros boiled in Alegant , To all who did taste it , gave great deligh Judge whither we have not occasion to vaunt Of this our rare Supper on Saturday night . A Calves head was roast with a pudding i'th belly , ( Of which all the women did heartily feed ) A dish of Irish Hearts horns boiled to a Jelly , ( Which most men esteem'd as a good dish indeed ) I had almost forgotten to name a sowc'd Owl , Brought up to the Master o'th Feast as his right , He lov'd it he said above all other Foul , And this was our Supper on Saturday night . The next in due course was foure golden Horseshoes , Exactly dissolved through a Woodcocks bill , Six Chameleons in greensauce ( Maids commonly choose ) This dish every day if they may have their will , The chine of a Lion , the haunch of a Bear , Well larded with Brimstone and Quicksilver brigh Judge Gentlemen , was not this excellent cheer , That we had to Supper on Saturday night . A whole Horse soused after the Russian manner , Twelve Pigs of a strange Capadocian Bitch , Six dozen of Ostriches rost , ( which a Tanner Did send out of Asia by and old Witch ) A Leg of and Eagle carbonadoed ( in Snow ) The Pluck of a Grampoise stew'd till it was white , And thus in particular I let you know , What we had to Supper on Saturday night . Then came in and Ell of a Jackanapes tail , Serv'd in upon Sippits as dainty as may be : Oh that is a dainty , which rather then fail , Might well serve to feast and Utopian Lady : Twelve Maids were stew'd in the shell of a Shrimp , And cause it was meat that was held very light , They had for their Sauce a salt pickled Pimp , And this was our Supper on Saturday night . The second part , To the same tune . TWo Bears soused big fashion sent whole to the board , And 4 black swans serv'd by 2 in a dish , With a Lobster fried in steaks : take my word , I know not well whither it was Flesh or Fish , Two Cockatrices , and three Baboons boiled , Two dry Salamanders , a very strange sighed , A Joale of a Whale soundly butter'd and oyl'd , And this was our Supper on Saturday night . A good dish of Modicums , I know not what , In Barbary Vinegar boiled very soft , I mus'd how my Hostis became so huge fat , I find this with eating these Modicums of A Gross of Canary birds roasted alive , That out of the dishes ( for sport ) took their flight , And every one present to catch them did strive : This was our rare Supper on Saturday night . A shoal of Red-herrings with bells 'bout their necks , Which made such rare sport that I never saw such , They leapt and danced with other fine tricks , A man may admire how they could do so much . Two Porposes parboiled in May-dew and Roses , That unto the smell yielded so much delight i Some ( fearing to loose them ) laid hold on their noses , All this was at Supper on Saturday night . Three dozen of Welsh Ambassadors bak't , Which made such a nois it was herd through that town Some hearing the echo their foreheads so ak't , That many a smile was overcome with a frown : A dish of Bonitoes , or Fish that can fly , That out of the Indies came hither by flight , To close by our stomachs , a Gridiron Pye We had to our Supper on Saturday night . But what comes after must not be forgotten , The Fruit and the Cheese as they follow by course , A West-Indian Cheese ( not a bit of it rotten , Thats made of no worse then the milk of a Horse ) A dish of Pineapples , two bushels at least , And hundred of Cokernuts for our delight . The world may admire at this wonderful Feast , Which we had at Supper on Saturday night . Six Pumpians coddled with exquisite Art , To pleasure the palate of every one there .
