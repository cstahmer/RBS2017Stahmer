H : 135861 YOUNG JEMMY . And Excellent New Ballad , To and Excellent New Tune . [ 1 ] YOung Jemmy is a Lad That's Royally descended ; With every Virtue clad , By every Tongue commended : A true and faithful English Heart ; Great Brittain's Joy and Hope , And bravely will maintain their Part , In spite of Turk and Pope . [ 2 ] Young Jemmy is a Lad That hates all base Pretences ; No Tory Masquerade , With Popish Sham-Pretences ; A Heart and Soul so Great and Just , Such Conduct and Command ; A Champion in his Countries Trust , Young Jemmy still will stand . [ 3 ] [ Y ] oung Jemmy is a Youth , Who thinks it no Transgression To stand up for the Truth And Protestant Profession ; [ B ] ut Oh! He fights with such Success , All Mortal Powers obey ; No God of War but must confess Young Jemmy bears the sway . [ 4 ] [ A ] tO Jemmy's powerful Voice The Drums and Trumpets sounded ; [ A ] and England did rejoice When Jemmy's Fame abounded . Of Jemmy the victorious Name Did through all Europe fly , [ A ] and all the Nations did proclaim His matchless Gallantry . [ 5 ] [ I ] n Maastricht and in France , In Germany and Flanders , [ Y ] oung Jemmy did advance among the Chief Commanders : [ B ] y Sea and Land his Fame did fly , And all the Nations round Of Jemmy's Constant Victory And Valour did resound . [ 9 ] In Scotland Jemmy's Hand Dispers'd the Whig and Tory ; And Bothwel-Bridge will stand To his Eternal Glory : There he the Rebels Force withstood , And did Their Might oppose , Both for the King and Countries Good , In spite of all his Foes . [ 7 ] But Oh! unhappy Fates ! A Curse on Pride and Malice ; The Popish Plotting-States Have banish'd him the Palace : They turn'd him out of Grace of late , Of Dignity and Fame , And every mighty Place of State , Yet Jemmy's still the same . [ 8 ] Maliciously they Plot ( Against all Sense and Reason ) 'Gainst Shaftsbury and Scot , To Cloak their Popish Treason : Tories and Papists all agree To blast his spotless Fame ; But , 'spight of all their Policy , Young Jemmy's still the same . [ 9 ] For , still to loose his Blood Young Jemmy does importune , And for his Countries' Good To spend his Life and Fortune , For to support the Church and State , Our Liberties and Laws , Against their Malice , Plots and Hate That wou'd our Rights oppose . [ 10 ] Let all good men implore For Jemmy's Restauration , Whose Conduct must restore The Ruins of our Nation ; That he to Charles's Praise may live Our Freedom to maintain , When Jemmy shall his Fame retrieve , And be in Grace again .
