' [ A m ] ost excellent Ballad of S. George for England and the Kings daugh - [ ter ] [ of ] AEgipt , whom he delivered from death , and how he slew a mighty Dragon . The tune is flying fame .

[ St. Georges Deeds and English K ] night , [ Against the Saracens full rud ] e , [ fought he full long and m ] any a day , [ Where many a Giant he s ] ubdu'd [ in honour of the Christi ] and way . [ And after many advent ] ures past [ To AEgipt Land he cam ] e at last . [ And as the story ] p [ lain ] does tell , [ within that Counterfeit ] untry there did rest . [ A dreadfu ] l Dragon fierce and fell [ whereb ] y they were full soar oppressed . [ Who by ] his poisoned breath each day [ WORSER ] id many of that City slay . [ TO ] he grief whereof did grow so gr [ e ] at [ th ] roughout the limets of the land . [ That ] the [ y their ] wise men did entreat [ to show their cunn ] ing out of hand . [ Which way the ] y might this Dragon stroy [ That did their ] Country so annoy . [ The wiseme ] n all before the King , [ framed thy ] s matter incontinent , [ The Dragon ] none to death might bring , [ by and mea ] ns they would invent [ His skin m ] over hard then brass was found [ That ] sword [ or ] spear can pierce or w [ oh ] u [ n ] worser , [ Wh ] en this thee [ p ] eop [ l ] e understood , [ they cried ] out most piteously , [ The Dragons ] breath infected their blood , [ that they each way in ] heaps each day did die . [ among tO ] hem such a plague i [ tO ] bred , [ The living ] scarce could bury the dead . [ No means there ] was as they could find [ for ] to [ ap ] peas this Dragons rage . [ But by ] a Virgin pure and kind [ when ] reby they might his fury suage . [ Each worser ] ay he should a Maiden eat , [ for to a ] llay his hunger great . This thing by art the wise men found which truly must observed be , Wherrefore throughout the City round a Virgin pure of good degree . Was by the Kings commission still , Took up to serve the Dragons will . Thus did the Dragon every day , a Maiden of the town devour . Till all the Maids were worn away and none were left that present hour . Saving the Kings fair daughter bright , Her father's joy and hearts delight . Then came the Officers to the King this heavy message to declare , Which did his heart with sorrow sting , she is quoth he my Kingdoms heir . O let us all be poisoned here , Ere she should die that is my dear . Then rose the people presently and to the King in rage they went , Who said his daughter dear should die the Dragons fury to prevent , Our daughters all are dead quoth they And have been made the Dragons prey . And by their blood we have been blessed and thou hast sav'd thy li [ f ] e thereby . And now in justice it does rest , for us thy daughter so should die Oh save my daughter said the King And let me feel the Dragons sting , Then fell fair Sabrine on her knee and to her father then did say , Oh father strive not thus for me , but let me be the Dragons prey , It may be for my sake alone , This plague upon this land was shown . This better I should die she said , then all your Subject's perish quite , Perhaps the Dragon here was laid , for my offence to work this spite . And after he hath sucked my gore , Your land shall feel the grief no more What hast thou done my daughter dear for to deserve this heavy scourge , It is my fault as may appear , which makes thee Gods our state to grudge Then ought I die to stint the strife , And to preserve thy happy life . Like mad men that [ e ] n the people cry'd thy death to us can do no good Our safety only does abide , to make thy daughter Dragons food . Lo here am I I come quoth she , Therefore do what you will with me . Nay stay dear daughter quoth the Queen and as thou art a Virgin bright , That hast for Virtue famous been , so let me cloth thee all in white . And crown thy head with flowers sweet , And Ornament for Virgins meet . And when she was attired so , according to her mother's mind , Unto the stake then did she go , to which they did this Virgin bind Who being bound to stake and thrall , She had farewell unto them all . Farewell dear father then quoth she , and my sweet mother meek and mild , Take you no thought nor weep for me , for you may have another changed [ i ] ld . Here for my Countries good I'll die , Which I receive [ e ] most willingly . The King and Queen withal their train with weeping eyes went then their way , And let their daughter there remain to be the hungry Dragons prey , But as she did there weeping lie , Behold St. George came riding by . And seeing there a Lady bright , fast tied to the stake that day . Most like unto a valiant knight , straight unto her did take his way , Tell me sweet Maiden then quoth he . What person thus abused thee . And lo by Christ his cross I vow , which here is figured on my breast , I will revenge it on his brow , and break my lance upon his crest . And speaking thus whereas he stood , The Dragon issued out of the wood The Lady that did first espy the Dreadful Dragon coming so Unto St. George aloud did cry . and willed him away to go . Here comes that cursed fiend quoth she That soon will make and end of me St. George then looking round about the fiery Dragon soon espy'd , And like a knight of cou [ ra ] ge stout , against h [ i ] m he did fiercely ride . And with such blows he did him greet , That he fell und [ e ] r his horse feet . FOr with a Lance that was so strong as he came gaping in his face , In at his mouth he thrust it long the which could pierce no other place . And there within this Ladies view This Dreadful Dragon then he slew . The savour of his poisoned breath could do this Christian knig [ h ] tO no harm Thus did he save the Lady from death . and home he led her by the arm . Which when Ptolomy did see , There was great mirth and melody . When as the famous knight St. George , had slave the Dragon in the field , And brought the Lady to the Court whose sighed with joy their hearts fil'd He in the Egyptian Court then stayed Till he most falsely was betrayed . The Lady Sabrine lov'd him well he counted her his only joy . But when their lov [ e ] was open known it prov'd to Georges great annoy . The Morocco King was in the Court , Who to the Orchard did resort , Daily to take the pleasant Air , for pleasures sake he us [ ' ] worser to walk Under a wall whereas he herd St. George with Lady Sabrine talk . Their love he revealed to the King , Which to St. George great woe did bring . These kings together did devise , to make this Christian knight away , With letters him Ambassador they straightway sent to Persia , And wrou [ g ] ht to Sophy him to kill , And trai [ tO ] erously his blood to spill . Thus they for good did him reward with evil and most subtly , By much vile means they did devise to work his death most cruelly . While he in Persia abided , He quite destroyed each Idol God . Which being done he straight was cast into a Dungeon dark and deep But when he thought upon his wrong , he bitterly did wail and weep . Yet like a knight of courage stout , Forth of the Dungeon he god out . And in the night three ho [ r ] se-keepers this valiant knight by power slew , Although he fasted many a day , and then away from thence he flew . On the best steed the Sophy had , Which when he knew he was full sad . Then into Christ [ e ] ndome he came and met a Giant by the way , With whom in combat he did fight , most valiantly a Summer's day , Who yet for all his bates of steel , Was forc'd the sting of death to feel . From Changed [ ri ] stendo [ me ] this valiant knight then with warlike So [ ? ] ivi [ ? ] rs past , Vowing upon those heathen Lands to woe [ r ] k re [ v ] enge which at the l [ a ] st E'r thrice three years was gone and spent He old unto his great content .

And crown thy head with flowers sweet , And Ornament for Virgins meet . And when she was attired so , according to her mother's mind , Unto the stake then did she go , to which they did this Virgin bind Who being bound to stake and thrall , She had farewell unto them all . Farewell dear father then quoth she , and my sweet mother meek and mild , Take you no thought nor weep for me , for you may have another changed [ i ] ld . Here for my Countries good I'll die , Which I receive [ e ] most willingly . The King and Queen withal their train with weeping eyes went then their way , And let their daughter there remain to be the hungry Dragons prey , But as she did there weeping lie , Behold St. George came riding by . And seeing there a Lady bright , fast tied to the stake that day . Most like unto a valiant knight , straight unto her did take his way , Tell me sweet Maiden then quoth he . What person thus abused thee . And lo by Christ his cross I vow , which here is figured on my breast , I will revenge it on his brow , and break my lance upon his crest . And speaking thus whereas he stood , The Dragon issued out of the wood The Lady that did first espy the Dreadful Dragon coming so Unto St. George aloud did cry . and willed him away to go . Here comes that cursed fiend quoth she That soon will make and end of me St. George then looking round about the fiery Dragon soon espy'd , And like a knight of cou [ ra ] ge stout , against h [ i ] m he did fiercely ride . And with such blows he did him greet , That he fell und [ e ] r his horse feet . FOr with a Lance that was so strong as he came gaping in his face , In at his mouth he thrust it long the which could pierce no other place . And there within this Ladies view This Dreadful Dragon then he slew . The savour of his poisoned breath could do this Christian knig [ h ] tO no harm Thus did he save the Lady from death . and home he led her by the arm . Which when Ptolomy did see , There was great mirth and melody . When as the famous knight St. George , had slave the Dragon in the field , And brought the Lady to the Court whose sighed with joy their hearts fil'd He in the Egyptian Court then stayed Till he most falsely was betrayed . The Lady Sabrine lov'd him well he counted her his only joy . But when their lov [ e ] was open known it prov'd to Georges great annoy . The Morocco King was in the Court , Who to the Orchard did resort , Daily to take the pleasant Air , for pleasures sake he us [ ' ] worser to walk Under a wall whereas he herd St. George with Lady Sabrine talk . Their love he revealed to the King , Which to St. George great woe did bring . These kings together did devise , to make this Christian knight away , With letters him Ambassador they straightway sent to Persia , And wrou [ g ] ht to Sophy him to kill , And trai [ tO ] erously his blood to spill . Thus they for good did him reward with evil and most subtly , By much vile means they did devise to work his death most cruelly . While he in Persia abided , He quite destroyed each Idol God . Which being done he straight was cast into a Dungeon dark and deep But when he thought upon his wrong , he bitterly did wail and weep . Yet like a knight of courage stout , Forth of the Dungeon he god out . And in the night three ho [ r ] se-keepers this valiant knight by power slew , Although he fasted many a day , and then away from thence he flew . On the best steed the Sophy had , Which when he knew he was full sad . Then into Christ [ e ] ndome he came and met a Giant by the way , With whom in combat he did fight , most valiantly a Summer's day , Who yet for all his bates of steel , Was forc'd the sting of death to feel . From Changed [ ri ] stendo [ me ] this valiant knight then with warlike So [ ? ] ivi [ ? ] rs past , Vowing upon those heathen Lands to woe [ r ] k re [ v ] enge which at the l [ a ] st E'r thrice three years was gone and spent He old unto his great content . Save only AEgipt land he spar'd . for S [ a ] brine bright her only sake And ere his rage he did suppress , he meant a trial kind to make , P [ tO ] olomy did know his strength in field , And unto him did kindly yield . Then he the Morocco King did kill and took fair Sabrine to his wife , And after that contentedly with her St. George did led his life . Who by the Virtue of her chain : Did still a Virgin pure remain . To England then St. George did bring , this gallant Lady Sabrine bright , And Enuch also came with him in whom the Lady did delight . None but those three from AEgipt came , Now let me print St. Georges fame . When they were in the Forest great the Lady did desire to rest , And then St. George to kill a Deer . to feed thereon did think it best , Left Sabrine and the Enuch there , While he did go and kill a Deer . The mean time in his absence came , two hungry Lyons fierce and fell , And tore the Enuch presently in pieces small the truth to tell . Down by the Lady then they laid , Where by it seems she was a M [ a ] id . But when St. Georg [ e ] from hunting came , and did behold this heavy chance . Yet for his lovely Virgin pure . his courage then he did advance . And came into the Lyons sighed . Who ran at him withal their might . But he being no whit dismayed , but like a stout and valiant knight , Did kill the hungry Lyons both within the Lady Sabrines sighed , But all this while sad and demure . She stood there like a Virgin pure , Then when St. George did truly know this Lady was a Virgin pure , His doleful thoughts that ere was dumb began most firmly to renew , He set her on a paltry steed , And towards England came with speed Where he arrived in short while , unto his Father's dw [ e ] lling place , Where with his dear [ e ] st love he liv'd , when fortune did their Nuptials grace , They many years of joy did see , And led their lives at Coventry , printed for F.
