Do you not see the Stars retreat when Sol salutes the sky so clear So must all beau [ tO ] i [ e ] s ne [ 'r ] e so g [ r ] eat shrink and withdraw when she appear ; So br [ i ] ght so clea [ r ] , that all must say ' [ tO ] is fair Roselia claims the day , She's virtuous , chaste , and if there , etc Her bashful Cheeks with blushing sweet , cast such a rich ve [ r ] mill [ i ] on die , That Rose and Lily tO [ h ] ere does meet each striving for the victory : So rare , so pu [ r ] e , you'l scarce beli [ e ] we dame Nature could such colours [ g ] ive She's virtuous , chaste , and if there etc Her eyes like sparks of Diamond [ s ] cl [ e ] are such glances cast in merry sort No wantonness in them appears yet Cupid sure [ tO ] here keeps his court 'Twas from her Eyes he shot his dart that thus hath pierc' [ worser ] my l [ oh ] ve-si [ c ] k heart She's virtuous , chaste , and if there , etc But stay my Muse what need have I to praise her beauty to such sort , When as her fame abroad does fly more then I can of her [ r ] epor [ tO ] : We [ r ] e she to me as kind as fair then might I live and not despair But sure I think if that there be a Phoenix in the World 'tis she For she desires to be alone and never to participate , Her love she says to any one but single livs without a mate , Such thoughts I think in few remain yet does in her the more [ r ] es my pain Then sure I think if that there be , etc Cruel she is to none I hear no more she is not u [ n ] to me Nor proved she is not that is rare you'l say in women for to be She's courteous , lovely , chaste , and fair , 'tis few that can with her compare For sure I think if that there be , etc Then if she Phenix-like will live and die alone I am content My heart to her isle freely give unto no other isle consent But in her flames my heart shall burn and Phoenix like to ashes turn , For it is her and none but she by whom I must revived be . And if she will not yield at last but still her resolution hold , I will not think my time ill spent nor yet my love shall ne're wax cold To st [ a ] y for such a one as she , I think no time there lost will be , I'd better with my fancy wed then lodge some women in my bed . I that you needs would know of me whereas this Phoenix does abide For that I must excused be yet near the Strand she does reside No other notice will I give to any one while I do live , And if she does a Phoenix die look in her ashes there am I . You roving Bachelors that be resolved for to spend your time , In several Maidens company when as their beauty are in prime , Beware , beware , let virtue guide that [ ee ] to a Maid to make thy Bride : Let not her beauty tempt your eye , least virtue too in her you spy . I must depart time calls away I cannot now express my mind , This Song is long enough you'l say unless that she did prove more kin [ worser ] She's virtuous , chaste , and therefore resolve to love her till I die .
