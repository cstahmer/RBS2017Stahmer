A New Ballad ; declaring the Excellent Parable of the Prodigal Child . To the Tune of , The wanton Wife . THere was a grave man , both wealthy and wise Two Sons had both proper and tall . The elder was very proper and very precise , The other to wildness did wholly incline , his Parents therefore , was grieved full soar , And mighty displeasure against him they boar , young men remember delights are but vain , and after sweet pleasure comes sorrow & pain . This lusty brave youngster that lived at ease , And never had tasted the temper of care , Quoth he , if my doings your mind do displease , Then give me my portion that falls to my share , then you shall not be , long troubled with me , Yet will I live gallant and pleasant , quoth he , young men , etc O , quoth his Parents , you wicked lewd Lad , What will become of thee where thou shalt go ; Seeing thy government it is so bad , But misery and beggary upon thee shall grow , quoth he if I knew , that this would be true , Be sure I would never make moan unto you , young men , etc His Parents that saw him put him to flight , Paid him his portion without all delay : Saying , good Sir , I pray take your flight , I mean not quoth he , in your presence to stay , but now I will see each foreign Country , And view the world what fashions there be , young men , etc Thus in his jollity he rides along , And in his apparel most sumptuous and brave , To view this brave gallant much people did throng , Where he like a Prince himself did behave , yea honoured was he , with cap and with knee , And at his command the proudest now be , young men , etc With music each morning his ears they had fed , Of gold and silver he makes no spare , With flattering speeches away he was led , His body is fed with delicate fare : what he does require , he hath at his desire , But such as want money may lie in the mire , young men , etc Proper fine women of beauty most bright , Do strive for his favour and friendship each day , They call him their honey , their joy and delight , They kiss him , they cull him and wantonly play , they swear till they die , though falsely they lie , He shall be their sweetheart and pretty pigs-nigh , young men , etc Some gave him handkerchiefs , some gave him rings Some strewed his windows with flowers so sweet , Some to delight him both dances and sings , Some with Rosewater does wash his feet , and what shall I say , they took him away , They woo him & do him what kindness they may , young men , etc Thus with their allurements , their winks , and their wiles They used to bewitch this prodigal boy : He buys with gold angels their kisses and smiles , And stores them with every new fangle and toy , he buys them new Gowns , and many fair pounds , In white-wine & sugar among them he drowns , young men , etc When he had upon them thus wasted his wealth , Consumed his substance , his treasure and store , Yea , cracked all his credit with hazard of health , That he could banquet these Minions no more , with words of despite , they fly from his sighed , They call him base Rascal , forsaking him quite , young men remember delights are but vain , and after sweet pleasure comes sorrow & pain . The second Part , showing the great misery he endured , being constrained through hunger , to eat with the Hogs , and how his merciful Father received him again . To the same Tune . THen was he brought to misery great , His garments all ragged and torn you might see His body near starved for want of good meat His clothes out at elbows , his hose broke at knee : and in his distress , he knew no redress , His harlots spit at him in his heaviness , Young men remember delights are but vain , And after sweet pleasure comes sorrow and pain . Then bitterly mourning he went up and down , To get him a Master that he might dine : At length a rich Citizen dwelling in town , Sends him to the Country to keep all his swine , whose hunger was great , for want of good meat , He sat him down by the Hogs , husks for to ea Youngmen , etc And as by the Hogs he was feeding a pace , With many a sighs and sob he did say , Now I am brought to a pitiful case . Alack that my Parents I did disobey , their servants at home , the very worst Groom , Have meat and drink plenty and here I have none , Young men , etc Wherefore to my father again I will go , Asking him forgiveness for my lewd life , Showing to him my grief and my woe . Reputing my folly that it set at strife : then straight the same day , he takes his way , And came to his father's in raged array , Young men , etc With bitter mourning he falls on his knee , Saying , dear father forgive what is done , For I have offended Christ Jesus and thee , Unworthy I am to be called thy son : yet do not disdain , to take me again , As one of thy servants to take any pain ; Young men , etc With that the tears fell from his father's eyes , With joy and gladness they flew full fast , He kissed his son , and bid him arise , Saying I have found my child that was lost , with garments full gay , he did him array , And killed a fat calf to honour that day , young men , etc And gently led him by the hand , Great joy and melody there was made ; But when his eldest brother did understand The truth of every thing that hath been said , full angry was he , when this he did see , His prodigal brother thus honoured would be , young men , etc And to his father thus he did speak , Long have I served thee and many a day , And thy commandments never did break , But all my Life long I did thee obey ; yet never found I , such great courtesy As this wretched unthrift that let his wealth fly , young men , etc O , quoth his Father , consider my Son , All that I have one day shall be thine , Then do not grudge at what I have done , Nor at thy poor brother do thou repine ; for he was lost plain , but is found again , He was dead , but now is risen again , young men , etc This worthy Parable Christ he did tell , Unto the comforters of Christians each one , Although by our wickedness we do rebel , Yet by true repentance our Father of Heaven does pity our case receiving us to grace , In joys everlasting with him to take pain , young men remember delights are but vain , and after sweet pleasures come sorrow & pain .
