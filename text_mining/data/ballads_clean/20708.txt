A new Ballad ; Declaring the Excellent Parable of the Prodigal Child . To the Tune of , The Wanton Wife . TO Here was a grave man , both wealthy & amp ; wise , Two Sons had both proper and tall , The elder was very proper and very precise , The other to wildness did whole incline , his Parents therefore was grieved full soar , And mighty displeasure against him they boar , Youngmen remember delights are but vain , And after sweet pleasure comes sorrow and pain . This lusty brave youngster that lived at ease , And never had tasted the temper of care , Quoth he , if my doings your mind do displease , Then give me my portion that falls to my share , then you shall not be long troubled with me , Yet will I live gallant and pleasant quoth he , Young men , etc O , quoth his Parents , you wicked lewd Lad , What will become of thee where thou shalt go ? Seeing thy government it is so bad , But misery and beggary upon thee shall grow ; quoth he if I knew that this would be true , Be sure I would never make moan unto you , Young men , etc His Parents that saw him put him to flight , Paid him his Portion without all delay : Saying , good Sire , I pray take your flight , I mean not ( quoth he ) in your presence to stay , but now I will see , each foreign Country , And view the world what fashions there be , Young men , etc Thus in his Jollity he rides along , And in his apparel most sumptuous and brave , To view this brave gallant much people did throng Where he like to a Prince himself did behave , yea honoured was he , with cap and with knee , And at his command the proudest now be , Young men , etc With music each morning his ears they had fed , Of gold and silver he makes no spare , With flattering speeches away he was led , His body is fed with delicate fare : what he does require he hath at his desire , But such as want money may lie in the mire , Young men , etc Proper fine women of beauty most bright , Do strive for his favour and friendship each day , They call him their honey , their joy and delight They kiss him , they cull him , and wantonly play they swear till they die though falsely they lie , He shall be their sweetheart and pretty pigs-nigh , Young men , etc some gave him handkerchiefs , some gave him rings Some strewed his windows with flowers most sweet Some to delight him both dances and sings Some with Rosewater does wash his feet , and what shall I say they took him away , They woo him & amp ; do him what kindness they may Young men , etc Thus with their allurements , their winks , & amp ; their wiles They used to bewitch this prodigal boy : He buys with gold angels their kisses and smiles And stores them with every new fangle and toy he buys them new gowns and many fair pounds , In white-wine & amp ; sugar among them he drowns Young men , etc When he had upon them thus wasted his wealth Consumed his substance his treasure and store Yea , cracked all his credit with hazard of health , That he could banquet these Minions no more : with works of despite they fly from his fight , They call him base Rascal , forsaking him quite : Young men remember delights are but vain , And after sweet pleasure comes sorrows & amp ; pain . The Second Part , showing the great Misery he endured , being constrained through Hunger to eat with the Hogs , and how his Merciful Father received him again . To the same Tune . Then was he brought to misery great , His garments all ragged & amp ; torn you might see His body near starved for want of good meat , His arms out at elbows , his hose broke at knee , and is his distress he knew no redress , His Harlots spit at him in his heaviness , Young men remember delights are but vain , And after sweet pleasures comes sorrow and pain . Then bitterly mourning he went up and down To get him a Master that he might dine : At length a rich Citizen dwelling in town , Sends him to the Country to keep all his Swine , whose hunger was great , for want of good meat , He sat him down by the Hogs husks for to eat , Young men , etc And as by the Hogs he was feeding a pace With many a sighs and sob he did say , Now I am brought to a pitiful case , Alack that my Parents I did disobey : their servants at home , the very worst groom , Have meat and drink plenty and hear I have none Young men , etc Wherefore to my Father again I will go , Asking him forgiveness for my lewd life , Showing to him my grief and my woe , Reputing my folly that it set at strife then striaght the same day he takes his way , And came to his father's in ragged array , Young men , etc With bitter mourning he falls on his knee Saying dear father forgive what is done ; For I have offended Christ Jesus and thee , Unworthy I am to be called thy son ? yet do not disdain to take me again , As one of thy servants to take any pain ; Young men , etc With that the tears fell from his father's eyes . With joy and gladness they flew full fast , He kissed his son , and bid him arise , Saying I have found my child that was lost with garments full gay , he did him array , And killed a fat calf to honour that day , Young men , etc And gently led him by the hand , Great joy and melody there was made : But when his eldest brother did understand The truth of every thing that hath been said , full angry was he when this he did see , His prodigal brother thus honoured would be , Young men , etc And to his father thus he did speak , Long have I served thee and many a day , And thy commandments never did break , But all my life long I did thee obey : yet never found I such great courtesy As this wretched unthrift , that let his wealth fly Young men , etc O ( quoth his Father ) consider my Son , All that I have one day shall be thine , Then do not grudge at what I have done , Nor at thy poor brother do thou repine : for he was lost plain , but is found again , He was dead , but now is risen again . Young men , etc This worthy Parable Christ he did tell , Unto the comforters of Christians each one , Although by our wickedness we do rebel , Yet by true repentance our Father of Heaven , do pity our case , receiving us to grace , In joys everlasting with him to take pain , Young men remember delights are but vain , And after sweet pleasures comes sorrow and pain .
