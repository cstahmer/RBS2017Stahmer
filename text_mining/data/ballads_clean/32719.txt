In this Table is set forth three principal things : First , men Creation : see - condly , his Misery in Adams Fallen : and lastly , the happy restoring a - gain of all the faithful by CHRIST to the un - changeable love of God . A Table fit for all Christians to know . 1. ALmightie GOD made by his Word All Creatures that the earth afford : The Dark , & Light was then divided , And thus by GOD it was decided , The Light by him was called Day , The Darkness Night , and so they stay . John 1.1,2,3 . Genes . 1.4,5 . 2. And GOD saw all , and it was good , From Man to Beast , and fruitful Bud : But Envy then did Eve beguile , And Eve brought Adam to exile , By eating that which was foretold , That they with it should not be bold . Genes . 1.31 . Genes . 1.12 . 25. 27. Genes . 3.13 . 23. 24. Genes . 2.17 . 3. Soon after this did GOD appear Then Eve and Adam did him fear : And as he walk'd in cool of day , Those sinners hid themselves away : But GOD did call them here below , To tell him how they came to know . Genes . 3.8.10 . Genes . 3.9.11 . 4. Thus then begins the Man to say , She whom thou gav'st did I obey : And Eve likewise excus'de the fact , Imputing it the Serpents act . And thus do most in Adams line , Shame not to say , The fault's not mine . Genes . 3.12,13 . 5. But let all those think thus withal That God is free from Adams fallen , Else how could he in truth proceed Against our Parents , as we read : He hates injustice here below , And this his righteousness does show . Psal. 145.17 . Genes . 1.31 . Genes . 2.16,17 . Ezek. 33.11 . Deut. 32.4 . and 25,13,14 , 15,16 . 6. Now when our Parents tale was done , Then justly GOD proceeds upon : The Serpent first he cursed in place , And made Eve subject with disgrace : And man in sorrow labour must All days of life then turn to dust . Genes . 3,14 , 16 , 17 , 19. 7. And Death likewise the time shall rue , For Christ alone shall it subdue : This truth is known to Satans woe , Since Christ hath broke his head also : For GOD did promise make to send A godly Seed , all strife to end . 1 Cor. 15. 26. Genes . 3.15 . 8. This Seed is Christ , free from all sin , What Adam lost , that He did win , By keeping that without all blame , Which never man could do the same : And in our stead he paid our debt , To let us free from Satans net . John 8.46 . 1 Cor. 15.21,22 . Isa. 53.5,6 . 1 John 3.8 . 9. GOD will not now , nor e'er hereafter Condemn us for our sins by nature : For how can that with Justice stand , When GOD shall twice one debt demand . Therefore it now remains with us , That we believe Christ hath done thus . Rom. 8.1 . John 5.24 . John 8.24 . John 3.36 . 10. And thus believing faithfully , Christs righteousness we must apply . For when we have done all we may , On his obedience must we stay : And those whose Faith is found and true , Do practise still Gods laws to do . Galat. 2.20 . John 26. Luke 17.10 . John 14.15.21 . 1 John 2.3,4 , 5,6 . 11. Of such as these does God with speed , Accept their will as for their deed , And though they sin , for so do all , Yet finally they shall not fallen : For by belief in Christ above , None can remove these from his love . 2 Cor. 8.12 . James 3.2 . 1 Pet. 1.3,4,5 . John 10.28,29 . Rom. 8.38,39 . 12. O love us then of thy free grace , Whereby in heaven we may have place , To praise thee still for thy free love , And love thy praise fore'er above . And now good Lord we crave no more , But love us for thy love therefore . John 15.13 . John 17.24 . Revel . 19.1,3 , 4,5,6,7 . FINIS . J.D. Printed at London for Thomas Ellis at the sign of the Christopher in Pauls Churchyard . 1629.
