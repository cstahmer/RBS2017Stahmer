H : 18331 Fear God And Honour the King . A Psalm of Prayer and praise for the prosperous and good estate of our Sovereign Lord the King , his royal progeny , and the whole estate of his Majesties dominions and people ; drawn from the Foum - taine of Faith , for the private use of the poor Orphans in Christs Hospi - tall ; or any true Christian , wishing wealth and peace to Sion . LORD give thy Judgements to our King , therein instruct him well : And with his Son that Princely thing , Lord let thy graces dwell . That they may govern righteously , and rule thy folk arigh And so defend with equity , the weak , which have no might . The simple heart , the Widows poor , and Orphans in distress , To save from wrong , and evil doer to punish and repress . Esa. 32.1 . Psal. 72.1 . Psal. 82.2 . psal . 101. Psal. 12.5 . Direct his Nobles readily , to guide their folk in peace : And let the Magistrates apply , in justice to increase . That they also may help the weak , and those with wrong oppress From such as hurt and proudly speak , to give them peace and rest , That all may know , and eke obey ; regard and fear thy migh So long as Sun doth shine by day , or else the Moon by night . Esa. 32.2 . Pal. 72.4 . Plal 10.12 . Psal. 12.4 . Plal . 72.12 . Lord make our King unto the just , like rain on fields new mowen And as the drops that say the dust , and fresh the land late sown , That they may prosper in his time , In grace , in wealth and peace : Although the wicked do repine , yet let them not increase . That these ends of the earth ( the West ) possessions of thy son , May in thy right , rule and be blessed , till date of time be done . Pro. 16.15 . Psal. 72.6 . Psal. 85.9 . Psal. 10.1 . Psal. 10.15 . Pro. 20.26 . Psal. 2. Plant unity within his Realms , with wealth and grace divine : Let knowledge flow like crystal streams , and Babels sect decline . Direct him and his royal raze , thy Syon still to rear : In length of days with health and peace , in thy true faith and fear . That sacrifices of prayer , and praise , with alms may offered be : In faith and love , to thee always , by all in each degree . Psa. 144.15 Esa. 66.12 . Re . 18.2 . Heb. 13.15 . 16. Psal. 89.15 Jeam . 1.27 . With grace & love , with wealth and peace , this noble City bless , And all that do our good increase ; we pray thee Lord no less . Accept our prayers , receive our praise , which now to thee we give , For these , and all thy gifts always ; and will do while we live . All glory to the Trinitie , both now and eke for aye , To God all one , in persons three , one essence pure we pray . FINIS . Imprinted at London by Edward Allde .
