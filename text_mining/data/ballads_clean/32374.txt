H : 143196 THE HUE-and-SONG AFTER PATIENCE . Have but a little PATIENCE , and you shall hear , How PATIENCE had the Gift to Lie and Swear ; How PATIENCE cou'd with PATIENCE stand a Lie ; ( But PATIENCE wants to stand the PILLORY . ) Out of all PATIENCE , to the Hague He steers : To stay He had not PATIENCE , for his EARS . To the Tune of , Hail to the Myrtle Sbades . I . HAil to London fair Town All hail to the Mayor & the Shrievs ; Hail to the Scarlet Gown , Whose Sentence our Patience grieves : Justice and Law have prevail'd , With PATIENCE a Verdict to find , 'Gainst Patience , whose conscience fail'd ; O Patience ! why art so blind ? II PATIENCE , the joy of the Town , The comfort and hope of the Crowd ; PATIENCE , who god Renown , By Perjury , Lies and Fraud : PATIENCE who ne'r had the Heart His Sovereign's Rights to maintain ; But Patience he had the Art To Swear and Forswear again . III . PATIENCE for Church and for State , And Patience for Meetings by stealth ; PATIENCE , who wou'd translate The State to a Commonwealth : Whose Zeal has his Patience betray'd , To lie for the Saints in distress ; Nay , tho' he's Forsworn , ( 'tis said , ) He Swore he could do no less . IV. PATIENCE , whose Zeal did contrive The Monument Figures and Spire , That while there's a Papist alive We may not forget the Fire : The Pillory now is his Lot , He has rais'd such a flame with his Crew , That London is now too hight ; O Patience ! where art thou now ? V. PATIENCE for Zeal to the Cause , Did preach to the Captives in Goal ; Patience , with great applause , Gave large to and Hospital : To USE now his Money may lend , For Pomfret he'l never more stand , Nor Warrants for Tories send , T'please Titus o'th' Perjur'd Band . VI . PATIENCE with Collar of Brass , To woeful Disasters did fallen ; Patience with Copper Face , And a Conscience worse than all ; To Holland , to Holland he goes ; For plainly now it appears , ( That in spite of all Whiggish Laws , ) Ignoramus can't save his Ears . VII . Some say that the Saints may not Swear , But Lie ev'n as much as they can ; Yet Patience in spite on's Ears , Will Swear and Forswear again : That Patience should be so far lost , Alas ! who with Patience can hear ? That a Saint should be Knight o'th' Post , And and Elder without and Ear . VIII . Let ev'ry good Subject with Me , Who Patience a Virtue does praise , Lest he fallen into Perjury , With Patience pray for Grace . But now I with Patience have done , Left with Patience I keep such a Rout , That astray more with Patience run , And weary your Patience out . Printed in the Year of the Saints Tribulation , 1683.
