And stately Cales can witness well , even by his Proclamation right : He did command them all straitly , to have a care of Infants lives : That none should ravish maid nor wife which was against their order right . Therefore they prayed for his long life which lately took his last goodnight .

Shrove tusday in the night , welladay , welladay , With a heavy hearted sprite , as it is said : The Lieutenant of the Tower , who kept him in his power , At ten a clock that hour , to him did come . And said unto him there mournfully , mournfully , My Lord you must prepare , to die to morrow . Gods will be done quoth he , yet shall you strangely see God strong in me to be , though I am weak . I pray you pray for me , welladay , welladay : That God may strengthen me , against that hour : Then straight way he did call to the Guard under the wall , And did entreat them all for him to pray . For to morrow is the day , welladay , welladay , That I the debt must pay , which I do owe : It [ is ] my life I mean : [ Which I must pay the Queen ] Even so hath Justice given , that I must die . In the morning was he brought welladay , welladay , Where a Scaffold was set up within the Tower : Many Lords were present then with other Gentlemen , Which were appointed then to see him die . You Noble Lords , quoth he , welladay , welladay , That must the witness be , of this my death : Know I never lov'd Papistry , but still did it defy , And Essex thus did die , here in this place . I have a sinner been , welladay , welladay , Yet never wronged my Queen , in all my life : My God , I did offend , which gives me at my end , May all the rest amend , I do forgive them . To the State I never meant ill , welladay , welladay , Neither wished the Commons ill , in all my life : But lov'd all with my heart , and always took their part , Whereas there was desert , in any place . Then mildly did he crave , mournfully , mournfully , He might that fovour have , private to pray : He then prayed heartily , and with great ferver To god that sits on him [ e ] for to receive him .
