A most sweet Song of and English Merchantman , born in Chichester . To and excellent new Tune , etc A Rich merchantman there was , that was both grave and wise , Did kill a man at Embden Town , through quarrels that did rise , Through quarrels that did rise ; the Germane being dead , And for that fact the merchantman was judg'd to loose his head : A sweet thing is love , it rules both heart and mind , There is no comfort in the world to women that are kind . A scaffold built was , within the marketplace , And all the people far and near , did thither flock apace : Did thither flock apace , this doleful sighed to see , Who all in velvet black as jet , unto the place came he : A sweet , etc Bear headed as he was ; his hands was bound before , A cambrick ruff about his neck , as white as milk he wore : His stockings where of silk , as fine as fine might be , Of person and of countenance , a proper man was he : A sweet , etc When he was mounted up upon the scaffold high , All women said , Great pity it was so sweet a Nan should die : The merchant's of the town , from death to set him free , Did porffer there a thousand pound , but yet all would not be : A sweet thing is love , it rules both heart and mind , There is no comfort in this world , to women that are kind . The prisoner hereupon , began to speak his mind , Quoth he , I have deserved death , in conscience I do find : Yet soar against my will , this man I kill'd , quoth he , As Christ does know , which of my soul must only Saviour be : A sweet , etc With heart I do repent this most unhappy deed , And for his wife and children small , my very heart does bleed : The deed is done and passed , my hope of life is vain , And yet the loss of this my life , to them is little gain : A sweet , etc Unto the widow poor , and to the babes therefore , I give a hundred pound a piece , their comfort to restore : Desiring at their hands , no one request but this , They will speak well of Englishmen , though I have done amiss : A sweet thing is love , it rules both heart and mind , There is no comfort in this world , like women that are kind . This was no sooner done , but that to stint the strife , Four godly maids did proffer him , for love to save his life : This is our law , quoth they , we may your death remove , So you in lieu of our good will , will grant to us your love : A sweet , etc Brave English-man , quoth they , 'Tis I will save thy life ; Nay , quoth the second , it is I , so I may be thy Wife ; 'Tis I , the third did say ; Nay , quoth the fourth , 'tis I , So each one after the other said , still waiting his reply : A sweet , etc Fair maidens every one , I must confess and say , That each of you well worthy is to be a lady gay : And I unworthy far , the worst of you to have , Though you have proffer'd willingly my loathed life to save : A sweet thing is love , it rules both heart and mind , There is no comfort in this world , to women that are kind . Then take a thousand thanks , of me a dying man , But speak no more of love or life , for why my life is gone : To Christ my soul I give , my body unto death , For none of you my heart can have , sith I must leave my breath : A sweet , etc Fair maids lament no more , your country law is such , It takes but hold upon my life , my goods it cannot touch : Within one chest I have in gold a thousand pound , I give it equal to you all , for love that I have found ; A sweet , etc And now dear friends farewell . sweet England now adieu , And Chicester where I was born , where first this breath I drew : And now thou man of death , unto thy weapon stand . O nay , another damsel said , sweet Headsman hold thy hand : A sweet , etc Now hear a maiden's plaint , brave English-man , quoth she , And grant me love for love again , that craves but love of thee : I woo and sue for love , that had been woo'd e're this , Then grant me love , and therewithal she proffer'd him a kiss : A sweet thing is love , it rules both heart and mind , There is no comfort in this world to women that are kind . I'll die within thy arms , if thou wilt die , quoth she , Yet live or die , sweet English-man i'll live and die with thee . But can it be ( quoth he ) that thou do love me so ! 'Tis not by long acquaintance , sir whereby true love does grow : A sweet thing is love , it rules both heart and mind , There is no comfort in this world to women that are kind . Then beg my life , quoth he , and I will be thy own , If I should seek the world for love more love cannot be shown : The people at that word , did give a joyful cry , And said , Great pity it was so sweet a man should die : A sweet , etc I go my love , she said , I run , I fly for thee , And gentle headsman spare a while my lover's head for me : Unto the Duke she went , who did her grief remove , And with a hundred maidens more she went to fetch her love : A sweet , etc With music sounding sweet , the foremost of the train , The gallant maiden like a bride , did fetch hem back again ; Yea , hand in hand away they went unto the church that day , And they where marry'd presently in sumptuous rich array ; A sweet , etc To England came he then , with his fair lady bride , a fairer creature never lay by any merchant's side ; Where we must leave them now , in pleasure and delight , But of their names and dwelling I must not here recite . A sweet thing is love , it rules both heart and mind , There is no comfort in the world to women that are kind . London : Printed for A.M.W.O. and T.
