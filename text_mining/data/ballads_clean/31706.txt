She made her plumb pottage and sweet minc'd-pies , The rost-beef was laid down when she did rise ; Dinner was ready , and lik'd so well , Not one among twenty could Joan excel ; They prais'd her so much that Joan grew proud , And then she began to prate aloud , I will have a husband oft she cry'd , A pretty youngman [ tO ] oh lie by my side .
