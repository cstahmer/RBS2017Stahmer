The Hackney Damsels PASTIME , OR , A S ummer E vening FROLLICK . To a pleasant new Tune , much in Request . This may be Printed , R.P. [ 1 ] ONE Evening , in hight weather , I through a Grove did pass , And saw two Maids together , fit sporting on the grass : I stood a while and eyed them , They little thought who spied them . While they were imitating What I'll forbear relating . [ 2 ] When their Pastime was over , I gently trod the green , To surprise them and discover , that their Frolic I had seen , The one more nimble sighted She run as if she was frighted ; The other not surmising , I caught her just a Rising . [ 3 ] And down again I plucked her , while she cried fie upon't ; And quickly did instruct her in what young Maidens want . The other at a distance , Came not to her assistance ; But stamping , stood and said , Ah Moll , you're a wicked Jade . [ 4 ] You foolish Girl , come hither And do as I have done ; I'm sure that you had rather be kissed , than let alone : He hath got in his Breeches For Maids , a bag of Riches , Which when you've in possession , You'll think it no transgression . [ 5 ] With that the Wench drew nigher , and I to meet her run ; Whose heart was set on fire with standing to look on . I on the grass did throw her , And soon began to show her , The pleasing toil of Nature , That's loved by every Creature . [ 6 ] She every moment kissed me , and clasps me in her Arms ; And cried , you powers assist me , to exercise new Charms , While we our Joys were sharing , The other she [ s ] at staring ; Which put me in m [ ind ] [ to ] think on , How the Devil looked over Lincoln . [ 7 ] When our delights were [ e ] over she blushing to me cried , Good Sir , do not discover what freedoms you've enjoyed , For when my Mistress knows it , She'll take me to her Closet , And beats me in her Anger For kissing with a stranger . [ 8 ] I all assurance gave her , I'ld keep it in my breast ; She asked me if I'ld have her , I answered yes in Jest ; The other in a fury : Cried Oh h you idle Whore you , He's a Man that I have right in , And so they fell to fighting .
