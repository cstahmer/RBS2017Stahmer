RUTLAND's Bounty : OR , BASLOW BELLS . COME -- Now let us sing to the Honour , And fame of our excellent Friend ; To RUTLAND our Duke and great Donor , Let's Bumper about without End. CHORUS . Let's ever remember great RUTLAND , In Glasses fill'd up to the Brim , For seek through the Kingdoms of Britain , You'll find but few Nobles like him . This Favour so kind undertook , Shall echo from Rocks and from Hills ; ( To publish the Fame of the Duke , ) Excited by Voices and Bells' . Then let's , etc We'll merit as much as we can , For what we deserve we shall have Of RUTLAND ; -- for he is the Man That's generous , friendly and brave . Then let us , etc The Records of this present Age , To all Generations will tell ; Who finish'd this musical Cage , By giving a FIFTY POUND BELL . Then let us , etc When Taxes and Tolls do advance , By War interrupting the Peace ; Great RUTLAND defrays the Expense , His well belov'd Tenants to ease . Then let us , etc The MINER's of every Hill , Where Homage to RUTLAND is du [ e ] Do feel the kind Acts of his Will , And kindly acknowledge 'em too . Then let us , etc To GRANBY we'll drink a deep Toast , And to each other Branch of his Grace : Of the SQUIRE at Hassop we'll boast , And Bumper him round in due Place . Still let us , etc To th' STEWARD we'll fill up a Cup , Of the best this Place does afford ; To him we'll bottom it up , As Friend both to Tenant and Lord . Still let us , etc To all who have freely paid down , We'll Tipple their Healths in one Sum ; But of those who have lack'd that Renown We'll ever be silent and mum . Still let us , etc Well furnish'd with Bells' , we'll rejoice , And sing of the DUKE whom we prize ; His Dignity stirs up each Voice , To Trumpet his Fame through the Skies . Then let us , etc His Health and Prosperity still , Deep stamp'd on our Hearts will remain ; For when he receives good or ill , We share of the Pleasure or Pain . Then let us , etc RUTLAND's Bounty : OR , BASLOW BELLS .
