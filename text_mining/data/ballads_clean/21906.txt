The young Gallants Tutor , Or , And Invitation to Mirth . Here is and Antedote against all sadness , And a sweet Motive unto joy and gladness , For mirth does to our lives such pleasure bring , It makes us live as happy as a King , From our before father's we this Maxim borrow , And ounce of Mirth is worth a pound of Sorrow , Tune of , The Delights of the Bottle . With Allowance , A Way with the causes of riches and cares , That poison our spirits & amp ; shorten our years He that does fit musing over ill got wealth It pleases his fancy but ruins his health , Then perish all fops by sobriety dulled while he that is merry reigns Prince of the world . Mirth cherish [ s ] life in the old and the young , And makes every minute both happy and long , For he that's inclined to be sober and sad , A thousand to one but in time he'l grow mad , Then perish all fops by sobriety dulled While he that is merry is Prince of the world He that's but endued with one scruple of wit , Can tell you that mirth like a Monarch does fit , Inthroned in a palace of pleasure and ease , To welcome young Gallants and Ladies to please Then perish all fops by sobriety dulled , While he that is merry reigns Prince of the world The life of Canary does cherish our Souls , While that we carouse it in plentiful bouls It fills us with courage both active and free , And fits us for service in every degree , Then perish all fops by sobriety dulled , While he that is merry reigns Prince of the world We keep Ladys company just when we please , And Rovel like princes in pleasure and ease We pass the time merrily day after day , And month after month till the years slides away Then perish all fops by sobriety dulled While he that is merry reigns prince of the world The mighty god Cupid and Baccus agree , To crown with delight all the noble and free , When Venus grows froward because she's so fair We then to the tents of great Baccus repair , Then perish all fops by sobriety dulled while he that is merry reigns Prince of the world . With Love and good Liquour our hearts we do cheer Canary and Claret Cock Ale and March beer , It 'twere not for these we should have a dull sense Of what shall betide us a hundred year hence , Then perish all fops by sobriety dulled . While he that is merry reigns prince of the world The joys of good fellowship keeps us alive , The more we do fuddle the better we thrive , To Frolic all day makes us sleep well at night , Our stomachs are full though our heads may be light Then perish all fops by sobriety dulled While he that is merry reigns prince of the world Flint Glasses and Bottles are pleasant to view To see the wine sparkle and of a brisk hue , Will tempt a dull miser as much as his gold But that he's afraid to be poor when he's old , Then perish all Fops by sobriety dulled , While he that is merry reigns prince of the world What strange opposition in nature we find , That some all their life time to mirth are inclined Whilst others fit moping and neds must confess They have no enjoyment of what they possess , Then perish all Fops by sobriety dulled , While he that is merry reigns prince of the world The pleasant debauches of love are most sweet , When passion and Guineyes with bueaty we meet But yet the good sack is of noble renown , And pleases as well as the Miss of the Town . Then perish all Fops by sobriety dulled , while he that is merry reigns Prince of the world Since Tippling and kissing does now rule the roost Of freedom and pleasure we bravely can boast , Whilst he that is sullen and knows no delight , Oppressed is with sorrow by day and by night , Then perish all Fops by sobriety dulled , While he that is merry reigns Prince of the world Then for to conclude since that mirth does prevail To mighty Sack bottle weel drink without fail , Lets hug our delight that the health may go round In which all our sorrows and cares we will drowned Then perish all Fops by sobriety dulled While he that is merry reigns Prince of the world .
