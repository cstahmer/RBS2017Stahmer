Damsels Complaint FOR THE Loss of her Maidenhead : With Allowance . Tune of Liggan Water . O cruel and unhappy Fate , How fair a Maid was I of late , But losing of my Maidenhead , My true Love he is from me fled . I fear my Fortune now is [ sp ] oiled , Since that I am half gone with Child , It fills my heart with grief and woe , Because I don't the father know . How many Sweethearts Courted me And always loving , kind and free , They gave me Cakes and Kisses to , And often did Loves game renew . Kind William set me on his knee , Who did so kiss and smuggle me , That soon he did my heart betray , A [ ass ] no one could say him nay ; Then after him n [ you ] forty more [ r ] e , Told me that they did [ me ] adore My pretty b [ l ] ack and charming eyes Until they had obtained the Prize , But since I do begin to swell , In troth they bied me all farewell , There is not one the Child will own And I am left to [ sighs ] alone Their ttrades [ & amp ; ] callings [ I ] will name The [ first ] a Black smith in [ ? ] He brought his hammer in his hand , I fell for want of strength to stand . When I was down he thumped me Then [ ? ] up [ I scarce ] could go . All this I took and never Cried Yet still the pain lies in my side A Jolly Joyner six foot high , He was the next that did come by , His tools he brought , one , two & amp ; three , And all to do a job for me . Then smerking Dick the bakers man He promised me gloves , muff and fan If that I would but once prove kind [ Then ] straight he god me in the mind Am nimble Taylor brisk and brave Was full of [ ringies ] and did crav [ e ] One loving [ kind ] and tender kiss , What I gave more you all may guess Then he took measure with his yar [ worser ] For Gown and mantua , but I fear ' [ worser ] He would mistake and vex me for In making them two short before . Then straight there was a bricklaye [ r ] came But I have quite forgotten his Name I liked not very well his tricks , He laid me stones instead of Bricks To tell you all have wronged me , Too tedious to relate would be , But since its gone and passed who ca [ n ] [ Undo ] what here was done by man Then to the smith I went my way And unto him with Tears did say Alas the Child I have is thine , But still he was not of my mind . His Answer was to me again , Why should you thus disputing stand I'll own the Child for to be mine ; If born with hammer in his hand . Thus all the rest [ ? ] me so And who to [ fix ] on I don't know Its a hard [ fate ] now I'm defiled No Dad I can get for my Child Now Virgins all before you part with [ this ] [ same ] Jewel next your heart Before you know your Lovers well , Or Father's you will want like Nell .
