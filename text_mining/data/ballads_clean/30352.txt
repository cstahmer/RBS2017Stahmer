Trial brings truth to ligh OR , The proof of a pudding is all in the eating . A dainty new ditty of many things treating , To the tune of the Begger-boy . THe world hath allurements and flattering shows , to purchase her Lovers good estimation , Her tricks and devices hee's wise that well knows , the learn'd in this science are taught by probation : this truth when I find , it puts me in mind , Among many matters which I am conceiting , of one homely adage , that's us'd in this mad age , The proof of a pudding is all in the eating . Although this my subject seem homely and mean , yet you that with judgement will construe the matter , Some ears of good documents from it may glean , Which I from this sheaf of invention will scatter : now cunning and fraud wins greatest applaud , And under wits cloak many shelter their cheating , but try and then trust , for the world is unjust , And the proof of a pudding is all in the eating . The knave and the honest man both are complete , in gesture , in words , and in company keeping , Nay commonly they who do mean most deceit , more easily into men's bosoms are creeping : with counterfeit tales , which too much prevails , And proffers of courtesy often repeating , but speak as you find , and still bear in mind , That the proof of a pudding is all in the eating . Men's promises may be compared to snow , or ice at the best , by cold weather congealed , They're hard in the morning , at noon nothing so , though with protestations their minds are revealed : yet when the hight beams , of disastrous streams , Does melt their intentions , then they'l be fleeting , their words differ clean , from what they do mean , But the proof of a pudding is all in the eating . There be of both sexes that have fair outsides , like Jays with the feathers of Peacocks adorned , A fair suit of Scarlet , or Plush , often hides a carcase infirm , with diseases deformed : and now in these times , men cover their crimes , With shadows of virtue , their brains still beating , which way to do nought , and yet hide their fault , But the proof of a pudding is all in the eating . There's many thrasonical prattling Jacks , that upon their Alebench will tell brave discourses , Were Ajax alive they would not turn their backs , their tongues shall supply the defect of their purses : But take them at their words , they'l scant draw their swords , Instead of bravadoes they fallen to entreating : but give me that blade , that does more than he said , For the proof of a pudding is all in the eating The second part To the same tune . WHen I do want nothing I have store of friends , I mean friends in shadow but nothing substantial : If I will believe every one that pretends , I shall have more courtesy than any man shall : But when I have need to use them indeed , Like cowardly soldiers they fallen to retreating , but he is my friend , that helps me i'th end , For the proof of a pudding is all in the eating . There's many in company boast of their skill , in wonderful mysteries secret and hidden , You may give belief to their words if you will , upon winged Pegasus oft they have ridden : if any in place will unto their face Oppose them with boldness , their projects defeating , their courage will quail , and they'l tell a new tale For the proof of a pudding , etc I have seen a Gallant attyr'd like a Lord , yet often through want hee's inforct to be sparing : Hee's daily a guest at Duke Humphryes board , and sometime he fills his belly with swearing : I have seen likewise , a plain man in freeze , Or good mutton-velvet that glisters with sweating , he calls and he pays , and he means as he says , Thus the proof of a pudding is all in the eating . Theres many that when they affliction do feel , as poverty , sickness , and other disasters , Then unto their friends they will humbly kneel , and say , under heaven they are their best master's : but when through those friends their misery ends , Ingratefully all former kindness forgetting , they them do disdain , who did them maintain , Thus the proof of a pudding , etc There are many men when they first come a wooing to Widows or Maidens with great protestations , Such wonderful courtesies they'l then be showing , and they silly creatures believe their relations : their love's very hight , until they have god The thing that they wish by their subtle entreating , then they prove unkind , and poor women do find That the proof of a pudding is all in the eating . Thus briefly and plainly I have here expressed , my mind and conceit of this proverb so homely , Wherein at the truth very near I have guessed , and decked it in ornaments decent and comely : I hope it will fell abroad very well , With those who love truth , and abhor all cheating , till trial be made , no more can be said , For the proof of a pudding is all in the eating .
