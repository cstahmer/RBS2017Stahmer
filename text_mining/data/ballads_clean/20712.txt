THE bad Husband's Information of ill Husbandry ; Or , He goes far that never turns . SHOWING , How a Good-fellow spent most of his Estate , But did repent before it was too late : Wishing all others to take warning by this , And strive in time to mend what is amiss , To the Tune of , Digby's Farewell : Or The Jovial Crew . Y Ou bonny boon blades that are company keepers , Come hither and listen unto this my Song , All you that strong Liquour do love for to tipple , It's unto you that these Verses belong : It's known a bad Husband I have been all my life , But now i'll be loving and kind to my Wife ? For surely I thought it would never be day . Until I had brought my Estate to decay . I have spent all my treasure , and wasted my time ; In keeping of Company both night and day , And my loving Wife she would often come to me , Saying Thomas come hither and here what I say : But I never regarded the words that she told , So long as my Money and Credit would hold : For surely I thought etc . Sometime to the Market I would go and fell A Quarter of Barley . or Wheat of the best , And when that my pockets with money were filled , My heart and my mind could take little rest ; But unto the Alehouse I straight would away , And there peradventure all night I would stay : For surely I thought etc . And when that I unto my Hostis did come , I would call for a Flagon and a private room ; Then her daughter Katherine would wait me upon , And instead of a Flagon she brings me a Gun : My Hostis she presently smiled in my face , For she knew I would call for my Liquour apace , I would pay for it roundly and down with my Dust , For I found that my Landlady cared not to trust . I N singing and dancing was all my delight , And there I would tarry from morning till night ; I would have the Music unto me to play , And thus I did tipple my money away : I should have a Girl to fit on my knee , Oh such foolish fancies have beggared me : For surely etc . But my Wife and Children I left them at home , Still waiting and wailing when I did come , To bring them provision , or Clothes to their back , For I knew very well that such they did lack ; But thouhg I did know it , I never took care , Though their bellies did pinch & amp ; their backs did go bore ; So I had but Liquour to fill up my skin , I never regarded what case they were in . And when that I late came home in the night . With my wife and my children straight would I fight And as soon as I put my feet in the door : I should out with my purse and call my wife Whore ; At these urging speeches she would fit and cry , The more silly Rascal and Drunkard was I : For to abuse her that was my best friend , But now I'm resolved in time for to mend . For I see if a man do spend all that he have , At last they will count him but a drunken Knave ; They will point their fingers as he does pass by , Saying there goes a Drunkard , and so he will die ; Therefore all bad Husbands take warning by me , Lest that you do bring your selves to poverty : For surely I thought , etc . For the other day as I passed up the Town , I met with my Hostis in her silken Gown , With the Knees of my breeches and elbows burst out But she was so ready to give me aflout , I could not get a Flagon of Beer at her hands , Though with her I had spent my house , goods & amp ; lands : It made me to sighs and am ready to cry , Oh what and ill Husband and Drunkard was I ; But if I had been ruled by my Wife at the first , I might have had silver and gold in my Purse , To maintain good housekeeping , & amp ; children at nurse , But I hope it will mend when it is at the worst ; I am resolved now to led a new life , And ever be loving and kind to my Wife : For it makes me to sighs and am ready to cry , Oh what and ill Husband and Drunkard was I ; Now I am resolved a new life to begin , The Alewife shall , carded and her daughter shall spin , Before I will be any more such a Mome , I'll be a good Husband , and tarry at home ; It's not their fair speeches that shall me entice , Nor bring me again into Fools Paradise : For it makes me to sighs and am ready to cry , Oh what and ill Husband and Drunkard was I ? Youngmen and had Husbands take warning by me Lest that you do bring your selves to poverty ; And in your expenses pray be not to bold , But lay up your Money against you are old ; Be sure do not spend your Money in vain , But keep it in your Purse your charge to maintain : Then you will not be forced to sighs and to cry , Oh what and ill Husband and Drunkard was I . Concluding these Verses , which here I have penned , I hope that no honest Man here I offend : Then read them , and buy them , and bear them away , And like to me do not wander astray ; The price is a Penny , and it is not dear , For there's many a Penny spent worse in the year ; And if that you chance to take warning by it , I think you've and excellent pennyworth of Wit , FINIS Printed for P.
