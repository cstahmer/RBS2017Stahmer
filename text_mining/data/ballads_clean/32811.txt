ON THE Duke of MARLBOROUGH . A POEM . By CHARLES DIVE , Gent. --------- Extinctus amabitur Idem . AS late I walk'd beside that Silver Spring , Where oft I've herd the Sister Muses sing , While all the Nymphs and Fairies mov'd their Feet To the soft Measures of their Music Sweet ; So Woe be gone , the Mirthless Dams I found ; All Nature seem'd to sympathise around ; To Notes so Joyless each attun'd her Voice , The Plaintive Stream roll'd down with Troublous Noise : Such moving Sounds ne'er thrill'd a Mortal's Ears , Since their own SPENCER sung their Hapless Tears . As VENUS , sprung of no Terrestrial Seed , When she beheld her Lov'd ADONIS bleed , The Purple Flood recalling to her Mind , The Thousand Pleasures she no more must find , With Ruthful Dole bewail'd her Lifeless Joy , Then curs'd the Hated Boar , and hugg'd the Boy . So mourn'd this Sacred Brood of Heav'nly JOVE , Such was their Sorrow , and no less their Love : MARL - MARLBRO' the Lov'd ADONIS of the Throng , Essence of Fame , and Ornament of Song , Who erst their Panting Steed so oft employ'd , Seizing the WOLF was by the BOAR destroy'd . Hence springs their Grief , hence flows this baleful Stream , Conquests no more shall be the Joyful Theme . Empires redeem'd , and Tyrants brought to Shame , No more shall burst the Golden Trump of Fame : The Beardless God may break his useless Lyre , Great Deeds no more shall Sounding Verse inspire ; And thou Majestic Pile ! Preserve thy Spoils , The Noblest Record of all Manly Toils ; For ISTER'S Wave no more shall Crimson flow , Nor shall thy Walls another BLENHEIM show . FINIS .
