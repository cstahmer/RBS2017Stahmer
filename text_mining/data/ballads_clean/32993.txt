The World turn'd upside down OR , Money grown Troublesome . Showing the vanity of youngmen , who spend their youthful days in rioting and wantonness , which is undoubtedly the Highway to want and Beggary , as you may plainly see in these following lines , wherein the Extravagant does not only lament his mispent time , but also gives advice to others , to prevent those mi - series which befell him by his profuse spending till too late he sees his error . Tune of , Packingtons Pound . I Am a young blade that had money good store But now by debauchery grown very poor When I had enough to have served my turn O then in my pocket my money did burn Then straightway I hunted to find out good fellows , And could not endure to be out of and Alehouse , But by Whoring and Drinking I now am undone , And now I am laugh'd at , by everyone . And when I was drunk I must needs have a whore , By which means I quickly consumed my store ; For I met with a Wench with her powdered locks , And she for my love furnish'd me with the Pox : The pains were so great that I could not endure : The Chirurgeon he would be well paid for his cure . So by whoring and drinking I quite was undone , And now etc With strong protestations she vow'd to be true , Who was both a Whore and a Pickpocket too , And when she was gone , to the Tavern I went , To drink of the best then it was my inten But when I my reckoning did come for to pay This whore she had stole all my Money away , So I god the Pox and my money was gone , And now etc I' th' Alehouse and Tavern I took my delight , And seldom lay from them by day or by night ; By which means I now am reduced so low , That I by their doors in danger do go : For now they do tell 'tis justice and reason They should have their money , and I lie in Prison , Thus whoring & drinking it has me undone , And now etc My Comrades with whom I my money had spent , And daily was used with them to frequent , They scoff and do jeer as I by them do go , And look on me as if they did me not know : Which adds to my sorrow , my trouble , and grief , Yet cannot by any means find me relief : For 'tis whoring and drinking that has me undone , And now I am laugh'd at by everyone . And since I do find how I now am despised I wish all youngmen would by me be advised , And if you in youth may be blessed with store , Oh! keep from and Alehouse and mind not a whore : And then you will find how your stock with increase , Your lives be a comfort , your conscience at peace : But by whoring and drinking I now am undone , And now etc The readiest road to destruction I think , Is for poor heedless youngmen like swine for to drink , For they by this means all their senses do drown'd , And do both their souls and their bodies confound : For a man that is drunk has no reason at all , And into all kind of temptation does fallen ; For by whoring & drinking myself I've undone , And now etc When a Whore does but light of a man that's in drink His Coin is her own she does presently think , She fawns on him then , and she plays with his hair And he being drunk is soon caught in a snare : But while she does give him a kiss or a smile Be sure of his Money she does him beguile : Thus by whoring & drinking I am quite undone , And now etc Then do not you question what I write to you , For woeful experience does tell me 'tis true , And I that for folly so dearly have paid Thereof would have other men be afraid : I heartily wish that my vain wanton doing Might prove as a means to prevent others ruin . For by whoring & drinking I am quite undone , And now etc There's no man does know but he that hath try'd , When poverty comes how the friendship's deny'd ; And those unto whom you were formerly kind , Greatest strangers will seem you will certainly find . But be wise in your youth & your friends will remain Who , if you grow poor , will your folly disdain : For by whoring & drinking I am quite undone , And now I am laugh'd At by everyone .
