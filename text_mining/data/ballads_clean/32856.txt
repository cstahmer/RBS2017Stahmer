A SATYR . HIS Holiness has Three Grand Friends On our Great Britains shore , That promote his ( and their own ) ends , A D. a Judge , a Whore . The D. is true as Stubborn-Steel To the Pope , that Infallible Elf ; Therefore no Friend to Common Weal , More than unto himself . The Judge is a base Butchers Son , Most shy of nocent Blood ; But for Ten thousand pound has done The Pope a deal of good . 'Twas he that Villain Wakeman clear'd , Who was to have Poyson'd the King , As plain to all but Twelve appear'd ; For which he deserves to swing . Then Portsmouth's Frenchified-Bitch , That Damn'd Papistick-Drab ; And ugly , and most nasty Witch , Eat up with Mange and Scab . This French Hag's Pocky Bumb So pow'rful is of late ; Although it is both Blind and Dumb , It Rules both Church and State . A SATYR .
