THE School of Venus . When lusty Lads and Lasses meet , and Merrily do Play ; The Pleasures are so strong and sweet , both Sexes Love obey . To the Tune of , Hail to the Myrtle Shade . H Owe long shall I sighs and mourn , and part with my sorrowful tears , How long shall I live forlorn ; possessed with troubles and fears , Now , now I do vow and protest , the Torment is great that I feel ; And I am debarred of rest , my sorrows I cannot reveal . O who could imagine that love , should prove [ s ] such a terrible pain , There's nothing my pangs can remove : while my love he does show me disdain , For passion grows stronger , and stronger , and let me do all that I can ; That [ e ] se plagues I'll endure no longer , but will have a bout with a man . Though Father and Mother persuade , their labours will prove but in vain , My thinks Ime too [ oh ] ld for a Maid , all people they will me disdain : My ma [ i ] den head I will not keep , what ever to me does de [ c ] idem , I never shall quietly sleep , till I have a stout lad by my side O happy are those that are wed , and nigh [ tO ] l [ y ] do [ ta ] st of that bliss , For want of which I am half worser [ ea ] worser , and hardly can meet with a kiss : No creature was ever more [ r ] e vexed , then I [ f ] or the want of a man : But I'll be no longer per [ p ] lext , I'll have one this night if I can . There's many more younger then I have tasted what I do so want , It makes me put finger in eye , to think that youngmen are so scant : And my heart it is ready to burst since I can no comfort enjoy Of Virgins I sure am the worst with me there is none that will toy , A young man that herd her complain , unto her did hastily go , He told her heeed ease her of pain ; and banish [ h ] er sorrow and woe : He catched her fast hold in his arms ? and gave her sweet kisses good store , She freely could put up these harms , by no means sheeed give over . At last he so wanton did grow , that nothing could serve but the bed : She tO [ h ] i [ tO ] her did willingly go , and parted with her maiden head Such kissing and cl [ ip ] ping was there , the like was s [ carce ] ever before , The youngster could no [ tO ] forbea [ r ] ? while she cried for more and for more , But when she the youngster had tamed , his courage began to grow cool , His eagerness then she much blamed and told him he did like a fool Had you fair and softly gone you might have continued till night , But when you were forced to be gone you robbed me of Joy and delight . And every minute said she to me will appear as a year Till again I do dally with thee who now art my Joy and my dear No pleasure before that I knew , could be half so pleasant as this Quoth she I'll thy courage renew , by the charms of and amorous kiss . About his neck she laid her arms , till kisses had made him half mad , And by the force of her charms , had wearied the young wanton lad Then sighing to her he did say , I now must be forced to give over , No longer the wanton I'll play , this time I can kiss thee no more .
