JOCKEY and WILLY , The SCOTCH Rivals : OR , MOGGY'S Constancy . A Pleasant SONG . To and excellent New Tune : Or , King William's March in Flanders . Licensed according to Order . I. I'm love my dear Moggy , said Jockey , so fair , So bright are her Eyes , and so shining her Hair , I'm gang o'er the World , if she'd love me again , But ah ! she loves Willy , I see it too plain , What then must I do , must I'm languish and die ? Nay , rather to gain her , my broad Sword I'm try ; If Willy be conquer'd , my Manhood may prove A reason that Moggy poor Jockey may love . II Geud Faith here he comes , where the Deel in such haste ? To Moggy I'm warrant then ganging so fast ; Says Willy , where else but to Moggy's kind Arms , Where kissing , embracing , I'm melt with her Charms , While on her soft Bosom , my Head I do rest , I'm more than a Monarch do think I am bles Says Jockey , these Favours to me are most due , I'm saw her , and lov'd her , long time before you . III . With Curds , and with Cream , I have treated her long , I'm Piped to her often , and Sung her a Song , And thought she had lov'd me , till you came to Woo With new Fashion'd Plad , on your Bonnet so Blue , But I'm not endure it , your broad Sword lug out ; Says Willy , I fear you not , tho' you're so stout , And often have worsted for Moggy I'm seet , And rather than quit her , I'm dee at her Feet . IV. Their dreadful Blades then they with Fury did wield , And by often wounding , did all bloody the Field , But as Willy fainted , poor Moggy came by , And run in between with a piteous cry , Their Swords not regarding , but void of all fear , Oh Villain , said she , will you murder my Dear ? Then took she the Sword from her Willy's faint hand , And 'twixt him and Death most courageous did stand . V. When Jockey confounded at what he had done , Retir'd without speaking , yet scarce he was gone , But o'er her poor Willy she weeping did fallen , And gave him a Thousand kind kisses withal , Her Hair , and her Linen , she tore off with speed , To bind up the Wounds that so sadly did bleed ; When kisses reviv'd him , she Sighing did say Ah Willy for loving , thou dearly dost pay . VI . But o cruel Jockey ! how durst you impart A Wound to the Man that is lodg'd in my Heart , Thou couldst not fauce Loon bereave him of breath , But at the same time give Moggy her Death , So link'd to each other , our Lives do remain , That Death striking one , will be sure of the twain , Cheer up my dear Willy , to make thee now well , My Wheel , Churm , and Cheesefat , and Wiggan I'm fell . VII . At this he look'd up , and did bless his kind Fate , That it had design'd him so constant a Mate ; Scarce kisses would give them the time more to speak , While Moggy to Crown him , a Garland did make : Poor Jockey saw this , from a Brake were he stood , And grieving for shedding a true Lover's Blood , He hasted , and on his Knees pardon did crave , The which on Conditions as freely they gave . VIII . That he never more should oppose the design They had in sweet Wedlock's embraces to join , Nor envy their Happiness , Joy , and Delight ; Quoth Jockey , Deel take me if ever I Fight , Or trouble my Thoughts about Moggy again , In much love may they for ever remain : Then Home they did go , with such kindness , and joy , That Envy , nor Jealousy , ne'er can destroy .
