The Bachelors feast , OR , The difference betwixt , a single life and a double : being the Bachelors pleasure , and the married men trouble , To a pleasant new tune called , With a high dildo , dill . AS I walked forth of late , where grass and flowers spring , I herd a Bachelor , within and Harbour sing , The tenor of his song , contain'd much melody , It is a gallent thing , to live at liberty , With high dill do dill , high ho dildurtie : It is a delightful thing , to live at liberty . W [ ? ] e Bachelors can flaunt , in Country and in Town , And in good company , may merrily spend a crown : we may do as we list , our lives from cares are free , O' this a gallant thing , to live at liberty , With high dill etc No Cradle have we to rock , nor Children that do cry , No land-Lords rend to pay , no Nurse's to supply : No Wife to scold and brawl , now we still keep good company With them that take delight , to live at liberty , With high dill , etc While married men do lie , with worldly cares oppressed , we Bachelors can sleep , and sweetly take our rest , Oh married men must seek , for Gossips and a Nurse , Which heavy makes the heart , but light it makes the purse , With high dill , etc For Candle and for Soap , and many knacks besides , For Clouts and swaddling bans , he likewise must provide , To pay for sops and wine , he must also agree , Oh 'tis a delightful thing , to live at liberty , With high dill , etc A man that does intend , to led a quiet life , Must practise day and night , to please his longing wife . New fashions must be had , as off as she them see , O 'tis a pleasant thing to live at liberty : With high dill , diil , high , hoe , dildurly , It is a delightful thing : to live at liberty .
