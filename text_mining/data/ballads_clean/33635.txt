A Tragical BALLAD Of the Unfortunate LOVES of Lord THOMAS and Fair ELEANOR : TOGETHER WITH The Downfall of the BROWN GIRL . LORD THOMAS he was a bold Forester , And a chacer of the King's Deer ; Fair ELEANOR was a fine Woman , And Lord THOMAS he loved her dear . Come riddle my riddle , dear Mother he said , And riddle us both in one , Whither I shall marry with Fair ELEANOR , And let the BROWN GIRL alone ? The BROWN GIRL she has god houses and lands , And Fair ELEANOR she has god none ; Therefore I charge thee on my Blessing , Bring me the BROWN GIRL home . And as it befell on a high holiday , As many more do beside , Lord THOMAS he went to Fair ELEANOR , That should have been his bride . But when he came to Fair ELEANOR's bower , He knocked at the ring ; Then who so ready as Fair ELEANOR , For to let Lord THOMAS in . What news , what news , Lord THOMAS she said , What news hast thou brought unto me ? I am come to bid thee to my wedding , And that is sad news for thee . O God forbid ! Lord THOMAS she said , That such a thing should be done ; I thought to have been thy bride myself , And Thou to have been the Bridegroom . Come riddle , my riddle , dear Mother , she said , And riddle it all in one Whither I shall go to Lord THOMAS's Wedding . Or whither I shall let it alone ; There's many that are our Friends , daughter , And many that are our Foes ; Therefore I charge you on my Blessing , To Lord THOMAS's Wedding don't go . There's many that are our Friends , mother , If a thousand were our Foes ; Betide me Life , betide me Death , To Lord THOMAS's Wedding I'll go . She clothed herself in gallant Attire , And her merry Men all in green ; And as she road thro' every place , They took her to be some Queen . When she came to Lord THOMAS's gate , She knocked at the Ring ; And who was so ready as Lord THOMAS To let Fair ELEANOR in . Is this your bride Fair ELEANOR said , Methinks she looks wondrous Brown ; Thou might'st have had as fair a Woman , As ever trod upon the ground . Despise her not , Lord THOMAS he said , Despise her not unto me ; For better I love thy little finger , Than all her whole body . This BROWN GIRL had a little penknife , Which was both long and sharp , And betwixt the short Ribs and the long , She prick'd Fair ELEANOR to the heart . O Christ ! now save me , Lord THOMAS he said , Methinks thou look'st wondrous van ; Thou used'st to look as good colour As ever the sun shin'd on . O art thou blind , Lord THOMAS she said , Or can'st thou not very well see ? O dost thou not see my own heart's blood Run trickling down my knee . Lord THOMAS he had a Sword by his side , As he walked about the hall , He cut his bride's head from off her shoulders , And he flung it against the wall . He set his sword upon the ground , And the hilt against his heart ; There never were three lovers sure , That sooner did depart .
