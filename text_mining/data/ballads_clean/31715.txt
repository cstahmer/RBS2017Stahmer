[ A Courtly new ballad ] of the princely wooing of the fair Maid of London , by King Edward . The Tune is , Bonny sweet Robin . FAir Angel of England thy beauty most bright , Is all my hearts pleasure , my joy and delight , Then goant me swett Lady thy true love to be , That I may say welcome good fortune to me . The Turtle so chaste and true in her love , By gentle persuasions her fancy will move , Then be not entreated fair Lady in vain , For nature requires what I should obtain . The phone [ i ] x so famous that lives alone , Is vowed to chastity to being but one , But be not my darli [ n ] g so changed [ a ] st in desire , Lest thou like the phoenix dost penance in fire . But alas gentle L [ a ] die I pi [ tO ] ty thy state , In being resolved to live without Mate , For if of our cour [ tO ] I [ n ] g the pleasure thou knew , You would have a liking the same to ensue . Long time I have sued the same to obtain , Yet I am requited with scornful disdain , But if you will grant your good will unto me , You shall be advanced to Princely degree : Promotions and honour may often entice , The chastest that lives though never so nice , What woman so worthy but could be content To live in a Palace where Princes frequent . To brides young and princely to church I have led Two Ladies now lately h [ a ] we decked my bed , Yet hath thy love taken more root in my heart , Then all their contentment's whereof I have part . Your gentle heart cannot men's tears much abide , And women least angry when most they do chide , Then yield to me kindly and say that at length Men do want mercy and poor women strength . I grant that fair Ladies may poor men resist , And Princes may conquer and Love who they list A King may command her to lie by his side , Whose feature deserveth to be Kings bride . In granting your love you shall purchase renown , your head shall be deck'd with Englands fair crown thy garments most gallant of gold shall be rought , If true love with treasure with thee may be bought Great Ladies of honour shall tend on thy train , Most richly attired with Scarlet in grain , My Chamber most princely thy person shall keep , Where Virgins with music shall rock thee asleep . If any more pleasures thy heart can invent , Command them sweet Lady thy mind to content , For Kings gallant courts where princes do dwell Affords such sweet pastime as Ladies love well . Then be not resolved to die a true M [ a ] id , But print in thy bosom the words I have said , And grant a King favour thy true love to be . That I may say welcome sweet Virgin to me . The Fair maid of Londons answer to King Edwards wanton Love . O wanton King Edward thy labour is vain , To follow the pleasure thou canst not attain , With getting thou loosest , and having dost wast it , the which if thou purchased is spoil'd if thou hast it . But if thou obtainest it thou nothing hast wone , And I losing nothing yet quite am undone , But if of that jewel a King do deceive me , No K can restore though a Kingdom he give me . My colour is changed since you saw me last , My favour is vanished my beauty is past , The Rose read blushes that sat in my cheeks , To paleness is turned which all men dislikes . I pass not what Princes for love do protest , The name of a Virgin contents me best , I have not deserved to sleep by thy side , Nor yet to be counted for King Edwards bride . The name of a Princess I never did crave . No such tipe of honour thy handmaid will have , My breast shall not harbour so lofty a thought , Nor be with rich proffers to wantonness brought . If wild wanton Rosamond one of our sort , Had neved frequented K. Henries brave Court , Such heaps of deep sorrow she never had seen , Nor tasted the rage of so jealous a Queen . All Men have their freedom to show their intent , They win not a woman except she consent ; Who then can impute to them any fault ? Who still go upright until Men do halt . This counted a kindness in men for to try , And virtue in women the same to deny , For women unconstant can never be prov'd Until by their betters therein they be mov'd . If women and modesty once do but sever Then farewell good name and credit for ever , And Royal King Edward let me be exil [ ' ] worser , Ere any Man knows my body's defil'd . If women and modesty once do but sever , Too deep and impression within my heart bears , Nor shall his bright honour that blot [ b ] y me have , To bring his grey hairs with grief to the grave . The heavens forbid that when I shall die , That any such since upon my soul should lie , If I hhve thus kept me from doing this since , My heart shall not yield with a Prince to begin . Come rather with pity and weep on my tomb , Then for my birth curse my dear mother's womb , That brought forth a blossom that stained the tree , With wanton desires to shame her and me . Leave me most noble King tempt not in vain , My m [ i ] lk-white affection with lewdness to stain , Though England will give me no comfort at [ all , ] Yet England will give me a sad [ burial . ] [ A Courtly new ballad ] of the princely wooing of the fair Maid of London , by King Edward .
