A Song in Praise of the Leather Bottle . Showing how Glasses and Pots are laid aside , And Flaggons and Noggins they cannot abide ; And let all Wives do what they can , 'Tis for the Praise and Use of Man ; And this you may very well be sure , The Leather Bottle will longest endure : And I wish in Heaven his Soul may dwell ; That first devised the Leather Bottle . To the Tune of , The Bottel-maker's Delight , etc GOd above that made all things , The Heavens the Earth , and all therein , The Ships that on the Sea do swim . To keep the Enemies out that none comes in ; And let them all doe what they can , This for the Use and Praise of Man : And I wish in Heaven is Soul may dwell , That first devised the Leather Bottle . Then what do you say to those Cans of Wood ? In faith they are , and cannot be good ; For when a Man he does them send To be filled with Ale , as he does intend ; The Bearer falls down by the way , And on the ground the Liquour does lay ; And then the Bearer begins to ban , And swears it is long of the Wooden Can ; But had it been in a Leather Bottle , Although he had fallen , yet all had been well : And I wish , etc Then what do you say to those Glasses fine ? Yes , they shall have no Praise of mine ; For when a Company they are set For to be merry , as we are met ; Then if you chance to touch the Brim , Down falls the Liquour and all therein ; If your Tablecloth be never so fine , There lies your Beer , Ale or Wine : It may be for a small Abuse , A young Man may his Service loose : But had it been in a Leather Bottle , And the Stopple in , then all had been well : And I wish , etc Then what do you say to these black Pots three ? True , they shall have no Praise of me , For when a Man and his Wife falls at Strife , As many have done , I know , in their Life ; They lay their Hands on the Pot both , And loath they are to loose their Broth ; The one does tug , the other does ill , Betwixt them both the Liquour does spill ; But they shall answer another Day , For casting their Liquour so vainly away : But had it been in the Leather Bottle , They might have tugg'd , till their Hearts did ache , And yet their Liquour no harm could take : They might have tugg'd , till their Hearts did ache : Then I wish , etc Then what do you say to the Silver Flaggons fine ? True , they shall have no Praise of mine ; For when a Lord he does them send To be filled with Wine as he does intend ; The Man with the Flagon he does run away , Because it is Silver most gallant and gay : Oh then the Lord he begins to ban , And swears he hath lost both Flagon and Man ; There is never a Lord's Serving man , or Groom , But with his Leather Bottle may come : Then I wish , etc A Leather Bottle we know is good , Far better than Glasses or Cans of Wood , For when a Man is at work in the Field , Your Glasses and Pots not Comfort will yield ; Then a good Leather Bottle standing him by , He may drink always when he is a dry ; It will revive the Spirits and comfort the Brain , Wherefore let none this Bottle refrain : For I wish , etc Also the honest Sith-man too , He knew not very well what to do , But for his Bottle standing him near , That is filled with good Household-beer : At Dinner he sits him down to ear , With good hard Cheese , and Bred or Meat ; Then this Bottle he takes up amain , And drinks and sets him down again ; Saying , Good Bottle , stand my Friend , And hold out till this Day does end : For I wish , etc And likewise the Haymakers they , When as they are turning and making their Hay In Summer-weather , when as it is warm , A good Bottle full then will do them no harm ; And at Noontime they fit them down , To drink in their Bottles of Ale nutbrown ; Then the Lads and Lasses begins to tattle , What should we do but for this Bottle ? They could not work if this Bottle were done , For the Day's so hight with beatrice of the Sun : Then I wish , etc Also the Leader , Lader , and the Pitcher , The Reaper , Hedger , and the Ditcher , The Binder , and the Raker , and all About the Bottel's Ears does fallen ; And if his Liquour be almost gone , His Bottle he will part with to none , But says , My Bottle is but small , One Drop I will not part withal : You must go drink at some Spring or Well , For I will keep my Leather Bottle : Then I wish , etc Thus you may hear of a Leather Bottle , When at it is filled with Liquour full well , Though the Substance of it be but small , Yet the Name of the thing is all . There's never a Lord , Earl , or Knight , But in a Bottle does take Delight ; For when he is hunting of the Deer , He often does wish for a Bottle of Beer : Likewise the Man that works at the Wood , A Bottle of Beer does oft do him good : Then I wish , etc Then when this Bottle does grow old , And will good Liquour no longer hold , Out of the Side you may take a Clout , Will mend your Shoes when they'r worn out ; Else take it and hang it upon a Pin , It will serve to put many odd Trifles in , As Hinges , Awls , and Candle-ends , For young Beginners must have such things : Then I wish in Heaven his Soul may dwell , That first devised the Leather Bottle .
