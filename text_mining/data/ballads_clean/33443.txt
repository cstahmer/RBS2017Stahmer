Religious Relics , Or , the SALE at the SAVOY ; upon the JESUITS Breaking up their SCHOOL and CHAPPEL . [ 1 ] LAst Sunday , by chance , I Encounter'd with Prance , That Man of Upright Conversation , Who told me such News , That I cou'd not choose But Laugh at his sad Declaration . [ 2. ] Says he , if you'l go , You shall see such a Show Of Relics Expos'd to be Sold , Which from since and Disease Will Purge all that please To lay out their Silver and Gold . [ 3 ] Straight with him I went , Being Zealously bent , Where for Sixpence the Man let me in , But the Crowd was so great , I was all in a Sweat Before the Rare Show did begin . [ 4 ] The Curtain being drawn , Which I think was of Lawn , The PRIEST Cross'd himself thrice , and bow'd ; Then with a sour Face , Denoting his Case , He address'd himself thus to the Crowd . [ 5 ] You see our sad State , 'Tis a folly to prate , Our Church and our Cause is aground ; So in short , if you've Gold , Here is to be Sold For a Guinny the worth of Ten Pound . [ 6 ] Here's St. James's old Bottle , It holds just a Pottle , With the Pilgrim's Habit he wore ; The same Scollop shells , As our Holy Church tells , Who denys it's the Son of a Wh ----- [ 7 ] Here's a piece of the Bag , By Age turn'd to a Rag , In which Judas the Money did bear ; With a part of his Rope , Bequeath'd to the POPE , As and Antidote 'gainst all despair . [ 8 ] Here's a Rib of St. Laurence , 'Tis also at Florence , And it may be in France , or in Spain ; It Cures Stone and Gravel , And Women in Travel It delivers without any Pain . [ 9 ] Here's St. Joseph's old Coat , Though scarce worth a Groat , Its plainness does show he'd no Pride ; Yet this he had on , For beside it he'd none , The day that he Marry'd his Bride . [ 10 ] His Breeches are there , A plain Leather Pair , Come Buy the whole Suit , if you please ; They'l defend you from th' Itch , From Hag and from Witch , And preserve you from Bugs and from Fleas . [ 11 ] Here's the Gall of a Saint , For such as do faint , Or are troubled with Fits of the Mother ; Nay , if your Breath stink , Worse than Closestool or Sink , It will Cure you as soon as the other . [ 12 ] Here's a Prayer of Pope John , The like to't is none , If you say it but three times a year ; Three hundred in grace , And three hundred 'twill place In Heaven , if they ever come there . [ 13 ] Here's our Lady's old Shoo , Which in Oldtime was new , It will Cure all your Kibes and your Corns ; With the Coif of St. Bridget , To be worn by each Idiot , Whose Head is tormented with Horns . [ 14 ] Heres a Bottle of Tears , Preserv'd many years , Of Mary's that once was a Sinner ; Some o' th' Fish and the Bred That the Five Thousand fed , Which our Saviour Invited to Dinner . [ 15 ] Here's St. Francis own Cord , You may take 't on my word , Who die in it cannot be Damn'd ; Do but buy it , and try , If I tell you a lie , Many Thousands of Heaven are shamm'd . [ 16 ] Here's his Holiness's Beard , Of whom you have herd , That the Heretics called Pope Joan , Yet this I dare Swear Was his natural Hair , Or else I'll be Sworn he had none . [ 17 ] Its Virtue is such , That if it does touch Your Head , or your Face , or elsewhere , It does straightway Restore More than e're was before , Though by Age or by Actium worn bore . [ 18 ] Here's St. Christopher's Boot , For his Right Leg and Foot , Which he wore when he ply'd at the Ferry , When on's Shoulders he boar His Blessed Lord o're , For the Poor Man had never a Wherry . [ 19 ) Such as Sail on the Seas , I am sure it will please , For its parallel never was found ; Neither Tempest nor Storm Can e're do 'em harm , Nor is't possible they shou'd be drown'd . [ 20 ] Here's infinite more , I have by me in store , All which lie conceal'd in this Hamper ; Either buy 'em today , Or I'll throw 'em away , For tomorrow , by Heaven , I'll scamper . [ 21 ] Our Market is done , We must Shut up at Noon , We expect 'em each hour at the Door ; We are Hang'd if we stay , And we can't get away , For none will , nor dare carry us o're . [ 22 ] But by th' Faith of a PRIEST , This is no time to jest , Since we're Baulk'd in our great Expectation ; Before I will Swing Like a Dog in a String , I'll Renounce the Transubstantiation .
