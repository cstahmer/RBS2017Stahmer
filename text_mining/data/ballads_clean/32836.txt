THE Jealous LOVER's Complain OR , His Torment for Love of Fair Cloris . Tune of , While I lay gazing , etc WHile I gaze on Cloris trembling , while her looks my face declares . When she smiles I fear dissembling , when she frowns I straight despair , Jealous of some Rivals favour , which her wandering looks can give , Fain I would desire to leave her , but can sooner cease to live . Happy is he whose inclination warms but with a gentle heat , Or flies out into a passion , love's a torment , O 'tis great , When the Storms are once blown over , soon the Ocean quiet grows , But a tender faithful lover never is in true repose . FINIS . Printed for J. Blare at the Looking-Glass on London-Bridge . THE Jealous LOVER's Complain OR , His Torment for Love of Fair Cloris .
