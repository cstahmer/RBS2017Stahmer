And now their death's does meet in one : My griefs are come , my Joys are gone . Then frantically I ran about , Filling the air with mournful groans , Because I had not yet found out The murderers to ease my mones , I rend and tore each thing I god , And said , and did , I knew not what . Thus as I passed the streets , hard by The Duke of Castiles house as then A Letter there I did espy , Which show'd Horatios woeful end . Which Belli [ mp ] eria forth had flung , From prison w [ h ] ere they kept her strong .

Whereto I straight way gave consen Although in heart I never meant . Sweet Bellimperia comes to me , Thinking my son I had forgotten , To see me with his foes agree , The which I never meant God woe But when we knew each others mind , To work revenge a mean I find . Then Bloody Baltazar enters in Entreating me to show some sport , Unto his Father and the King : That to his nuptial did resort . Which gladly I prepar'd to show . Because I knew twoul'd work their woe . And from the Chronicles of Spaine , I did record Erastus life , And [ how the Turke had him so slain ] And straight revenge wrought by his wife . Then for to act this Tragedy : I gave their parts Immediately . Sweet Bellimperia Baltazar kills , Because he slew her dearest friend , And I Lorenzos blood did spill , And eke his soul to hell did send . Then died my foes by dint of knife , But Bellimperia ends her life . Then for to specify my wrongs , With weeping eyes and mournful heart , I shew'd my son with bloody wounds , And eke the murderers did impart . And said my son was as deer to me : as thine , or thine , though Kings you be . But when they did behold this thing . How I had slain their only sons : The Duke , the Viceroy , and the King , Upon me all they straight did run . To torture me they do prepare , Unless I should it straight declare . But that I would not tell it then , Even with my teeth I bit my tongue , And in despite did give it them , That me with torments sought to wrong : Thus when in age I sought to rest , Nothing but sorrows me oppressed . They knowing well that I could write , Unto my hand a pen did reach , Meaning thereby I should recite , The authors of this bloody fetch . Then feigned I my pen was nought And by strange signs a knife I sought . But when to me they gave the knife . I kill'd the Duke then standing by , And eke my self bereav'd of life , For I to see my son did high . The Kings that scorn'd my griefs before , With nought can they their Joys restore . Here have you herd my Tragic tale . Which on Horatio's death depends , Whose death I could anew bewail : But that in it the murderers ends , For murder god will bring to ligh Though long it be hid from men sighed .
