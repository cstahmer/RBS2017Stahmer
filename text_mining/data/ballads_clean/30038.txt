The Maid shows such cause that none can her condemn , But on the contrary the fault's laid on him .

But rail no more on Love , Nor doe young Cupid wrong , For thou didst never prove What does to love belong . Hienna-like thou feign'st words of a dying man , But falsely thou complain'st with woe I prove it can : For like a cheating wretch , thou dost on me exclaim , But this is but a fetch for thou deserv'st the blame . Why dost thou rail on love , Or do , etc Thou knowest I lov'd thee well , and purposed thee to have , Thy conscience this can tell , thou false dissembling knave , But when I did perceive thy fickle wavering mind , It time to take my leave , and serve thee in thy kind . Then rail no more on love , Nor Cupids cruel wrong , For thou didst never prove What does to love belong . Let any one that will be judge betwixt thee and me , Why should I love thee still , when thou lov'st two or three . Dost think I'll stand at stake , to help at the last cast ?

Fie rail no more on love , Nor Cupids cruel wrong , For thou didst never prove What does to love belong . I Cannot choose but smile to think how cunningly Thou wouldst the world beguile with foul hypocrisy : For I the wrong sustain , and thou from grief art free , Yet still thou dost complain that I am false to thee . Fie never rail on love , Nor Cupids crew [ l ] l wrong , For thou didst never prove What does to love belong . To either man or Maid For censure I'll appeal , Which of us may be said disloyally to deal ; Did ever I seem nice till I was told for truth , More oft then once or twice , thou was't a faithless youth . Fie do not rail , etc Thou mak'st the world believe , thou for my love dost pine , Indeed thou soar dost grieve with wenches , Cakes , and wine , For my part this my lot to pray for patience still , Until I have forgotten thy overreaching skill . Then do not rail , etc Yet though I suffer wrong I needs must praise thy art , Sure thou hast study'd long to act the Madmans part , Thou canst not sleep nor wake for fancies in thy head , Now I do thee forsake I muse thou art not dead .
