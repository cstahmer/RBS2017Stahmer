v [ The Hunting of the Hare . With her last Will and Testament . As 'twas perform'd on Bamstead-Downs , By Conny-Catchers , and their Hounds .

I will tell you of a rare Scent , Where many a Gallant Horse was spent On Bamstead-Downs a Hare we found Which led us all a smoking round : Over Hedge and Ditch away she goes , Admiring her approaching foes . But when she found her strength to waste She parlyed with the Hounds at last ; Kind Hounds ( quoth she ) forbear to kill , A harmless Hare that never thought ill And if your Master sport do crave , I'll led a Scent as he would have .
