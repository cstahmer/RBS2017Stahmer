H : 135102 A PANEGYRICK POEM ON THE Coronation OF The Illustrious and Serene , JAMES II King of Great Britain , France , and Ireland . etc LEt Subject's sing , Bells' ring , and Cannons roar , And every Ship come dancing to the Shore , To Crown Great JAMES with everlasting Bays , And to his Worth and Hecatombs of Praise ; That Loyalists may their Allegiance pay , And flourish forth the Triumph of this Day Which mitigates our Moan , the Rod to kiss ; And gives our Grief more than Parenthesis . Black sable Night , and Shades , eclips'd our Sky , When Royal CHARLES the Good and Great did die : But radiant Beams Great Britain's Haven now clears , Since Phoebus-JAMES behind the Cloud appears , Scattering the Vapours of sad Sighs , to make His Joyful CROWN our Nations Zodiac . The King of kings did Graciously design Him Martial , Mild , Majestic , and Divine . Ne'r had A'suerus half of his Renown , Nor Pomp , nor Splendour , hanging on his Crown . His Queen's like Esther , for Majestic Grace Darts from her eye , and shines o'r all her face : In Parts , and Person she does well agree With her great Stem , and noble Pedigree . His Subject's are more Valiant , ( yea , by far ) Than was Achilles in the Trojan War. Brittain's a Microcosm , a Fertile Plain , Or Eden's Map , environ'd by the Main : Her King's a Monarch , and none dare withstand His Force of Arms by swelling Sea , or Land : When Lunacy o'rshadow'd Britains Crown , He gain'd abroad the Garland of Renown . And ( as St. George the Dragon ) James does put The Viper of Sedition under Foot . But there's no Need to show His Majesty With Beams I borrow from his Twilight Sky ; Let this suffice : JAMES , Brother , and the Son Of Charles , [ ah Charles ! ] hath now his Reign begun . Retire then Rebels , till our Voice we raise , In Yorkshire Hoes , and Plaudities of Praise . By Peter Ker.
