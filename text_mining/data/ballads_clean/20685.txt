To the Tune of , Oh Man in Disperation . A Wake , awake , Oh England , sweet England now awake And to thy Prayers speedily , do thou thy self betake ; The Lord thy God is coming within the Sky to clear , Repent therefore Oh England , the day that draws near . The dreadful day of vengeance , is shortly now at hand , When fearful burning fire , shall waste both Sea and Land ; And all means hearts shall fail them to see such things appear , Repent , etc The wordly wise and prudent , shall fallen beside their wits , And wish the Hills to fallen on them , in these their frantic fits : No succour , help nor comfort , for them shall then appear , Repent , etc The Seas and Rivers running , shall rear in grievous wife , The Beasts in Pastures feeding , still strain forth grievous cries . The Skies shall flame with fire , the Earth shall burn so clear , Repent therefore Oh England . the day it draws near .

B Ut such as have done justly , shall wear the Crown of Life ; The wicked shall be Damned , to sorrow , pain and grief : In boiling brans of Brimstone , with doleful heavy cheer , Repent therefore Oh England , the day it draws near . But woe unto that woman , which then with Child shall go , And to the silly Nurse's , which do give Suck also , When as the day of Judgement so grievous shall appear , Repent , etc And pray with tears most constant , unto the Lord of might , That in the frozen winter you do not take your flight : Nor that upon the Sabbath , that peril do appear , Repent , etc Let all good Christian people , repent therefore in time ; And from their hearts lamenting , each former grievous crime : Prepare themselves with gladness , to watch when Christ shall come ; The trump shall found , and sudden , and no man knows how soon : Repent , etc For all things are fulfilled , which Christ before had told , Small Faith is now remaining , and Charity's grown cold ; Great signs & amp ; wonders we have seen within the Earth and Sky , Repent , etc Why dost thou put thy confidence in strong and stately Towers , Why takest thou such pleasure , in building sumptuous Bowers : Rejoicing in thy Pastures , and Park of fallow Dear ; Repent , etc Why seekest thou deceitfully to purchase treasure great , Or why does thou through Usury , the bred of poor Men eat ? Why does the life and living , so filthily appear ; Repent , etc Wherefore let all good people upon their knees proceed , In making earnest Prayer for never was more need ; That God may spare the punishment even for his mercy mere , And give Grace to bear in mind , the Judgement day is near .
