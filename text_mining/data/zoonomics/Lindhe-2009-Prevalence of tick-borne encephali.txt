Abstract
Background: Large regions of central and eastern Europe are recognized as areas where tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is endemic, including countries neighbouring Denmark. It is
therefore timely and relevant to determine if TBEV infections occur in Denmark. This study
investigates the presence of antibodies against TBEV in a cross-section of the Danish canine
population to assess the level of exposure to TBEV and possibly identify TBEV microfoci in
Denmark.
Methods: Blood samples were collected from 125 dogs originating from five regions of Denmark
between November 2005 and March 2006. Serum was tested by indirect ELISA. All positive and
borderline samples were re-evaluated by neutralisation test (NT).
Results: The prevalence of TBEV serocomplex antibodies was 30% by ELISA and 4.8% by NT (with
100%-neutralising capacity). The island of Bornholm was the only area in Denmark with NT positive
samples.
Conclusions: The island of Bornholm is an area with a high risk of encountering TBEV microfoci.
The presence of TBEV serocomplex antibodies in many sentinel animals from other parts of
Denmark points toward existence of other TBEV microfoci. Discrepancies found between ELISA
and NT results stress the importance of careful evaluation of serological tests, when interpreting
results.

Introduction
Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a flavivirus, is the
cause of the most important arthropod-borne viral disease
in central and eastern Europe. It is believed to result in at
least 3000 human cases of tick-borne encephalitis annu-

ally in Europe [1,2]. TBEV is transmitted to mammals,
birds, reptiles and amphibians by ticks of the Ixodes family, predominantly by Ixodes ricinus [3,4]. The virus causes
not only severe meningitis, meningoencephalitis and
numerous deaths, but can also induce long-term debilitat-

ing complications in patients that survive a severe form of
the disease [3,4]. Canine TBE is characterized by lower
morbidity, but a higher mortality rate, than human TBE,
and dogs are often euthanized because of the severity of
their clinical manifestations [4,5]. There is no cure for
infection with TBEV and apart from the use of hyperimmunoglobulins in humans over the age of 14 [6], symptomatic therapy is the only means of providing patient
support.
Viral existence and the maintenance of TBEV microfoci
not only require a microhabitat favorable for Ixodes ticks,
but suitable hosts and host population dynamics are also
important [7,8]. Factors including habitat, seasonal variation and vector-host interactions contribute to the transmission of TBEV. Ixodes ricinus exist throughout Denmark
and TBEV microfoci have been predicted in many parts of
the country, which has raised concern about the establishment of TBEV in areas other than Bornholm [9]. Environmental change to warmer and more humid conditions
encourages the spread of tick habitats and establishment
of new TBEV microfoci, which pose the threat of new and
more abundant infection centers [10].
In Denmark, TBE was first discovered in 1963 on Bornholm, an island of 588 km2 located in the Baltic Sea [11].
At the time when this study was performed, Bornholm
was the only location in Denmark where TBEV microfoci
had been documented [12,13]. TBEV serocomplex antibodies had, however, been detected in Danish wildlife,
indicating that TBE transmission occurred in other areas
than Bornholm [14] and, during the summer of 2009,
TBEV was found in Ixodes ricinus ticks in Northern Zealand
[15].
The aim of this study was to examine Danish dogs for
serological evidence of infection with TBEV and to estimate the prevalence of TBEV serocomplex antibodies in
the animals tested. Furthermore, the study intended to
identify the location of potential TBEV risk areas in Denmark as well as possible risk factors associated with a positive titer in dogs. Finally, the use of anti-TBEV enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in dogs was evaluated for sensitivity and specificity based on the results of
the anti-TBEV neutralization test (NT).

Methods
Study population and materials
The investigation was designed as a cross-sectional study,
where dogs were used as sentinel animals and screened for
presence of antibodies against TBEV. The study population consisted of clinically healthy dogs. Animals were
recruited from five veterinary clinics from different
regions of Denmark (Figure 1). Only dogs over the age of
4 years, and weighing more than 15 kg, were included
because dogs of this age and size were more likely to have

previously visited typical tick habitat such as fields or
woodlands. Dogs that had previously travelled to TBE
endemic areas outside of Denmark were excluded from
the study. For each dog, the following data were collected:
place of origin (owner's postal address), sampling month,
age, breed, gender and degree of sample haemolysis.
Blood was collected in serum tubes and sent to the Central
Laboratory, University of Copenhagen. The samples were
centrifuged at 2560 g for two minutes (Heraeus Multifuge
1 S-R) and the serum was transferred to small vials, which
were kept at -18°C until the time of analysis.
Canine TBEV antibody positive blood samples were
obtained from the University of Veterinary Medicine,
Vienna, Austria and used as positive controls. Negative
control samples were collected from young, small breed,
urban-dwelling dogs from Copenhagen that had never
travelled.
Serology
TBEV serocomplex antibodies were detected by a modified indirect ELISA. The ELISA kit, Enzygnost® Anti-TBE
virus (IgG, IgM; Dade Behring, Deerfield, IL, USA; User's
Manual March 2005 p.1-16) intended for use in humans
was used in combination with anti-dog IgG conjugate
(Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA) at a dilution
of 1:20,000. Canine serum samples were diluted to 1:40.
To test the accuracy of the method and the micro titration
plates, human negative and positive samples were
included in each plate. Human control samples were
diluted 1:20, as recommended by the manufacturer. All

procedures were performed manually and antibody titer
was determined by absorbance of samples in a spectrophotometer with a filter wavelength of 450 nm (Multiscan
Ascent V1.24, Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham,
MA, USA). All samples were analysed in duplicate.
ELISA cut-off levels were determined using the manufacturer's recommendation and individual cut-off levels were
set for each micro titration plate. Sample results were
divided into three groups: negative, positive and borderline, with a cut-off value ≤ absorbance of sample ≤ cut-off
+ 0.1, as defined by the user's manual. Positive and borderline samples were sent to the Medical University of
Vienna, Austria for double-testing by NT, carried out as
described by Holzmann and colleagues [16]. Samples
with 100% neutralising capacity, measured as = 1:10 in
titer level, were considered NT positive. In addition, 5 randomly chosen negative samples were also sent to assess
the sensitivity of the ELISA.
Statistical analyses
Association between selected potential risk factors such as
location (postal address), sampling month, age, breed,
gender and degree of sample haemolysis and TBEV antibody level was investigated using descriptive and statistical analyses (SAS® 9.1 software and Fisher's exact test for
statistical significance). The mean, median, standard deviation and variance of titer were determined by Proc Univariate. The extent of interaction and confounding was
evaluated in a generalized linear model (Proc Mixed and
Proc Genmod). NT results were analyzed using the frequency tables (Proc Freq). Finally, by comparing the
results of the ELISA and NT, the specificity and sensitivity
of the ELISA was assessed.

had previously travelled to Bornholm. The five seropositive samples from Bornholm correspond to a regional
seroprevalence of 31%. The three ELISA negative samples
and two negative controls tested by NT were truly seronegative. The sensitivity of the ELISA was found to be 100%
and the specificity 57.6% under the assumption that all
68 ELISA negative samples were negative.
The age of the dogs ranged from 4 to 15 years with an average of 7.5 years. The average age of ELISA positive dogs
was 8.1 years. Although not statistically significant (P =
0.0647), the risk of having developed antibodies against
TBEV increased with the age of the dog (Figure 2).
Gender had a statistically significant correlation with titer
(P = 0.0014 by Fisher's exact test). Sixty per cent (39/65)
of the female samples were positive or borderline compared to 29% (17/59) of the male samples. One sample of
unknown gender was omitted from the statistics. Dog
breed and level of sample haemolysis was not statistically
correlated with titer. No interaction or confounding bias
was indicated between any of the investigated influencing
factors (age, month, place of origin, gender). Using the NT
data, the only significant influencing factor was place of
origin i.e. the owner's postal address (P < 0.001 Fisher's
exact test).

Discussion
Our study assessed the prevalence of antibodies against
TBEV in a cross-section of Danish dogs to be 4.8% by NT.
By means of a modified, indirect ELISA, a seroprevalence
of TBEV antibodies was found in 30.4% of the dogs. This
prevalence is higher than that found in dogs by a similar
method in Norway (16.4%) [17] and that found in
humans in TBEV endemic areas in Sweden (12%) [18].

Results
A total of 125 canine blood samples were obtained. Of the
125 samples collected, 38 were positive for TBEV serocomplex antibodies and 19 were categorised as borderline. Figure 1 shows the veterinary clinics where samples
were collected.
ELISA positive samples were found in all regions of Denmark included in the study, but a greater number of positive samples originated from Bornholm, where 50% of the
ELISA samples were positive, compared to 34%, 30% and
21% on Zealand, Funen and Jutland. No statistically significant correlation was found between location (dog
owner's postal address) and a positive titer (P = 0.1916 by
Fisher's exact test).
Analysis of all ELISA samples showed a seroprevalence of
30.4%. Only six samples (4.8%) were NT positive. Five of
the ELISA and NT positive samples were from dogs living
on Bornholm. The sixth dog originated from Zealand, but

The seroprevalence found in the present study may be
higher than that found in Norway because of a more widespread TBEV infection of ticks or because of differences in
study population, i.e. greater number of urban dogs in the
Norwegian study, or resulting from the possible presence
of cross-reactive viruses in Denmark. Seroprevalences of
30-32% have been observed among roe deer (Capreolus
capreolus) and forest workers on Bornholm [12,13,19].
Similar to this, we found a seroprevalence of 31% in dogs
originating from Bornholm.
As argued in other studies of tick-borne diseases, the use
of sentinel animals to indicate presence of an infectious
agent is rewarding [14,17,20,21]. Dogs are good hosts for
ticks because they move through undergrowth and tall
grass at the right height for tick nymph and adult attachment. Our findings of antibodies against TBEV in Danish
dogs indicate a risk for humans when passing through the
same TBEV-infected tick habitats that lead to the infection
in dogs.
Although the ELISA titer outcome was not statistically significant, the number of positive samples increased with
increasing dog age. Antibodies are known to remain in circulation for extended periods of time and can therefore
accumulate, resulting in the highest titers in elderly individuals [22,23]. The average age of positive dogs found by
ELISA was 8.1 years, which is consistent with a similar
study in Norway [17].
Our study showed a considerable discrepancy between
ELISA and NT results. The NT revealed a prevalence of
100% neutralising antibodies in 4.8% of the dogs. This is
much lower than that found by ELISA. Although ELISA is
known as the method of choice for the detection of TBEV
specific antibodies in serum [24], our study shows that
use of ELISA as the sole serologic diagnostic method when
testing dogs may be insufficient. The sensitivity of the
ELISA kit, when used in humans, was reported to be
99.5% and the specificity, to 96.8% [17]. A recent evaluation of the ELISA kit in humans [25] showed sensitivity at
84% and specificity of 78%. In light of the recent discovery of TBEV infected ticks and associated human cases
(not evaluated by NT) on the island of Zealand, which
had high ELISA anti-TBEV antibody titers, it is reasonable
to speculate that these are real TBEV infections that have
not lead to the production of neutralizing antibodies
detectable by the methods used in this study. The occurrence of ELISA-positive dog sera and lack of NT positive
samples from Zealand might be caused by changes in antigen profile during serial passage in the tick population
(transovarial transmission [26]), which are reactivated by
passage through mammalian hosts. However, at this time
we can only speculate about the cause and note that high
ELISA titers may have preceded the finding of human

cases. Finally, studies on the prevalence of TBEV in Denmark are consistent with the emergence, disappearance
and reoccurrence of TBEV microfoci, as has been reported
from other parts of Europe in recent years [10,27].

Conclusion
This study confirms that the island of Bornholm is a TBEV
risk area in Denmark. Furthermore, our results suggest
that the existence of TBEV microfoci in other parts of Denmark is likely. The study also emphasizes the need for
careful evaluation of serological tests when interpreting
results in the clinic.
