The new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease accounts for no
relative increase of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease mortality rate in
the United Kingdom; this fits ill with the new variant being the
consequence of consumption of food infected with the agent of
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy

Abstract
Background: A new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was described in the United Kingdom.
It is often claimed that it is caused by consumption of food infected with the agent of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy. However, this remains open to question because the number of cases
of the variant is, at the present time, less than would be expected from a major food-borne source.
Discussion: The EUROCJD cooperative study presents currently available epidemiological data of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and its new variant, for nine European countries plus Australia and
Canada. Unexpectedly, for the United Kingdom where all but a few cases of the new variant have
been reported, these cases have to be included in the incidence curve of the sporadic forms of the
disease in order to obtain the best fit with the median curve from all the countries. This variant
could be merely a rare clinical phenotype within the sporadic disease. The published clinical and
experimental data which suggest that it is linked with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, lead us
to propose that this link could be a common etiological origin other than consumption of bovine
infected food. In any case, public health recommendations hold and further investigation is
required.
Summary: The lack of a relative increase of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob-disease mortality rate in the
United Kingdom, does not fit well with the new variant being the consequence of consumption of
food infected with the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopthy.

Background
A new variant (nvCJD) of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)
involving ten initial cases [1], was clinically described in
the United Kingdom (UK) in 1996, shortly after the epizootic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the
UK. The isoform of the prion protein from this new variant has physicochemical properties, distinct from other

strains of CJD, that resemble what is found in BSE [2]. The
results of experimental transmission to mice are consistent with the BSE prion being the source of this new disease [3]. Altogether, these results led many people to
claim that BSE caused variant CJD [4], assuming that
nvCJD is caused by consumption of BSE-infected food.

However, it appears that this link between the BSE prion
and the nvCJD remains open to question [5–7]. The shape
of the epizoic curve of BSE in the UK [4] suggests a major
food-borne infection and it is presumed that the general
British population has been exposed to the BSE prion.
However, the nvCJD is to date a rare disease that is predominantly found in young people. The current shape of
the epidemic curves has suggested that nvCJD is not
caused by consumption of BSE infected food [5]. However, human exposure to BSE could depend on a range of
unknown variables, so that extrapolation from conventional food-borne epidemics to nvCJD could appear to be
somewhat simplistic [6]. A so-called back-calculation
analysis (assuming a mean incubation period well
beyond the human life-span) showed that these curves are
compatible with this hypothetic food-borne infection [8].
The aim of this paper is to continue the debate on this
issue as has been suggested [5], in the hope of stimulating
new ideas that could fit the whole of the epidemiological,
clinical and experimental data that are now available.
The EUROCJD project started in 1993 http://
www.eurocjd.ed.ac.uk/sporadic.htm, and compares data
from national registries in Australia, Austria, Canada,
France
http://www.invs.sante.fr/publications/mcj/
donnees_mcj.html, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK http://
www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/figures.htm. We perform here an
exhaustive analysis of the data now available online from
this project. By no means did the nvCJD cases lead to an
increased mortality rate from CJD in the UK as compared
with the other listed countries. The hypothesis that the
emergence of the nvCJD is the consequence of eating BSEinfected meat does not fit well with the data from the
countries covered by the project. However, the two illnesses could have a common etiological origin.

Discussion
Since 1995, apart from six cases in France http://
www.invs.sante.fr/publications/mcj/donnees_mcj.html,
one in Ireland, one still alive in Italy [9], one in the USA
[10], one in Canada http://www.eurocjd.ed.ac.uk/
vCJD.htm, and one in Hong Kong, the new variant of CJD
has been reported only in the UK. It could be expected
that, together with the familiar sporadic CJD, the resultant
epidemiological data would show a significant increase in
the UK as compared with the other countries included in
the EUROCJD cooperative study. However (Table [see
Additional file 1: Table.xls]), taking into account the
respective population sizes, the number of cases in the UK
(nvCJD included), does not differ from that in the other
countries. For Canada, only cases classified as "definite"
were listed and the study was retrospective through 1997,
so that the values were lowered (since 1998, the mortality
rate is 0.73 to 1.04 and fits what is found in the other

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/3/25

countries studied); for Slovakia, the number of cases is too
low for a comparison to be done (1 to 3 cases for a mortality rate of 0.20 to 0.60). In order to focus on the countries that were comparatively studied since 1993, only the
data of the nine other countries included in the EUROCJD
project are presented in the table [see Additional file:
Table.xls] and in the figure. As can be seen in the figure,
the curve corresponding to UK CJD-plus-nvCJD cases
tightly fits the median curve from the nine countries taken
together. If only sporadic CJD is taken into account (broken line), the UK data are visibly lower in that they have
remained stable since 1996 in contrast to the other countries where the values tend to increase. This increase
accounts for the rate of growth of the median curve, which
is consistent with the view that improved ascertainment of
previously misdiagnosed diseases has occurred (but actual
increases of some values cannot be excluded). Differences
in ascertainment are possible between different countries,
but, as a whole, the curves are concordant. An exhaustive
examination of the data shows that, for some countries,
the incidence of CJD can abruptly increase about two-fold
or decrease roughly by a factor of two. But, in contrast
with the UK, these modifications last only one year. For
instance, the absolute number of cases of sporadic CJD in
Australia was 17 in 1993, 11 in 1994, and 19 in 1995; it
was also 27 in 2000 and 14 in 2001. For the Netherlands,
the number of cases was 18 in 1994 and 8 in 1995; it was
19 in 1999 and 11 in 2000. In Switzerland, there were 10
cases in 2000 and 18 in 2001. Poisson distributions do
not account for these discrepancies [11] which rather suggest a clustered distribution of some cases [12]; such a
clustering suggests that CJD could be the sum of clinical
phenotypes with possibly different local etiologies (see
below). Currently, we are not aware of a clustering in the
UK over the past ten years. In any case, this pattern is difficult to prove for such a rare disease.
We have done an additional analysis of the countries in
the NEUROCJD system (Belgium, Denmark, Finland,
Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Norway, Portugal and
Sweden), concerning definite and probable cases (deaths)
of sporadic CJD http://www.eurocjd.ed.ac.uk/sporadic
neuro.htm. This comparative study began in 1997. If all
the values are taken into account (Iceland excluded, with
only one case in 1997 for a population of 272000), the
annual median values are successively 1.02, 0.58, 0.66,
0.81 and 1.24 from 1997 to 2001. It is more appropriate
to focus on the four countries that have a population
greater than Switzerland and a number of cases that permits to obtain reliable annual mortality rates: Belgium,
Greece, Portugal and Sweden. The median is then successively 0.8, 0.9, 0.97, 1.16 and 1.27. These increasing values suggest an improved ascertainment of previously
misdiagnosed diseases as seemed to be the case for the
countries included in the EUROCJD project, from 1993 to

Annual mortality ratio (9 countries). Annual mortality ratios per million (sporadic CJD + nvCJD) for the UK and eight
other countries included in the EUROCJD project (see text). Two curves correspond to the UK data, the nvCJD cases being
excluded from one of them (broken line). The three other curves summarize the data from the nine countries together: for
each year, three values out of the nine observed, are plotted corresponding to the curves Max, for the maximum number, Min
for the minimum value and Median (fifth value or, for 1993, the average of fourth and fifth). The last year indicated is 2001 (statistics as at 31 December 2002, 6 March 2003 for France and 3 March 2003 for the UK)

1997. For the NEUROCJD system, the value obtained in
2001 fits what is now obtained in the EUROCJD project,
so that the same situation seems to exist in the whole
Europe.
Hence, currently available epidemiological data show that
nvCJD accounts for no relative increase of the CJD mortality rate in the UK, which does not fit well with the idea
that nvCJD is the consequence of consumption of BSEinfected food. The clinical and experimental peculiarities
of nvCJD can give the impression that nvCJD is merely a
clinical phenotype within CJD. One can imagine that CJD
cases are the sum of clinical phenotypes the etiologies of
which can differ from one case to another; the relative

proportions of these phenotypes can also fluctuate with
time. Some of these variants could have been previously
misdiagnosed [5], or could be indeed a new disease [6]
(the only two cases of nvCJD in the USA and Canada have
both lived in the UK, which argues in favour of the latter
hypothesis http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/
fs180/en/). The sum of all the cases could be rather constant, perhaps with some fluctuations that could only be
ascertained by a long range and exhaustive study. In order
to account for the clinical and experimental data which
suggest a link between nvCJD and BSE, one could hypothesize a common factor that has been operating independently for BSE and nvCJD. For instance (and among
additional possible etiologies), one can imagine that a

rare subtype of food-borne-sheep-derived scrapie agent
that could have been the source of the epidemic of BSE in
the UK [13], could have been independently the source of
nvCJD for a few human beings, depending upon
unknown and stringent variables. If it is true that CJD in
due to diverse etiologies, this could explain, for instance,
that a country as Australia which is not known to have
scrapie and is at very low risk of BSE, has a mortality rate
for sporadic CJD comparable to the other countries. Actually, a food-borne transmission of scrapie to man has
never been proven on epidemiological grounds. If this
was possible, discovering the BSE prion subtype in a
scrapie sheep would not necessarily imply a contamination of the sheep by BSE. We are not aware that largescale
ongoing studies have led to discover such a subtype at the
present time. In any case, this debate is still open and
other scenarios are possible indeed.
From the current data it is not possible to infer what will
happen in the years to come. The epidemic curve of
nvCJD could eventually take a shape suggesting a foodborne infection possibly caused by BSE-contaminated
food. Alternatively, the numbers of cases of nvCJD in the
UK, that peaked in 2000 (15 deaths in 1999, 28 in 2000,
20 in 2001, 17 in 2002), could continue to decrease. A
recent study suggests that it is actually the case [14]. The
delay of 8 years that separates the major epidemiological
curve of BSE (that peaked in 1992) and the minor curve of
nvCJD is usually taken as demonstrating that BSE has
caused nvCJD. One could also hypothesize that a major
contamination of the bovines in the UK due to waves of
recycling infected cattle waste in meat and bonemeal, has
shorten the incubation for BSE. Concerning prion diseases, public health recommendations hold, but if public
safety is rightly the prime consideration, the debate has to
remain open in order to elucidate the real cause(s) of
these diseases. We have to be concerned that a speculation
could eventually be accepted as a demonstrated fact and
thus close an important debate which still possibly
requires further investigation for a long time.

Authors' contributions
The authors jointly conceived of the idea for this study. A
H hypothesized from the epidemic curves, that nvCJD is
merely a clinical phenotype within the sporadic disease.
This idea was completed by I L, namely that BSE and
nvCJD could have a common etiological origin.

Summary
A new variant of CJD was clinically distinguished from
CJD shortly after the epidemic of BSE in the UK. With the
help of biochemical and experimental data, this led many
people to claim that this variant was caused by consumption of BSE-infected food. However, nvCJD accounts for
no relative increase of the CJD mortality rate in the UK, so
that nvCJD could be merely a subtype of CJD. We hypothesize that CJD could be a set of clinical phenotypes and
that the new variant could be one of these phenotypes
sharing its etiology with BSE, without being caused by
consumption of BSE-infected food. In any case, no definite conclusion can be made at the present time and this
issue deserves further investigation.
