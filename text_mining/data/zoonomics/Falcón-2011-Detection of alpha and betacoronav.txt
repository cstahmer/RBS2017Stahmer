Abstract Bat coronaviruses (CoV) are putative precursors of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV
and other CoV that crossed the species barrier from zoonotic reservoirs into the human population. To determine
the presence and distribution of CoV in Iberian bats, 576
individuals of 26 different bat species were captured in 13
locations in Spain. We report for the first time the presence
of 14 coronaviruses in 9 Iberian bat species. Phylogenetic
analysis of a conserved CoV genome region (RdRp gene)
shows a wide diversity and distribution of alpha and
betacoronavirus in Spain. Interestingly, although some of
these viruses are related to other European BatCoV, or to
Asian CoV, some of the viruses found in Spain cluster in
new groups of a and b CoV.

GenBank accession numbers: Partial sequences of RdRp gene of bat
coronaviruses obtained in this study were deposited in GenBank
under the accession numbers HQ184049 to HQ184062.

The emergence of infectious diseases is a major threat to
global public health in this century (WHO, World Health
Report
http://www.who.int/whr/previous/en/index.html)
and many of these new infectious human diseases are
caused by viruses emerging from wildlife. In the last
50 years, more than 30 new infectious human diseases
have been identified (WHO, World Health Report
http://www.who.int/whr/previous/en/index.html) including
the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The
aetiological agent of this disease was identified as a
previously unknown coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1] and
BatCoV are putative precursors of SARS-CoV [2]. The
outbreak of SARS-CoV and subsequent identification of
two additional human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63[3] and
HCoV-HKU1 [4]) has drawn human and animal health
attention to Coronavirinae subfamily, that includes three
genera, Alphacoronavirus (a CoV), Betacoronavirus
(b CoV) and Gammacoronavirus (c CoV), replacing the
classical groups 1, 2 and 3 [5] (http://talk.ictvonline.org/
media/g/vertebrate-2008/default.aspx).
The relevance and possible re-emergence of the pandemic SARS-CoV and other emerging viruses of zoonotic
origin have activated surveillance systems of hazard agents
in wild animals, including bats. As a result of these studies,
bats have been described as putative reservoirs for some
emerging viruses affecting humans [6]. BatCoV are putative precursors of CoV affecting humans and mammals [7,
8], including SARS-CoV [2] and other CoV that crossed
the species barrier from zoonotic reservoirs into the human
population [9]. In fact, association of some of these CoV to
certain bat species has been suggested [10, 11], reinforcing
the notion that there may be a relationship between some
BatCoV and their hosts. Nowadays the presence of CoV
has been shown in bats in China [12, 13], North and South
America [14–17], Africa [18] and a number of regions in

123

1884

Europe [11, 19–21] but not the Iberian Peninsula (Spain
and Portugal), which is a bridge for European and African
bat populations [22]. Thus, surveillance of wildlife reservoirs of putative zoonotic CoV is necessary, not only to
unveil the ecology of these viruses, but also to permit early
detection of viruses that might pose a threat to human
health.
To determine the presence and distribution of putative
zoonotic CoV in Iberian bats, 576 individuals from 26 bat
species were captured and sampled in 13 different locations
throughout Spain during 2004-2007 (Fig. 1). These samples were collected in the context of bat rhabdoviruses and
lyssaviruses Surveillance Program in Spain. Most of the
sampled bat species are also distributed across Europe, but
Eptesicus isabellinus is a meridional serotine bat restricted
to North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula [23], and Myotis
escalerai is endemic in the Iberian Peninsula. Bats were
caught with mist nets mainly as they left diurnal roost and
by hand with polyethylene butterfly nets within roosts.
Oro-pharyngeal swabs (n=390) between 2004 and 2007 as
well as faecal samples from individual bats (n=216) in
2007 were taken before bats were released (Table 1).
Oro-pharyngeal swabs collected between 2004 and 2006
were preserved in 1 ml of lysis buffer (4 M GuSCN (Sigma),
OS% N-lauroyl Sarcosine (Sigma), 1 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT, Sigma), 25 mM Sodium Citrate and 20 pg/tube
Glycogen (Boehringer Mannheim). Oro-pharyngeal swabs
and faeces collected in 2007 were preserved in both 1 ml of
lysis buffer and 1 ml of viral transport medium (VTM)
(Eagle’s minimal essential medium (EMEM) supplemented
with 10 UI/ml of penicillin, 10 lg/ml of streptomycin,
160 lg/ml of gentamicin, 50 UI/ml of mycostatin and 1% of

bovine serum albumin). All samples were frozen at -80°C
before sending them to the Rabies Reference Laboratory at
the Centro Nacional de Microbiologı́a, ISCIII in Madrid.
Faecal samples were clarified by centrifugation. Total
nucleic acid was extracted from a 200 ll aliquot of each
specimen for PCR assays and the rest were stored to -80°C
in two different aliquots. Final pellets were always resuspended to 55 ll of water.
A pan-coronavirus nested PCR was designed in the
RdRp gene. A total of 5 ll of extracted RNA was added to
45 ll of reaction mixture of OneStep RT-PCR kit
(QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) containing 200 lM
dNTPs and 60 pmol of generic CoV-specific degenerated
primers (forward 50 -CARATGAATYTIAARTAYGC-30
and reverse 50 -TGYTGWGARCAAAAYTCRTG-30 ) and
following manufacturer indications. Amplifications were
carried out into thin-walled reaction tubes (Sorenson,
BioScience, UT) in a PTC-200 (Peltier Thermal Cycler, MJ
Research, Watertown, MA). Nested PCR amplifications
were performed using 2 ll of first amplification product
and 48 ll of reaction mixture containing 60 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 8.5), 15 mM (NH4)2SO4, 200 lM dNTPs (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ), 3 mM MgCl2,
35 pmol of generic CoV-specific degenerated primers
(forward 50 -ATGGGWTGGGAYTAYCCIAARTG-30 and
reverse 50 -ACRTTRTTYTGRWARTA-30 ) and 1.25 U
AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Norwalk). Amplification product size of 512 nt was visualized
by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced directly in
both directions using an automated ABI PRISM 377 model
sequencer. For phylogeny reconstruction, consensus
sequences were aligned together with others obtained from
public genomic databases using the program CLUSTAL X
(version 1.83) (Table 2). A Bayesian phylogenetic inference was obtained using Mr Bayes version 3.1 [24] with
random starting trees without constraints. For the analyses
GTR substitution model, gamma estimation and two
simultaneous runs of 107 generations were done, each with
four Markov chains, and the trees were sampled every 100
generations. Amino acid identity was calculated with
MEGA 4 using the pairwise deletion option. The alignment
comprised the same 396 bp of the RdRp gene used for the
phylogenetic reconstruction.
A total of 26 out of the 30 known bat species known for
Iberian Peninsula were screened for CoV and 14 samples
taken from 9 bat species, all included in the family
Vespertilionidae, were positive for CoV RNA (Tables 1
and 2). Twelve of them were found within faecal samples
(5.5%) of 7 different bat species in 6 locations and two
were obtained in oral samples (0.5%) of 2 other different
species in the same location (Table 1). In view of these
results, it is not surprising that the presence of CoV RNA is
significantly more frequent in faeces than in oral cavity

These samples were collected in different localities than other positive samples with the same number location

(p\0.0001, FISHER EXACT TEST). It is of interest that
none of the viruses has been found in oropharingeal and
faecal samples of the same individual, when both samples
were available. This fact may indicate either that the
infection was at different stage in the different individuals
at the time of sampling or that replication of virus may take
place independently in the intestinal and respiratory tracts
[25]. Most of the CoV RNA sequences found in faecal
samples (83%) correspond to a CoV, the remaining two
belonging to b CoV. All CoV RNAs from oral samples
(100%) were found to contain viral RNA sequences corresponding to a CoV. In agreement with all previous
studies [7], none of the coronavirus detected in Spanish
bats belong to group c.
The phylogenetic analysis of Spanish BatCoV was
performed using 396nt out of the 512 nt RT-PCR amplified

fragments. 116nt fragment information was lost to allowed
us include more sequences from other European countries
and other continents deposited in GenBanK to perform a
meaningful analysis. This small part of the RdRp gene has
been previously used, and sufficiently represents the full
gene information, for phylogenetic analysis of BatCoV [11,
14, 20]
The phylogenetic reconstruction showed 6 different
lineages of Spanish BatCoV (Fig. 2). BatCoV A and B
were closely related to other a BatCoV found in China
[12], although they appeared to display certain genetic
differentiation (Fig. 2). Myotis daubentonii-associated
CoV H, and Pipistrellus-associated CoV K, clustered
respectively with lineages 4 and 3 of a CoV previously
described in Germany and are hosted by the same bat
species or genera [11] (Fig. 2). BatCoV L was closely

132 amino acids are indicated next to the brackets that links every

Alpha and Betacoronaviruses in Iberian bats

related to cluster HKU7 described in China [10]. BatCoV
C, D, E, F, G and I belonged to the same lineage and
showed an intriguing new independent cluster (significant
posterior probability = 0.95) including BatCoV I0 (Fig. 2).
In addition, BatCoV J and M were genetically related to b
CoV, although they did not really associate with any of
their previously described linages. Sequences corresponding to two different groups of CoV were found in the same
bat species (Hypsugo savii) as it was also found for other
bat species elsewhere [12]. Spanish BatCoV described here
were also classified calculating amino acid distances of
these viruses from phylogenetic neighbours and related
reference species [21]. Amino acid distance criteria
recently described for separating RdRp grouping units
(RGU) were adopted [21]. Interestingly, the amino acid
distance criteria ([4.8% for alphacoronavirus and [6.3%
for betacoronavirus) reinforced the presence of the new
group of alphacoronaviruses mentioned above including
Spanish BatCoV C, D, E, F, G and I; and additionally
showed four new tentative groups (Fig. 2). BatCoV A and
B were included in a new alphacoronavirus group and
BatCoV I0 constituted another independent alphacoronavirus group. BatCoV J, and M represented two new betacoronavirus groups and BatCoV H, K and L remained as
part of several established species (Fig. 2).
It has been previously suggested that some CoV associate to certain bat species [10, 11]. However, we found
that different bat species from the same colony or location
harbour CoV of the same genetic lineage (BatCoV A and
B; G and I), indicating a greater diversity and higher
complexity than previously described for the ecology of
BatCoV. Similar exceptions were found in China and
South America [12, 16, 26] and could also be observed
with Australian BatCoV (Fig. 2 and Table 2).
In conclusion, previous studies showed the presence of
BatCoV in Europe. However, to our knowledge, this is the
first report describing the presence of CoV RNA in Iberian
bat species. Phylogenetic data indicate high diversity, wide
distribution and complex ecology of CoV in bats captured
in diverse Spanish locations. The sequences reported herein
provide new insights into the diversity of coronaviruses and
describe new phylogenetic linages that appear to diverge
from all genotypes previously detected in other European
locations. Future studies should clarify whether such
apparently high diversity reflects the bio-geographical
peculiarities of the Iberian Peninsula or not. This study
contributes with a new dataset to the global surveillance of
emerging BatCoV with pathogenic potential in humans.
Our data reinforce the notion that the ecology and transmission of CoV in bat reservoirs is far from being completely understood and that more studies will be necessary
to evaluate the magnitude of the potential threat that these
viruses pose to human health.
