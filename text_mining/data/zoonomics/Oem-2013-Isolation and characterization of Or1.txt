Five cases of orf virus infection in Korean black goats were
diagnosed in our laboratory between 2010 and 2011. One orf
virus (ORF/2011) was isolated from an ovine testis cell line
(OA3.Ts) for use as a vaccine candidate. Sequences of the
major envelope protein and orf virus interferon resistance
genes were determined and compared with published
reference sequences. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that orf
viruses from Korean black goats were most closely related to
an isolate (ORF/09/Korea) from dairy goats in Korea. This
result indicates that the orf viruses might have been
introduced from dairy goats into the Korean black goat
population.

　Members of the genus Parapoxvirus from the Poxviridae
family are oval, enveloped viruses containing a double
strand (ds)DNA genome [13]. This group includes the orf
virus (ORFV), pseudocowpox virus, and bovine papular
stomatitis virus that infect cattle along with the
parapoxvirus of red deer in New Zealand. The major viral
envelope protein B2L and virus interferon resistance (VIR)
genes have been used to measure genetic variation among
parapoxvirus since these genes are a highly conserved
[2,4,8,9,10]. Contagious ecthyma (contagious pustular
dermatitis) is a highly contagious disease that primarily
affects sheep, goats, and wild ruminants, and is
characterized by the formation of papules, nodules, or
vesicles that develop into thick crusts or heavy scabs on the
lips, gingiva, and tongue [4,5,13]. Patients with zoonotic
ORFV infection develop nodular and papillomatous
lesions mainly on the hands, face, and mouth [5,6,13]. The
importance of ORFV has increased recently due to
emergence of this virus in new territories as well as the
occurrence of interspecies infection and reinfection of

animals previously infected [7].
　An outbreak of ORFV infection among dairy goats in
2009 was reported in Korea [12]. Infection with this virus
in black goats had not been previously observed in Korea
prior to the import of dairy goats from abroad. In the
present study, five ORFVs were isolated from Korean
black goats and characterized to evaluate the genetic
relationships between these ORFVs and other strains of
this virus. The complete B2L and VIR genes were
sequenced, and phylogenetic trees were subsequently
constructed.
　Five suspected cases of contagious ecthyma in Korean
black goats were reported in different geographic areas of
Korea between 2010 and 2011 (Table 1). The affected
goats were 6∼12 months old. Heavy scabs on the lips were
observed in all the animals. Dried scabs were collected
o
from the infected goats and stored at −70 C until analysis.
　PCR with OVS- and OVA-specific primers was
performed as previously described [10]. The OVS and
OVA primer sequences were 5´-AGGCGGTGGAATGGA
AAGA-3´ and 5´-CCAGCAGGTATGCCAGGATG-3´,
respectively. Briefly, total viral DNA was extracted from
scab samples using a QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen,

Amplification was performed using a GeneAmp PCR
System 2700 (Applied Biosystems, USA) under the
o
following conditions: preliminary heating at 94 C for 5
o
min; 10 cycles of denaturation at 94 C for 30 seconds,
o
o
annealing at 55 C for 45 seconds, and elongation at 72 C
o
for 1 min; 20 cycles of denaturation at 94 C for 30 seconds,
o
o
annealing at 57 C for 45 seconds, and elongation at 72 C
o
for 1 min; and a final elongation step at 72 C for 5 min.
　Virus was isolated from the clinical scab samples of
Korean black goats. The scab samples were homogenized
mechanically in PBS in a tube using a pellet pestle device
(Kimble Chase, USA). Homogenized samples were
o
centrifuged in 4 C at 3,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant
was then passed through a 0.45-µM filter (Millipore) and
used to inoculate ovine testis cells (OA3.Ts) (ATCC). The
cell cultures were incubated in Dulbeccos modified Eagles
o
medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37 C in 5% CO2 and

three blind passages were performed until cytopathic
effects (CPEs) were observed. The ORFV was isolated in
OA3.Ts cells and propagated in Madin-Darby bovine
kidney (MDBK) cells (ATCC).

　Also, the homogenates were centrifuged in 4 C at 3,000 ×
g for 5 min. The supernatant was then collected and
negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid for
electron microscopy.
　PCR for the phylogenetic analysis was performed using
previously described primers [4,8]. The amplified products
were purified using an Agarose Gel DNA Extraction kit
(INtRON, Korea) and cloned into a pGEM-T vector
(Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Automated nucleotide sequencing of the VP60
gene insert was performed using an ABI 3130XL Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA) with a BigDye
Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems,
USA). The sequences were confirmed by three or more

independent reactions in both directions. Published
parapoxvirus sequences were retrieved from GenBank
(National Center for Biotechnology Information, USA) for
phylogenetic analyses.
　B2L and VIR gene sequences of the Korean ORFV
strains were aligned with the corresponding parapoxvirus
sequences using Bioedit software (Ibis Biosciences, USA).
A phylogenetic analysis was conducted using Bioedit
software and Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis
(MEGA) 4.0 software with bootstrap values calculated
from 1,000 replicates [14]. The neighbor-joining method
was used for tree construction.
　Cases of ORFV infection at five black goat farms were
diagnosed and confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing.
The amplified PCR products were separated by
electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide
staining. The size of the amplified PCR product was 708
bp. One ORFV strain (ORF/2011) was isolated from
clinical samples from the infected black goats. CPEs were
first observed 6 days after the cell cultures were passed
twice, and typical parapoxvirus CPE patterns, indicated by
cell rounding, pyknosis, and cell detachment, were
observed.
　Negatively stained ORFV particles were examined by
electron microscopy. The particles had an oval-shaped
morphology characteristic of parapoxviruses. Viral
particle size was approximately 150∼200 nm (data not
shown).
　An additional PCR assay was performed to obtain the
full-length B2L and partial VIR gene fragments for
sequencing. The amplified PCR products were 1206 bp for
the full-length B2L gene and 552 bp for the partial VIR
gene. The DNA was purified and sequenced for
comparative analysis. Sequence comparison of the five
Korean ORFV strains (contained one ORFV isolate)
identified from Korean black goats demonstrated a high
degree of identity between each virus and a previously
reported ORF/09/Korea strain [12]. Results of the
phylogenetic analysis based on the complete B2L gene
(Fig. 1A) demonstrated that the five ORFV strains were
most closely related to the ORF/09/Korea strain identified
in 2009 and the Taiwan EU327506 strain. The five ORFV
strains and ORF/09/ Korea strain had a 99.2∼99.5% and
98.4∼99.2% similarity at the nucleotide and predicted
amino acid level, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis
based on the partial VIR gene revealed that the five ORFV
strains were most closely related to the ORF/09/Korea
strain identified in 2009 (Fig. 1B). The five ORFV strains
and ORF/09/Korea strain showed a 99.0∼99.2% and
98.7% similarity at the nucleotide and amino acid level,
respectively.
　ORFV is a highly contagious transboundary pathogen. If
the virus is introduced into disease-free areas, it infects
small ruminants and spreads easily [1]. ORFV infection

among the Korean black goat population was not reported
until dairy goats were brought into Korea. Dairy goats were
initially imported from abroad during the 1990s to produce
liquid and powdered milk. The dairy goat population in
Korea has increased over the past several years. Several
causes for ORFV outbreaks in Korean black goats exist,
and a phylogenetic analysis may indicate the hypothetical
origin of the viral strains involved.
　B2L and VIR gene sequences have been widely used for
molecular epidemiological studies of parapoxviruses.
These are epidemiologically relevant sequences and a
significant quantity of sequence data has been deposited in
GenBank [1-4,9,10]. In the present study, the Korean
ORFV strains were most closely related to the
ORF/09/Korea strain from dairy goats according to the
phylogenetic analysis based on the B2L and VIR genes.
This result indicates that ORFVs from dairy goats might
have been introduced into the Korean black goat
population. Based on a molecular analysis alone, it is
difficult to determine the precise route by which the ORFV
from dairy goats was transmitted to Korean black goats.
However, data from the current study suggest that
introduction of ORFV into the Korean black goat
population might have occurred through dairy goats
imported for meat production or improvement of stock
genetics.
　The vaccine using orf virus isolated from goat may
potentially provide better protection for goats than for
sheep [11]. We isolated one ORFV as a vaccine candidate
from a large-scale outbreak of ORFV infection in Korean
goats. A vaccine will be developed in a future study.
Additional epidemiological data concerning the
distribution of ORFVs among dairy and Korean black
goats in Korea will also contribute to the prevention of
further ORFV outbreaks.
