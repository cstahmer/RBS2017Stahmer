Abstract
A duplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was improved for simultaneous
detection of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus and pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza virus, which is suitable
for early diagnosis of influenza-like patients and for epidemiological surveillance. The sensitivity of this duplex real-time
RT-PCR assay was 0.02 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) for H5N1 and 0.2 TCID50 for the pandemic H1N1, which
was the same as that of each single-target RT-PCR for pandemic H1N1 and even more sensitive for H5N1 with the same
primers and probes. No cross reactivity of detecting other subtype influenza viruses or respiratory tract viruses was
observed. Two hundred and thirty-six clinical specimens were tested by comparing with single real-time RT-PCR and
result from the duplex assay was 100% consistent with the results of single real-time RT-PCR and sequence analysis.
Findings
In March and April 2009, a novel swine-origin pandemic
H1N1 influenza virus appeared and spread worldwide.
The pandemic of H1N1 2009 influenza virus poses a public health threat. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 30 April 2010, worldwide at least
17919 death cases have been reported [1]. Compared
with influenza A H1N1 virus, the highly pathogenic avian
influenza virus H5N1 has a much higher mortality rate:
H5N1 has a mortality rate of more than 50% while novel
pandemic H1N1 has only about 1% [2]. Nevertheless,
pandemic H1N1 and highly pathogenic H5N1 manifest
similar clinical symptoms at the early stage of infection
[3]. Early detection of these two pathogens is an essential
prerequisite for effective control and prevention of the
pandemic.
Real-time RT-PCR/PCR is a powerful method for the
sensitive and specific detection of virus-derived nucleic
acids in clinical samples [4]. It is time-saving and more
specific compared with endpoint PCR. Therefore, realtime RT-PCR assay has been widely used and recom* Correspondence: yangyinhui@hotmail.com

mended by WHO for many rapid viral pathogen detection. Moreover, multiplex assays allow to measure several
fluorophores in one well, which can simultaneously
detect different target sequences [5]. Since the outbreak
of pandemic H1N1 influenza, many real-time RT-PCR
assays have been developed for detecting of the novel
H1N1 [6-13]. Some multiplex real-time RT-PCR assays
for simultaneous typing (A/B) and subtyping of H1, H2,
H3, H5, H7 and H9 of influenza A viruses have also been
reported [14-17]. However, no studies were reported for
subtyping of the novel pandemic H1N1 and H5N1 simultaneously.
In this study, a duplex TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay
was improved by adjusting the concentrations of primers
and probes in the WHO protocols. The assay could
simultaneously detect H5N1 avian influenza virus and
pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, which could be used for
early diagnosis of influenza-like patients and for epidemiological surveillance.
The primers and probes for the novel pandemic H1N1
and the influenza H5N1 were derived from the protocols
recommended by WHO [18,19]. The sequence of primers
for H5N1 were H5-sense: 5'-GGA ACT TAC CAA ATA
CTG TCA ATT TAT TCA-3', H5-antisense: 5'-CCA TAA
AGA TAG ACC AGC TAC CAT GA-3' and H5-probe: 5'-

HEX-TTG CCA GTG CTA GGG AAC TCG CCA CBHQ1-3' which was labeled with the reporter
hexachloro-6-carboxyfluorescein (HEX) at the 5' end and
a black hole quencher (BHQ1) at the 3' end [19]. The
sequence of primers and probe for pandemic H1N1 were
H1-sense: 5'-GTG CTA TAA ACA CCA GCC TYC CA3', H1-antisense: 5'-CGG GAT ATT CCT TAA TCC TGT
RGC-3', H1-probe: 5'-FAM-CAG AAT ATA CAT* CCR
GTC ACA ATT GGA RAA-3' which was labeled with the
reporter 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) at the 5' end and
a black hole quencher (BHQ1) at the a modified T residue
[18]. All primers and probes were synthesized by Dalian
Takara Company.
RNA was extracted from the supernatants of cultured
viruses or from clinical specimens by RNeasy Mini kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacture's instruction. Virus RNA extractions were conducted
in Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) facilities.
The duplex real-time RT-PCR amplification was carried out in a 20 μL volume reaction with the Quantitect
Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with the
LightCycler 2.0 system (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).
Different concentrations of the primers and probes for
both H5N1 and H1N1 were combined and adjusted to
improve the sensitivity of the assay [20]. The concentrations of primers and probe for H5 gene in the duplex system was optimized by using a serial of 10-fold diluted
H5N1 RNAs as templates. The sensitivity of the duplex
assays was evaluated at the concentration of H5 primers
as 0.4 μM, 0.8 μM, 1.6 μM and 3.2 μM. The results
showed that the sensitivity of the duplex assays dramatically increased with the concentration of H5 primers. The
duplex assay had the best detecting result at the H5
primer concentration of 1.6 μM. The concentration of
probes for H5 gene was also optimized by examining the
concentration at 0.1 μM, 0.2 μM, 0.4 μM and 0.8 μM, and
any significant different results at different concentrations was not observed. Therefore, 0.1 μM was selected as
the final concentration of H5 probe in the duplex realtime RT-PCR system. Similar to the duplex assay for H5
gene, the concentrations of primers and probe for H1 also
were optimized by using RNA from 2, 0.2, 0.02 and 0.002
TCID50 H1N1 as templates. The concentration of H1
primers was optimized from 0.1 μM, 0.2 μM, 0.4 μM, 0.8
μM and 1.6 μM, while the concentration of H1 probe was
optimized at 0.1 μM, 0.2 μM, 0.4 μM and 0.8 μM. Thus,
0.4 μM of primers and 0.2 μM of probe were selected as
the optimal concentration for H1 gene. The reactions
were incubated at 50°C for 30 min, followed by 95°C for
10 min, 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, and 52°C for 1 min. Fluorescence was recorded at 52°C.
The final optimized reaction mixture consisted of 10 μL
of 2× reaction buffer, 0.2 μL reverse transcription
enzyme, 1.6 μM of each H5N1 primer, 400 nM of each

novel H1N1 primer, 100 nM of H5N1 probe, 200 nM of
pandemic H1N1 probe and 2 μL RNA templates. The
protocol of real-time RT-PCR for influenza A (H1N1)
recommended by WHO used a concentration of 1000 nM
each of novel SW H1 primers and 250 nM of SW H1
probe [18]. The WHO real-time RT-PCR protocol for
H5N1 used a concentration of 800 nM each of H5 primers and 200 nM of H5 probe [19].
The sensitivity of the single and duplex real-time RTPCR for novel H1N1 and H5N1 virus was evaluated by
10-fold diluted virus RNA, respectively. The pandemic
H1N1 influenza virus strain A/Beijing/501/2009(H1N1)
(GenBank: GQ223408-GQ223415) and avian influenza
virus H5N1 strain A/Beijing/01/2003 (GenBank:
EF587274-EF587281) were cultured on MDCK cells and
tested by the assay. The analysis of threshold cycles (Ct)
signals as a function of log10 TCID50 titers of tested
viruses showed a nearly linear decrease of Ct value with
increased virus titer. The sensitivity of the single realtime RT-PCR assay was 0.2 TCID50 for both novel pandemic H1N1 and H5N1 virus. The detection threshold of
the duplex real-time RT-PCR assay was 0.2 TCID50 for
the pandemic H1N1 and 0.02 TCID50 for H5N1 virus.
Compared with single real-time RT-PCR assay, the
duplex real-time RT-PCR assay had the same sensitivity
for pandemic H1N1 virus, and about 10-fold more sensitive for H5N1 virus (0.02 TCID50) (Figure 1). This was
likely because the procedure of the duplex assay for H5N1
was optimized for Roche LightCycler 2.0 system, while
the single real-time RT-PCR assay recommended by
WHO was optimized for ABI instruments [18].
The specificity of the duplex real time RT-PCR assay
was validated by using human genomes and a panel of
respiratory tract viruses including human seasonal H3N2
influenza viruses, seasonal H1N1 virus, human respiratory syncytial virus A and B, human coronavirus 229E,
human coronavirus OC43, influenza B virus, human
parainfluenza virus and human adenovirus. All samples
were tested negative (data not shown).
A total of 236 clinical throat swab specimens from suspected cases of novel pandemic H1N1 patients were collected. The samples were first detected by WHO realtime RT-PCR protocol for influenza A (H1N1). As the
WHO protocol also included a set of primers for universal detection of type A influenza viruses, thus, only the
182 Influenza A positive samples confirmed by WHO
protocol were further tested by the duplex system for
comparison with the results of WHO protocol. Among
the 182 influenza type A positive specimens, 124 specimens were positive for the pandemic H1N1 and none for
the H5N1 tested by the duplex system. Duplex real-time
RT-PCR assays showed 100% coincident results with the
single real-time assays. Sequence analysis was also con-

humans and to cause severe infection has raised serious
concerns regarding the control measures of this virus.
The duplex real-time RT-PCR assay for pandemic H1N1
and high pathogenic H5N1 would play an important role
for control and prevention of pandemic caused by these
viruses.

Figure 1 Sensitivity and dynamic range of the duplex real-time
RT-PCR assay for detection of H5N1 and pandemic H1N1 viral
RNA. Serial 10-fold dilutions of viral RNA standard (from 2 × 10-2 to 2 ×
104 TCID50) were plotted against the threshold cycle (Ct). A Minimum
of 0.2 TCID50 H1N1 viruses or 0.02 TCID50 H5N1 viruses per reaction
could be detected. The coefficient of determination (R2) and the equation of the regression curve (y) calculated.

ducted with 20 samples selected randomly from the novel
H1N1 positive specimens.
Since few clinical specimens was available currently in
China, a mock clinical H5N1 specimen was extracted
from the spleen of BALB/C mice infected with high
pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus to validate the specificity of high pathogenic H5N1 virus. The duplex real-time
RT-PCR assay showed strong positive result, which was
confirmed by single real-time PCR and subsequent
sequencing analyses. This demonstrated that the duplex
real-time RT-PCR assay was a substitute method for the
current single real-time RT-PCR method.
So far, the number of confirmed severe novel H1N1
cases has reached about seven hundred thousand in
China and increased quickly. The lessons from 1918 and
1957 influenza suggested that the pandemic might return
in a much more lethal form in the second wave [21].
Recently, the increasing geographic distribution of high
pathogenic H5N1 as well as its ability to transfer to
