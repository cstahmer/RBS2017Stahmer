ABSTRACT
The NCBI Taxonomy database (http://www.ncbi
.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) is the standard nomenclature and classification repository for the
International Nucleotide Sequence Database
Collaboration (INSDC), comprising the GenBank,
ENA (EMBL) and DDBJ databases. It includes
organism names and taxonomic lineages for each
of the sequences represented in the INSDC’s nucleotide and protein sequence databases. The
taxonomy database is manually curated by a small
group of scientists at the NCBI who use the current
taxonomic literature to maintain a phylogenetic
taxonomy for the source organisms represented in
the sequence databases. The taxonomy database is
a central organizing hub for many of the resources
at the NCBI, and provides a means for clustering
elements within other domains of NCBI web site,
for internal linking between domains of the Entrez
system and for linking out to taxon-specific external
resources on the web. Our primary purpose is to
index the domain of sequences as conveniently as
possible for our user community.
A BRIEF HISTORY
The NCBI Taxonomy project began in 1991, when we
designed the ﬁrst version of the Entrez information retrieval system. At that time, each of the partners of what
was to become the International Nucleotide Sequence
Database Collaboration (INSDC)—GenBank, EMBL
and the DDBJ—maintained the taxonomic nomenclature
and classiﬁcation in their own sequence entries independently. The classiﬁcations used by the three partners were
clearly derived from a common source, but had drifted
apart over the years. Sequence entries were regularly
exchanged within the collaboration, but the source
organism nomenclature and taxonomic classiﬁcations
were inconsistent and were updated irregularly. Protein
sequences were maintained separately from the nucleotide
sequences, in two different databases—Swiss-Prot (1) and

PIR (2). Each of these databases maintained their own
taxonomies, each very different from the other and from
the more closely related taxonomies in use by the INSDC
partners.
Entrez (3) was the ﬁrst system to link nucleotide sequences and protein sequences (from all of these
sources) together with relevant abstracts from the scientific literature in a single uniﬁed resource. It was obviously
important to provide a single taxonomic classiﬁcation to
index the entire set of entries in Entrez. The ﬁrst step was
to shufﬂe together the taxonomies from each of the
contributing databases, each of which covered a
somewhat different set of species with often very different
internal classiﬁcations. The end result of this process was a
hideous abomination, but it did provide a single classiﬁcation that spanned all of the entries in Entrez, which we
set out to improve. At this point we hosted series of
taxonomy workshops to provide advice and direction for
the project. David Hillis, John Taylor and Gary Olsen, in
particular, put in a signiﬁcant amount of time and effort in
the initial cleanup of our merged classiﬁcation.
The next step forward was the 1997 agreement by the
INSDC members to resolve taxonomic issues of nomenclature and classiﬁcation prior to the release of new
sequence data. Sequences submitted to GenBank are
screened for organism names that are new to the
taxonomy database, and result in a taxonomy consult
sent to the taxonomy group. Prior to this agreement, we
would not see the organism names in entries from the
collaborating databases until they had been released to
the public—issues involving synonymies, misspellings
and alternate classiﬁcations had to be resolved and corrected after the fact. To improve this situation, the INSDC
partners agreed to send taxonomy consults to the NCBI
when they ﬁrst processed their entries, just as the
GenBank indexing group does. As a consequence, the
NCBI agreed that our public taxonomy pages would
only show taxa that are linked to public sequence entries.

THE NCBI TAXONOMY DATABASE
The NCBI Taxonomy database was developed to ﬁll a
practical and very speciﬁc need—to provide nomenclature

and classiﬁcation for the source organisms in the sequence
databases. In this respect, it differs from most existing
taxonomy databases—we do not have the luxury of
focusing on a particular area of expertise; we have to
deal with names of all sorts that walk in the door on a
daily basis with new sequence submissions. By its very
nature, the taxonomy database is closely tied to the
sequence databases—updates to the nomenclature and
taxonomy are automatically reﬂected in the corresponding
sequence entries. We try to maintain a phylogenetic
taxonomy—one in which the structure of the classiﬁcation
corresponds with the evolutionary history of the tree of
life. A phylogenetic classiﬁcation aims to include only
monophyletic groups—groups in which all of the
members are more closely related to each other than any
of them are to anything outside of the group. The traditional Reptilia, for example, is not a monophyletic group,
since the crocodiles are more closely related to the birds
than they are to the lizards and turtles. At the same time,
the NCBI taxonomy is not generated automatically from
the sequence data—rather, we try to reﬂect the current
consensus in the systematic literature.
There are several large taxonomy database projects that
seek to aggregate names from other sources into more or
less comprehensive collections—the Catalog of Life, the
Encyclopedia of Life, NameBank and WikiSpecies, for
example. These are useful resources for the taxonomy
group when we research the names that we add to our
database, and we maintain reciprocal links with many of
them. Even more useful are the curated specialty databases that are devoted to a particular group—IPNI for
the plants, Index Fungorum and MycoBank for the
fungi, Algaebase for the algae, AmphibiaWeb and
Amphibian Species of the World for the amphibians, the
Catalog of Fishes and FishBase for the ﬁsh, Bergey’s
Manual for the prokaryotes and so on. More than 150
outside groups are registered to maintain LinkOut
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/linkout/) links in
the NCBI Taxonomy database. But in every case, the
ultimate authoritative source for the nomenclature and
classiﬁcation is the primary taxonomic literature itself.
The NCBI Taxonomy database serves as an important
entry point into the Entrez system for users who want to
ﬁnd all available information about a particular taxon,
from the species level (and below) on up to genus,
family, order and higher (or unranked) levels of the hierarchy. Many of the domains of Entrez (sequence, structure, genes, genomes, literature, etc.) are indexed by
taxonomy in the [organism] search ﬁeld, and these
indices support reciprocal links between the taxonomy
and the other domains of Entrez that are surfaced in the
taxonomy browser.
HOW MANY SPECIES?
Since its inception, the NCBI Taxonomy database has
paralleled the growth of the sequence databases themselves. How many species are represented in the
database? This requires a little background into the structure of the database. By INSDC collaborative agreement,

D137

each entry in the sequence database must map into the
taxonomy at or below the species level (an exception is
made for patent entries). Each entry in the taxonomy
database includes a primary name (the ‘scientiﬁc name’)
and any number of secondary names, of several different
name types. The primary name may either be a formal
name (with standing in the relevant code of nomenclature)
or an informal name (which represent putative species that
have not yet been described in the literature, or specimens
that have not been identiﬁed to a particular species).
Environmental sample sequences constitute a special
subset of informal names—these are sequences that have
been recovered directly from the environment, with no
direct knowledge of the source organism (apart from the
sequence itself). The public taxonomy database currently
(as of 26 September 2011) includes 234 991 species with
formal names and another 405 546 ‘species’ with informal
names (33 406 of which represent environmental samples).
Counts of ‘species’ with informal names must be interpreted carefully, since many of these represent individual
strains or specimens, not real putative species.
The taxonomy statistics page gives a summary of counts
in the taxonomy database that can be customized in
several ways—the default settings display counts only
for species with formal names, but this page can be
conﬁgured in many different ways (Figure 1)
There are three main codes of nomenclature—one for
the animals (the ICZN) (4), one for plants, algae and fungi
(the ICN, formerly the ICBN) (5,6) and one for the prokaryotes (the ICNB) (7,8). Each of these codes consists of
a set of rules for publishing new taxonomic names in the
scientiﬁc literature. There is also the ICTV for the viruses,
which is not so much a code of nomenclature as an
approved list of valid species names and classiﬁcations,
maintained by a large set of committees, each responsible
for a particular group of viruses (9). Formal names (except
viruses) have ‘authorities’. The authority for a name is a
reference to the taxonomic publication where the name
was ﬁrst described—much like a structured literature
reference, e.g. Homo sapiens Linnaeus, 1758 and
Caenorhabditis elegans (Maupas, 1900). These can take
many complicated forms, but most are quite simple—the
parenthesis in the second case indicate that this species
was originally described under a different name, in this
case Rhabditis elegans Maupas, 1900, and was transferred
to the genus Caenorhabditis by a later author.
The taxonomy database currently includes 11 110 prokaryotic species with formal scientiﬁc names (as of 26
September 2011). This includes virtually all of the
formally described species of prokaryotes (Bacteria and
Archaea)—most are represented by at least a 16S rRNA
sequence, as is every description of a new bacterial species.
There are several wrinkles. If you sample the 16S rRNA
sequences found in almost any environment, the vast
majority of them do not closely resemble any of the
formally described species of bacteria that are commonly
studied in the laboratory. Furthermore, the bacterial code
of nomenclature requires that the description of each new
species include the designation of a ‘type strain’, a pure
culture that must be deposited in at least two different
culture collections. This means that bacteria that can not

(or have not) been cultured cannot be formally described
in the literature. ‘Candidatus’ nomenclature is an attempt
to address this problem—names like Candidatus
Liberibacter africanus are semi-formal species that can
be cited in the literature, but have not been cultured in
the laboratory. As of 26 September 2011, there were only
287 Candidatus species listed in the taxonomy database.
The vast majority of prokaryotic diversity lies outside of
the currently described taxa, and is likely to number in
millions of species.
The taxonomy database currently includes 221 263 eukaryotic species with formal scientiﬁc names (as of 26
September 2011). Estimates of the number of eukaryotic
species that have already been described in the literature
vary widely, typically between 1.25 and 2 million. Given
this uncertainty, the sequence databases currently contain

at least a snippet of sequence from 10% to 20% of the
described species of life on earth. Estimates of the total
number of species on earth vary even more widely, typically 10 million or more (10).
The taxonomy database also includes 95 extinct species
that are represented in the sequence databases, ranging in
time from the woolly mammoth to Tyrannosaurus rex. In
this context, it is important to note that GenBank and the
taxonomy group do not (and cannot) attempt to verify the
taxonomic identiﬁcation that is provided by the submitter,
unless the sequence itself points to an egregious misidentiﬁcation. We rejected an earlier submission of dinosaur
DNA that proved to be 99% identical to E. coli sequence,
but the collagen protein fragment sequences submitted
as coming from T. rex are not inconsistent with this
identiﬁcation.

MORE ABOUT NAMES
Names can be duplicated in many ways. For example,
‘black darter’ is the common name for both a ﬁsh
(Sympetrum danae) and a dragonﬂy (Etheostoma duryi),
while geranium is the common name for a species of
plant (Pelargonium x hortorum) and the scientiﬁc name
for a different genus of plants (Geranium). Names that
actually mean the same thing can appear in multiple
places in the classiﬁcation. As mentioned above, we list
the birds (within the Dinosauria) as sister group to the
crocodilians (their closest living relatives). For retrieval
purposes, we list the common name ‘reptiles’ and the
formal name ‘Reptilia’ at three different nodes in our
taxonomy (to pick up the turtles, the crocodiles and the
lizards and snakes).
Duplicated scientiﬁc names are of particular interest to
us. As mentioned above, formal names are regulated by
codes of nomenclature. Each of the codes of nomenclature
is different—they regulate different classes of names under
different sets of rules. There is no real attempt to ensure
that names are not duplicated between the domains of the
codes of nomenclature—and in some cases, even within
them. For example, the zoological code of nomenclature
regulates names at the species, genus and family levels, but
it does not require that names be unique between these
sets. As a consequence, it is perfectly legal to ﬁnd the
damselﬂy genus Lestoidea in a superfamily of the same
name. The zoological code does not regulate names
above the family level, so we list the superclass
Gnathostomata (the jawed vertebrates) and the superorder Gnathostomata (the sand dollars). Duplications
between the codes are a bigger problem—we have come
across hundreds of generic names that are valid under
more than one code. Bacillus, for example, is a genus of
bacteria and a genus of stick insects. Leptonema is a genus
of plants, of bacteria, and of insects—and a genus of fossil
fungi (fossils have a separate nomenclature of their own).
The real problem (for the sequence database application)
lies at the species level. With a large number of duplicated
genus names, it is to be expected that the commonly used
species epithets (americana, robusta, elegans, etc.) will
result in duplicated names at the species level. We have
come across six examples of duplicated binomials that are
represented in the sequence databases (Table 1). In these
cases, we use the full binomial name with the authority to
disambiguate the entries.

D139

We use informal names for entries that are not identiﬁed
to the species level with formal names. We try to avoid
names like ‘Bacillus sp.’, and even names like ‘Bacillus sp.
1’ and ‘Bacillus sp. A’, which can easily be used by different researchers to denote different species. We do not
distinguish between informal names that represent
putative undescribed species (like Danio sp. ‘Hikari’ and
Etheostoma cf. bellator A TJN-2011) and names that represent individual specimens which have not been assigned
to a species (like Maytenus aff. obtusifolia Lombardi 7213
and Corallium sp. USNM 1075800).
Table 2 shows the various name types that are allowed
in the taxonomy database.
The ‘scientiﬁc name’ is the primary name for the node,
and may either be a formal or an informal name.
Synonyms may also be formal or informal names. The
‘equivalent name’ name type was added to tighten up
our usage of synonyms—informal synonyms of formal
scientiﬁc names should appear here, although this usage
is not enforced. Acronyms are primarily used for the
viruses, and common names for the higher eukaryotes.
Misspellings are for incorrect forms of names that have
previously appeared in sequence entries, as well as for
misspellings that are found in the literature. These can
be used in taxonomy lookups, but they do not appear
on our web displays. Misnomers are for incorrect forms
of names that aren’t quite misspellings—and for
misspellings that we want to appear on our web
displays. Other name types (includes and in-part) are for
names which are useful as retrieval terms but which do not
correspond with unique taxa in our classiﬁcation (e.g.
Reptilia).
The anamorph and teleomorph name types are specifically for use in the Fungi. Current practice allows fungal
species to have two completely different scientiﬁc names
depending on whether they are in the asexual, haploid
(anamorph) or sexual, diploid (teleomorph) phase of
their growth cycle. The most recent meeting of the botanical nomenclature section has addressed this confusing
situation, and the new botanical code of nomenclature
will mandate ‘one fungus, one name’. The current multiplicity of names should be resolved over the coming
decades.
The ‘unpublished name’ is a particularly important new
name type. It is becoming increasingly common to include
a little bit of DNA sequence when describing a new species

in the literature—the 16S rRNA sequence in prokaryotes,
the barcode locus (COI for the animals, rbcL and matK
for the plants, ITS for the fungi) and/or one of the other
standard phylogenetic loci. This means that authors are
coming to GenBank prior to publication to get accession
numbers for sequences with ‘manuscript names’—
proposed new species names that have not yet appeared
in print. Our experience with the bacteria proved that the
proposed new name would very often be changed during
the editorial review process before the description of the
new species was published, but that submitters would
rarely get back in touch with us to update the name in
their sequence entries. Furthermore, it can be very dangerous to expose these unpublished names—if they make
their way into a taxonomic publication before the corresponding description is published they become nomen
nudum (literally ‘naked name’) and are subsequently
invalid. For these reasons we added the ‘unpublished
name’ name type. These nodes are indexed with an
informal name—our default formula uses the submitters’
initials and year of submission (rather like an informal
authority for an informal name). For example,
FN677936–FN677950 were originally submitted with
the unpublished name Parapercis lutevittatus. These were
indexed and released with the informal name Parapercis
sp. TYC-2010. This species was eventually published as
Parapercis lutevittata (11), and the name was updated in
the taxonomy. At no point did the name Parapercis
lutevittatus appear on our public web pages, although it
could always be used as a successful search term (ﬁrst as
an unpublished name, and now as a misspelling).
The ‘GenBank’ name types are the way that we identify
the ‘ﬁrst among equals’ for use in display purposes. For
common names and acronyms (which are informal name
types), the ‘GenBank’ name type identiﬁes the name that
should appear in the GenBank ﬂatﬁle. The ‘GenBank’
formal names (synonym and anamorph) are used in a
much more limited manner—these are only assigned
when two different names are in common use for the
same species. For example, the valid taxonomic name

display summarizes the taxonomic distribution of plant sequences

for the torafugu pufferﬁsh is Takifugu rubripes, but the
junior synonym Fugu rubripes is common in much of the
molecular biology literature (12). The ‘GenBank
synonym’ name type ensures that both names will
appear prominently in all the GenBank ﬂatﬁles from this
species. We would do the same thing if a taxonomic
revision forces a name change from Drosophila
melanogaster to Sophophora melanogaster (13).
The ‘blast names’ are a special subset of common names
for large, well-known taxa like the red algae, the mammals
or the beetles. We have assigned 222 ‘blast names’ in the
taxonomy. These are used for display purposes (in
BLAST, in Taxonomy Entrez etc.) when a species name
might not be generally recognizable. For example, many
users will not recognize Cibotium barometz. Even when a
common name is listed (Scythian lamb, in this case) it may
not be informative—but the ‘blast name’ (ferns) is very
helpful. Blast names are also used in the interactive
taxonomy portlet found in many Entrez domains, since
they provide an abbreviated, vernacular view of the classiﬁcation (Figure 2).

ACCESS TO THE TAXONOMY DATABASE
The NCBI taxonomy is stored in an SQL Server relational
database, called TAXON. The NCBI taxonomy group

Nucleic Acids Research, 2012, Vol. 40, Database issue

maintains the database with taxedit, a customized
software tool. The database is taxon-centric; each node
represents a taxonomic element (a taxon) and is identiﬁed
with a numerical unique identiﬁer (the taxid). Taxids are
stable and persistent—they may be deleted (when taxa are
removed from the database) and they may be merged
(when taxa are synonymized), but they will never be
reused to identify a different taxon. Names are associated
with nodes, and each taxid is linked to its parent taxid.
The root node (taxid 1) links to itself.
Public access to the taxonomy database is provided in
three different ways—the Taxonomy Browser (which is
updated in real time as we edit the database), the
Taxonomy domain of Entrez (which is updated daily)
and the taxonomy ftp site (which is updated hourly).
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy

Taxonomy was the ﬁrst database to be added to the
Entrez system after the initial triad of Nucleotide,
Protein and PubMed. As with other Entrez databases,
Taxonomy Entrez supports Boolean queries, a History
function and an array of search ﬁelds. Some of the
search ﬁelds are common across all Entrez databases—
Date (the date the object ﬁrst appeared in Entrez), Filter
(links to internal and external databases) and Properties
(many useful search terms)—others are speciﬁc to
Taxonomy (e.g. Rank). Taxonomy was the ﬁrst Entrez
database to have an internal hierarchical structure.
Taxonomy search ﬁelds and search history can be
browsed on the Advanced Search page. Because Entrez
deals with unordered sets of objects in a given domain,
we introduced two new ﬁelds to represent the hierarchy—
the Lineage ﬁeld indexes all of the taxa in the hierarchy
above a given node in the taxonomy, and Subtree indexes
all of the taxa below it. Several useful queries are shown in
Table 3.
All of the tools developed for Entrez are available for
use with Taxonomy Entrez. Taxonomy Entrez search
results can be downloaded in several formats using the
‘Send to File’. The E-utilities (14) facility can be used to
query and retrieve entries from Taxonomy in Perl scripts.

Taxonomy Entrez queries can be saved in MyNCBI (15),
and the user can register to receive periodic email updates
(What’s New) whenever anything new in Entrez satisﬁes
the query. For example, one can register the query
‘speciﬁed [property]’, and ask to receive a weekly (or
monthly, or daily) email with the list of species that
have appeared in the sequence databases for the ﬁrst
time in the last week.
Taxonomy Entrez provides some powerful tools for
searching the taxonomy, but it is not a natural way to
explore a hierarchical data set. The Taxonomy Browser
provides this facility. The browser supports two different
kinds of web pages—hierarchy pages, which present the
familiar indented view of the taxonomic classiﬁcation, and
taxon-speciﬁc pages, which summarize all of the information that we associate with a particular taxonomic entry in
the database. By default, the hierarchy displays three
levels in the classiﬁcation, but this can be changed
(asking for zero levels displays the taxon-speciﬁc page).
The hierarchy pages can also be customized to display
hotlinked counts of entries in other Entrez databases
(Figure 3).
The taxon-speciﬁc pages display several different kinds
of information, starting with all of the names associated
with the entry in the taxonomy database (except for
misspellings and unpublished names, as discussed
above). The lineage line displays toggles between the full
and abbreviated taxonomic classiﬁcation for the entry (the
abbreviated lineage appears in the GenBank sequence
entries). The taxonomy group may also manually curate
comments, and hotlinks to literature references either in
PubMed or at arbitrary URL addresses in the Web. The
‘Entrez records’ table shows links to other Entrez databases, in two columns—‘Subtree links’ and ‘Direct links’
(also called ‘exploded’ and ‘unexploded’ links). The direct
(unexploded) links retrieve entries that map directly to this
taxon; the subtree (exploded) links retrieve all of the
entries that map into the taxonomy at or below this
taxon. Many databases (Nucleotide, Protein, Structure,
etc.) typically map into the taxonomy at or below the
sequence level, and entries that break that rule are either
annotation errors or exceptions (e.g. the 47 entries with /
organism=‘Hominidae’ all patent sequences). The default
Entrez links from Taxonomy to these Entrez databases
follow the exploded links—from Mammalia in
taxonomy, we want to retrieve all of the mammalian sequences in GenBank (not just the ones with /
organism=‘Mammalia’). The literature domains are different—following the direct links to PubMed Central will
ﬁnd all of the articles that mention the ‘Mammalia’. These
are likely to be the articles of interest, and not every paper
that uses Chinese hamster cell lines or inbred mouse
strains. Links to the Entrez Popset domain (the database
of population studies and phylogenetic sets) are another
special case—the direct links will retrieve every phylogenetic set that spans the taxon of interest, while the subtree
links will include all of the sets that are completely contained within the taxon.
LinkOut links are also prominently displayed on the
browser pages. LinkOut is a facility supported by the
NCBI that allow outside users to maintain detailed sets

of hotlinks from entries in Entrez back to speciﬁc web
pages on their own sites. It was ﬁrst developed to allow
publishers to put links on PubMed abstracts back to the
full-text articles on their own sites, but it has since been
extended to serve all of the domains of Entrez. LinkOut
users are given an ftp site at the NCBI where they can
upload ﬁles that describe how to build the links they
would like to support. For example, the Encyclopedia of
Life supports links back to species pages at eol.org, and
Rod Page supports the links to WikiSpecies.
It is easy to build URLs that link to speciﬁc pages in the
Taxonomy browser (see Linking to Taxonomy, on the
Taxonomy home page) and to build URLs that evaluate
speciﬁc queries in Taxonomy Entrez (see Linking to
Records in the Entrez System, in Entrez Help on the
NCBI Bookshelf).
The Taxonomy browser also supports several search
capabilities that are not available in the generic Entrez
search—in particular, the ‘wild card’ search mode
uncovers two entries that match ‘E* coli’, and 79 entries
that match ‘C* elegans’. There is only a very limited
wild-card search capability within Entrez itself.

We provide two other useful tools relevant to the
taxonomy database—the name/id status page and the
common tree viewer. Upload a list of names (or a list of
taxids) into the status page to see a report of their current
status in the NCBI taxonomy database. Save copies of the
report and track differences to follow changes in the classiﬁcation and nomenclature of a set of taxa of particular
interest. A command-line version of this function
(taxident) is available in the NCBI C++ toolkit. Upload
a list of names (or a list of taxids) into the common tree
viewer to see the subset of the NCBI taxonomy that spans
that set of nodes. The common tree view is also one of the
display formats once you have selected a set of nodes in
Taxonomy Entrez. The tree can be saved in several
standard formats—text ﬁle, phylip tree (Newick format)
and taxid list.
The taxonomy ftp site includes table dumps from the
TAXON database that are sufﬁcient to recreate the
taxonomy. There is a terse README, but the two
crucial ﬁles are nodes.dmp (which maps taxids to their
parent taxids) and names.dmp (which maps names to
taxids). delnodes.dmp lists nodes that have been deleted

from the database, as well as nodes that were once public
but are no longer linked to any public sequence entries.
merged.dmp maps secondary taxids onto primary taxids
for taxa that have been synonymized in the database.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
There are several initiatives underway, notably the
Barcodes of Life (16) initiative, that are actively focused
on sequencing reference specimens from every eukaryotic
species of life on the planet. These efforts should lead to a
rapid expansion of the NCBI taxonomy database over the
coming years.
