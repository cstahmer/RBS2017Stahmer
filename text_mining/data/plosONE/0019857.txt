Open Access Peer-reviewed Research Article  * E-mail: arodgers@georgeinstitute.org ¶For a list of members please see the Acknowledgments. There has been widespread interest in the potential of combination
                        cardiovascular medications containing aspirin and agents to lower blood
                        pressure and cholesterol (‘polypills’) to reduce cardiovascular
                        disease. However, no reliable placebo-controlled data are available on both
                        efficacy and tolerability. We conducted a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of a
                        polypill (containing aspirin 75 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, hydrochlorothiazide
                        12.5 mg and simvastatin 20 mg) in 378 individuals without an indication for
                        any component of the polypill, but who had an estimated 5-year
                        cardiovascular disease risk over 7.5%. The primary outcomes were
                        systolic blood pressure (SBP), LDL-cholesterol and tolerability (proportion
                        discontinued randomised therapy) at 12 weeks follow-up. At baseline, mean BP was 134/81 mmHg and mean LDL-cholesterol was 3.7 mmol/L.
                        Over 12 weeks, polypill treatment reduced SBP by 9.9 (95% CI: 7.7 to
                        12.1) mmHg and LDL-cholesterol by 0.8 (95% CI 0.6 to 0.9) mmol/L. The
                        discontinuation rates in the polypill group compared to placebo were
                        23% vs 18% (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.00,
                        p = 0.2). There was an excess of side effects known to
                        the component medicines (58% vs 42%,
                        p = 0.001), which was mostly apparent within a few
                        weeks, and usually did not warrant cessation of trial treatment. This polypill achieved sizeable reductions in SBP and LDL-cholesterol but
                        caused side effects in about 1 in 6 people. The halving in predicted
                        cardiovascular risk is moderately lower than previous estimates and the side
                        effect rate is moderately higher. Nonetheless, substantial net benefits
                        would be expected among patients at high risk. Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12607000099426 Citation: PILL

                    matching placebo were provided free of charge by Dr. Reddy's Laboratories,
                    Hyderabad, India. None of these parties had any role in study design, data
                    collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The
                    corresponding author had full access to all data in the study. The Steering
                    Committee had final responsibility for the decision to submit for
                    publication. Competing interests:  The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. In 2001, the World Health Organisation and The Wellcome Trust convened a meeting of
                experts to discuss evidence-based and affordable interventions for non-communicable
                    diseases.[1] A
                major impetus for the meeting was the potential of fixed-dose combination pills
                containing aspirin, statin and blood pressure lowering agents, noting “the use
                of a single pill could well encourage patients to adhere to treatment as well as
                seriously reduce the cost of the drugs.” A programme of research was outlined,
                including stability and bio-availability testing followed by assessment of
                short-term effects on blood pressure, cholesterol, platelet aggregation, safety and
                side effects, ideally including developing country participants. In 2002, the WHO
                Annual Report outlined the substantial potential public health impact and
                cost-effectiveness of scaling up access to combination treatment.[2] An editorial that
                year also noted that a four component combination pill would be expected to reduce
                cardiovascular risk by about 75% among people with vascular disease.[3] In 2003 the first
                full exposition of the scientific evidence for cardiovascular combination pills was
                published in the medical literature.[4], [5], [6], [7] The ‘polypill’ term was coined and gained
                widespread attention, in large part due to the recommendation to treat everyone aged
                over 55 years in developed countries. The proposal to target treatments based on age
                alone has been highly polarizing. An alternate approach, now recommended by major
                cross-disciplinary guidelines[8], [9], [10], [11] and the European Medicines Agency (EMA),[12] is to target
                treatments principally on the basis of global cardiovascular risk. As noted by the
                    EMA[12]
                “the terms primary/secondary prevention have yielded their place for a more
                comprehensive strategy aimed at treating patients at high risk of cardiovascular
                disease…current therapeutic strategies are aimed at identifying global
                cardiovascular disease risk in an individual and treating all risk factors. Global
                risk intervention, rather than single risk modification is the standard of
                care”. We therefore set out to conduct the trial recommended by the meeting of the WHO and
                The Wellcome Trust, assessing short-term efficacy and side effects, among people at
                raised global cardiovascular risk. The trial aimed to assess the full effects of
                polypill treatment compared to placebo. Such information would be relevant to
                research among people with raised cardiovascular risk (many of whom are not
                currently treated as they do not have ‘hypertension’ or
                ‘dyslipidaemia’) and we planned this initiative as a necessary first
                step before starting a large long-term trial in this population. The trial was also
                planned to inform research and treatment in people with established vascular
                disease, since the risk factor reductions would be generalisable but use of placebo
                is not appropriate in this group. The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as
                supporting information; see Checklist S1 and Protocol
                S1. We conducted a randomised controlled trial in seven countries – Australia
                (n = 21), Brazil (n = 8), India
                (n = 109), Netherlands (n = 102), New
                Zealand (n = 12), United Kingdom (n = 113)
                and United States (n = 13). Approval for the trial was obtained
                from the institutional ethics committee of each centre and all participants provided
                written informed consent. The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand
                Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN 12607000099426). The key eligibility criteria were raised cardiovascular risk together with no
                    indication for or contraindication to treatment with component medicines in the
                    polypill. Individuals were included if they were adults (≥18 years) with a
                    cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk over 5 years of at least 7.5%,
                    determined by the Framingham risk function[13] using data on age,
                    gender, blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, diabetes status and
                    cigarette smoking status (left ventricular hypertrophy was assumed to be absent
                    for the purpose of CVD risk calculation). A value of 7.5% on Framingham
                    function was chosen as half the threshold value above which all modalities are
                    recommended in the first set of guidelines based on absolute risk.[14] While
                    Framingham performs well in modern clinical practice after calibration[15] it is
                    nonetheless imperfect.[16] For example, it does not incorporate some risk
                    factors that have additional predictive value. Therefore, those with an
                    estimated 5-year risk of 5.0– <7.5% from the Framingham function
                    were also eligible if two or more additional risk factors were present: body
                    mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m2; waist circumference >102 cm in men
                    or >88 cm in women; heart rate >80 beats/min; fasting glucose 5.6–
                    <7 mmol/L; triglycerides >1.7 mmol/L; family history of premature coronary
                    heart disease (CHD) or ischaemic stroke in a first degree male relative before
                    the age of 55 years or a first degree female relative before the age of 65
                    years; or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 mL/min. Uniform definitions
                    were used for all centres. To be included, the participants had to have no
                    contraindication to treatment with low-dose aspirin, angiotensin-converting
                    enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, low-dose diuretic or statin; nor any indication or
                    recommendation under local guidance for treatment with any of these medicines.
                    The participating countries varied in their extent of risk factor
                    threshold-based (eg. hypertension treatment) or absolute risk-based treatment
                    practices. Therefore some participants had comparatively high risk factor levels
                    (but moderate absolute risk), while others had comparatively high absolute risk
                    (but moderate risk factor levels). Participants taking other antiplatelet, blood
                    pressure lowering or cholesterol lowering medicines were also excluded, as were
                    patients with diabetes mellitus or GFR ≤30 ml/min/1.73 m2. Eligible participants were randomised to the Red Heart Pill (RHP, a polypill
                    comprising a bilayered tablet containing aspirin 75 mg, lisinopril 10 mg,
                    hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg and simvastatin 20 mg) or an identical placebo, in a
                    1:1 ratio. Participants, research staff and and co-ordinating centre staff were
                    all blinded to the allocation. Study treatment was taken once a day in the
                    evening with food. There was no ‘run-in’ period. Study treatments
                    were allocated using a central computer-based randomisation service at The
                    Clinical Trials Research Unit, University of Auckland, accessible by internet,
                    using a minimisation algorithm including age, sex and centre. Participants were
                    recruited from 17 October 2008 to 22 December 2009. Regulatory delays in
                    importing trial treatment were prolonged and recruitment was 22 participants
                    less than intended, since the study medication expiry date was reached. The use of concomitant open-label therapy was allowed at the discretion of the
                    responsible clinician. Without the need to unblind, additional treatment with
                    open-label therapy was permitted –75 mg aspirin; any beta-blocker, calcium
                    channel blocker, angiotensin receptor blocker or alpha-blocker; 10–20 mg
                    lisinopril and/or 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide or 2.5 mg bendrofluazide;
                    10–20 mg simvastatin – if any of these treatments became indicated
                    during the trial. If there was a need for higher doses of aspirin, ACE
                    inhibitor, diuretic or simvastatin, these were provided as open label treatment
                    and the trial treatment was stopped. Open-label fibrate (with the exception of
                    gemfibrozil) could also be added, without the need to unblind or stop the trial
                    treatment, provided that appropriate monitoring for rhabdomyolysis was
                    instituted. Participants were seen at 2, 6 and 12 weeks after randomisation, with a
                    post-study follow-up appointment 4 weeks after the final 12-week visit. At study
                    visits, information on adherence to and tolerability of study treatments, blood
                    pressure, lipids and occurrence of adverse events was obtained. Blood pressure
                    was recorded as the mean of two measurements made after the patient was rested
                    for at least 5 minutes in the seated position, using a standardised automated
                    sphygmomanometer that had been validated according to the protocol of the
                    Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) or British
                    Hypertension Society, International protocol version. Lipid measurements were
                    undertaken at local laboratories holding ISO 15189 (2003 or later)
                    accreditation. The trial was co-ordinated by The Clinical Trials Research Unit,
                    at The University of Auckland which provided an internet based clinical trial
                    management system. An independent monitor completed bi- monthly site visits to
                    ensure the trial was conducted according to the protocol, good clinical practice
                    guidelines and relevant local regulatory requirements. All participants provided
                    informed consent. The primary study outcomes were change in systolic blood pressure (SBP), change
                    in LDL-cholesterol and tolerability (proportion who withdrew from trial
                    treatment for any reason). Secondary outcomes were treatment adherence (%
                    of prescribed treatment according to pill counts, with participants asked to
                    return all used blisters and unused trial treatment to study visits), diastolic
                    blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol:HDL
                    cholesterol ratio, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, frequency of
                    switching/adding open-label treatment and estimated effects on CVD risk. It was estimated that 400 participants would provide 85% power at
                    2p = 0.05 to detect a 0.25 mmol/l difference in
                    LDL-cholesterol and 80% power to detect a 4 mmHg difference in systolic
                    blood pressure between the intervention and control groups, assuming standard
                    deviations around the change from baseline levels of 0.8 mmol/l and 14 mmHg
                    respectively, and a 10% absolute difference in tolerability. This sample
                    size would also provide a 95% confidence interval width of about 6 mmHg
                    and 0.3 mmol/L for estimates of SBP and LDL-cholesterol reductions
                    respectively. Primary analysis was by intention-to-treat. Means of changes in blood pressure
                    and lipid values from baseline to 12 weeks between polypill and placebo groups
                    were compared using a 2 sample t-test. Adjusted analyses were carried out by
                    including the stratification factors in an analysis of covariance regression
                    model with change in blood pressure and lipid variable as the dependent
                    variable. Last observation carried forward was used for missing data at 12
                    weeks, with a sensitivity analysis also based on repeated measures using a mixed
                    models approach to the analysis of covariance. The proportions that withdrew
                    from trial treatment (tolerability) at 12 weeks between polypill and placebo
                    groups were compared using the chi-squared test, with those without follow-up
                    information assumed to have stopped study treatment. It was determined after
                    trial completion that there had been mislabeling of a sequence of treatment
                    packs that affected 14 participants who received active treatment rather than
                    placebo. Therefore an additional sensitivity analysis was conducted excluding
                    these participants. All analyses were done using SAS [version
                    9.1.3]. Expected reductions in cardiovascular risk were estimated using data from
                    systematic reviews, which have shown that each medication class confers
                    approximately similar proportional reductions in cause-specific outcomes across
                    a wide range of patient populations, with no major differences between agents
                    (after accounting for the extent of risk factor reduction for SBP and LDL) and
                    even when event rates vary tenfold or more.[17], [18], [19], [20], [21] For example,
                    aspirin produces about a one-fifth reduction in CHD and ischaemic stroke risk in
                    ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ prevention.[20]
                    There is clear evidence that the proportional reductions in major outcomes
                    achieved with each treatment modality are approximately the same in the presence
                    or absence of other interventions[17], [19], [20], [22] (which is
                    expected given the lack of interaction between treatments in terms of risk
                    factor reduction[23] and the epidemiology of blood pressure and
                    cholesterol joint effects[24], [25]). Therefore,
                    the combined effects are best estimated by multiplying relative risks together,
                    after adjusting for the size of SBP and LDL-cholesterol reductions. Thus for
                    example, since 1 mmol/L LDL-cholesterol reduction, 10 mmHg SBP reduction and
                    aspirin each individually lower CHD risk by 42%[5], 22%[17] and
                        20%[20] respectively (ie. RRs are 0.58, 0.78 and 0.80
                    respectively), the expected joint effects of a 0.5 mmol/L LDL-cholesterol
                    reduction, 5 mmHg SBP reduction and aspirin would be approximately a 46%
                    lower CHD risk (since
                    0.580.5/1.0×0.785/10×0.80 = 0.54,
                    and (1−0.54) ×100%  = 46%).
                    Combining the proportional effects with data on current event rates (rather than
                    event rates in trials, which are often out of date and not representative),
                    provides the best estimates of expected absolute treatment effects.[26], [27] A total of 378 participants were randomised into the study (Figure 1) from 17 October 2008 to 22 December
                2009. At 12 weeks, vital status was available for 373 (98.7%) of participants
                and data on SBP and LDL-cholesterol levels were available for 338 (89.4%).
                There was good balance between randomised groups across a range of characteristics
                at study entry (Table 1). The
                frequency distributions for age, SBP, LDL-cholesterol and estimated 5-year
                cardiovascular risk are shown in Figure
                    2. As can be seen, most patients were aged between 50 and 70 years and
                there was a wide range of baseline SBP and LDL-cholesterol levels; for example
                according to JNC 7 criteria[28] 33% would be regarded as having
                ‘hypertension’ with SBP >140 mmHg, 52%
                ‘pre-hypertension’ with SBP 120–139, and 14% having
                ‘normal’ blood pressure of SBP <120 mmHg. Overall 22% of
                participants had a 5-year cardiovascular risk of 5–7.5% by the
                Framingham function (all of whom had two or more other risk factors, see Methods), and 3% had 5-year cardiovascular
                risk over 20% (ie. equivalent to the risk faced by those with previous
                vascular disease events[29]).  This figure shows the flow of patients through the trial according to the
                        criteria recommended in the CONSORT Guidelines.

                        their baseline levels of age, LDL-cholesterol, SBP and 5-year cardiovascular

              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019857.t001 Over the duration of follow-up, SBP was reduced by an average of 9.9 (95%
                    CI: 7.7 to 12.1) mmHg compared to the placebo group, while LDL-cholesterol was
                    reduced by an average of 0.8 (95% CI: 0.6 to 0.9) mmol/L (both
                    p<0.0001, see Figure 3).
                    Treatment differences were achieved at two weeks and maintained throughout
                    follow-up. Overall effect estimates were not importantly altered by adjusted
                    analyses or by the exclusion of participants receiving mislabeled treatment
                    packs (SBP reduction 10.4, 95% CI 8.1 to 12.7 mmHg and LDL-cholesterol
                    reduction 0.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.9 mmol/L).  This figure shows the changes in blood pressure and LDL-cholesterol over
                            the 12 week trial period, according to active (dark line) or placebo
                            (grey line). 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019857.g003 There was also a reduction in DBP of 5.3 mmHg (95% CI 3.9 to 6.7,
                    p<<0.001), in total cholesterol of 0.8 mmol/L (95%CI,
                    0.7–1.0, p<0.001) and in triglycerides of 0.2 mmol/L (95%CI
                    0.1−0.3, p = 0.001). There was no clear effect on HDL
                    (0.02 mmol/L increase, 95% CI −0.04 to 0.04,
                    p = 0.9). Overall through the 12 weeks, 44 (23%) in the polypill group compared to
                    33 (18%) in the placebo group discontinued treatment (RR 1.33, 95%
                    CI 0.89 to 2.00 p = 0.2). Most discontinuations occurred
                    early: 29 (66%) of the 44 discontinuations in the polypill group occurred
                    by week 6. The main reasons for discontinuation of trial treatment by randomised
                    group are shown in Table
                    2.  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019857.t002 A total of 110 (58%) of the polypill group and 79 (42%) of the
                    control group reported side effects (p = 0.001). Most side
                    effects did not necessitate stopping treatment. The excesses were mainly
                    attributable to the well known side effects of aspirin [gastric irritation
                    and/or bleeding tendency occurring in 32 (17%) of the polypill group and
                    11 (6%) of the placebo group] and of ACE inhibitor-based blood
                    pressure lowering [cough and/or light headedness, dizziness or hypotension
                    occurring in 57 (30%) of the polypill group and 20 (11%) of the
                    placebo group]. Most side effects were apparent early on: at week 2, side
                    effects were reported by 41% vs 26% (77 vs 49 people), whereas
                    only 14% vs 11% (26 vs 20) reported new side effects in week 6 and
                    only 4% vs 5% (7 vs 10) reported new side effects at week 12. A
                    total of 353 participants answered the question “what trial treatment do
                    you think you have been taking?” at the end of follow-up. The answer was
                    correct for 79% (139/177) of people allocated polypill and for 59%
                    (104/176) of people allocated placebo (p<0.0001 for difference). Eight serious adverse events were reported, four in each group (polypill group -
                    chest pain, newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes, removal of wisdom teeth, syncope;
                    placebo group – syncope, depression, transient ischaemic attack, hip
                    fracture). There were no deaths, major vascular events, major bleeds or episodes
                    of gastrointestinal ulceration. Overall, the proportion of scheduled treatment taken according to self-reported
                    pill counts was 82% for the polypill group and 86% for the placebo
                    group (p = 0.1). Open-label therapy was required
                    infrequently during follow-up: for blood pressure lowering (4 vs 3
                    participants), cholesterol lowering (0 vs 4) and antiplatelet therapy (2 vs
                    3). The estimated effects on cardiovascular events and other major outcomes for those
                    continuing treatment long-term are shown in Table 3. One would expect an approximate
                    60% reduction in CHD and ischaemic stroke risk, little overall effect on
                    haemorrhagic stroke risk (the beneficial effects of blood pressure lowering
                    balancing out the adverse effects of aspirin) and a 50% increase in the
                    risk of extra-cranial bleeding. The net effects of such treatment on any major
                    outcome thus importantly depend on the event rates of each component outcome. In
                    a patient group at similar risk to the average in this trial one would expect
                    more than a halving in CVD events and about a halving in any major event
                    (stroke, CHD or major bleed). Over 5 years of treatment, about 1 in 18 would
                    benefit in terms of avoiding a major event, with the large majority of the net
                    benefit due to the SBP and LDL-reduction. Among untreated individuals with a
                    history of coronary artery disease, event rates are higher, particularly for CHD
                    and ischaemic stroke.[29], [30] Hence compared to a lower-risk population, the
                    proportional reductions for the composite of any major event are a little
                    greater and the absolute benefits are much greater, being of clear clinical
                    importance for each component. Overall about 1 in 4 high risk people would be
                    predicted to avoid a major event over 5 years.  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019857.t003 These results show that treatment with this polypill achieved sizeable reductions in
                SBP and LDL-cholesterol. These risk factor reductions, together with the findings of
                systematic reviews of the component medicines, indicate that this treatment can be
                expected to more than halve cardiovascular risk. Starting treatment with this
                polypill caused side effects sufficient to stop treatment in about 1 in 20 people.
                Other less serious side effects occurred in about 1 in 8 people, with most becoming
                apparent after just a few weeks of treatment. There are several limitations of this study. The relatively short follow-up precluded
                assessment of the long-term rates of drop-out. It is well recognized, for example,
                that gastric bleeding due to aspirin can occur months or even years after starting
                treatment. However, placebo-controlled trials of the separate components of this
                polypill show that most long-term drop-out is not related to side effects (i.e.
                drop-out rates in the placebo group are much more than half those in the active
                group) and that long-term dropout rates are much lower than those observed early
                after starting treatment. Nonetheless, the effects on cardiovascular events
                estimated here only apply to those staying on treatment long-term. While
                characteristic side effects were the only ones evident, the design precluded
                definitive attribution of which component caused which side effects. The patient
                population represented a relatively narrow group, having raised cardiovascular risk
                and no existing indications for any of the medicines. However, history of
                symptomatic cardiovascular disease does not modify the extent of risk factor
                reductions, which are likely to be broadly generalisable.[4], [5] Finally, the predicted reductions
                in cardiovascular risk are based on reductions in risk factor levels and, while it
                appears that blood pressure or LDL-cholesterol reductions account for most or all of
                the benefits,[17],
                    [18], [19], [20], [21], [31], [32] these are
                nonetheless indirect estimates. Two previous trials have assessed the effects of polypill treatment compared to
                control on risk factor reductions, tolerability and estimated cardiovascular risk,
                and their results are compared with the current study and Wald and Law's
                original predictions in Table
                    4. The Indian Polycap Study (TIPS) randomized 2,053 individuals without
                cardiovascular disease, aged 45–80 years and with one or more risk factors, to
                12 weeks treatment with the Polycap (hydrochlorothiazide 12·5 mg, atenolol 50
                mg, ramipril 5 mg, simvastatin 20 mg and aspirin 100 mg), or to one of eight other
                groups: aspirin alone, simvastatin alone, hydrochlorothiazide alone, three
                combinations of the two blood pressure lowering drugs, three blood pressure lowering
                drugs alone, or three blood pressure lowering drugs plus aspirin.[23] This
                design allowed demonstration that the risk factor reductions from each treatment
                modality were essentially the same in the presence and absence of other
                        treatments.[23] Malekzadeh et al conducted a double-blind
                randomised placebo controlled trial in residents of Golestan, Iran.[33] Following
                an 8-week placebo run-in period, 475 participants, aged 50 to 79 years, without
                cardiovascular disease, hypertension or hyperlipidaemia were randomised to
                fixed-dose combination therapy (aspirin 81 mg, enalapril 2.5 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg
                and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) or placebo for a period of 12 months. Both trials
                had relatively high non-attendance at final follow-up: 16% in TIPS and
                27% in the Malekzadeh et al trial (22% in the control group and
                33% in the polypill group, p = 0.02 for difference),
                compared to 1% in the current trial. Therefore TIPS and in particular the
                Malekzadeh et al trial were more prone to bias, especially when assessing side
                effects since these are often associated with loss to follow-up.  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019857.t004 The risk factor reductions in TIPS were comparable in size to those observed in the
                current trial, even though the Polycap contained an additional blood pressure
                lowering agent. At the end of 12 weeks, 66/412 (16%) people in the Polycap
                group had stopped taking study treatment compared to 34/189 (18%) in the
                current trial. TIPS could not estimate total excess (ie. placebo-corrected) side
                effects, since each comparison group contained at least one active component.
                However it did report no clear difference in side effect rates between the different
                active groups. The risk factor reductions in the Malekzadeh trial were notably lower
                than both TIPS and the current trial, but this may well be due to low baseline
                levels (which were differential between the groups for blood pressure, p<0.0001),
                loss to follow-up and non-adherence. The reported rates of side effects were also
                very low, with only 40/475 (8%) participants reporting reluctance to take
                study treatment and only 2/475 (0.4%) reporting adverse drug reactions. This
                is likely to be in large part attributable to the combined impact of loss to
                follow-up, under-reporting and non-adherence. One further active-controlled trial has recently been completed, in which 216
                individuals from Sri Lanka who were aged over 50 years old if female and over 40
                years if male, and who had an estimated 10-year total CVD risk score >20%,
                based on WHO CVD risk prediction charts, were randomized to a polypill (containing
                75 mg aspirin, 20 mg simvastatin, 10 mg lisinopril and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide)
                or to standard practice.[34] The results suggested similar reduction in risk factors
                and predicted cardiovascular risk in both groups. This is the first trial to empirically test Wald and Law's predictions of side
                effects attributable to a polypill: Table 4 shows that the observed excess of side effects is considerably
                greater than that predicted. The risk factor reductions seen in the current trial
                are also about half the size predicted by Wald and Law,[6] mostly because those estimates
                were based on higher baseline risk factor levels, use of a more potent statin and an
                extra blood pressure lowering agent. Interestingly however the estimated reductions
                in CHD and stroke from this polypill are only about 25–30% smaller than
                those of Wald and Law. This is because of the diminishing marginal returns from
                additional reductions in single risk factors, and the multiplicative benefits of
                adding different treatment modalities ie. less risk reduction from one modality
                leaves ‘more to slice off’ for the next modality. What are the implications of these findings for research and clinical practice? Among
                patients at low-to-moderate global cardiovascular risk, further work is required on
                polypill formulations and target patient populations. This trial suggests that the
                short-term tolerability of a polypill is not as good as previous predictions or
                trials have suggested, although still nonetheless causing no symptoms in 5 out of 6
                people treated. Most side effects, including virtually all major ones, would be due
                to aspirin, and the inclusion of aspirin in combination treatment provides modest
                net benefits,[20] although recent data showing that aspirin reduces the
                incidence of cancer will change this risk-balance equation back again. Nonetheless,
                even among patients at moderately elevated risk, such as the average in this trial
                (which is considerably higher than the risk faced by individuals with, for example,
                uncomplicated hypertension, dyslipidaemia or diabetes) the absolute benefits of
                aspirin would be small. For such individuals whose risk has first been reduced by
                blood pressure and cholesterol lowering, aspirin would only avoid a major event in
                every thousand or more patients per year. Polypills based on blood pressure and
                cholesterol lowering agents are therefore required, along with research on their
                benefits and risks compared to usual care. An area of controversy will be whether
                such trials should assess hard cardiovascular endpoints (taking many years to
                complete) or just measure side effects and BP and LDL reduction, given the
                conclusive evidence of the event reduction from individual treatments, the lack of
                interaction between the treatments, and the finding that most or all of the benefits
                are due to the extent of BP or LDL reduction. [17], [19], [20], [22] One further issue is that although
                efficacy of blood pressure and cholesterol lowering has been clearly established
                well below historical ‘hypertension’ and ‘dyslipidaemia’
                    thresholds,[21],
                    [35], [36] indications
                currently approved by regulatory authorities and much clinical practice is
                restricted to those with ‘hypertension’ or ‘dyslipidaemia’
                (regardless of the level of cardiovascular risk). Among patients with a history of occlusive vascular disease, further evidence on
                efficacy for individual medication classes is not required, since this has been
                established with clinical trials involving many tens of thousands of patient over
                half a century. All major cross-disciplinary guidelines[9], [23], [37] recommend some form of blood
                pressure lowering, cholesterol lowering and antiplatelet therapy in patients with
                vascular disease. Research is therefore only required on the comparative roles of
                polypill-based treatment compared to usual care in delivering these therapies
                long-term. People with previous symptomatic vascular disease are relatively easily
                identified, more motivated to take treatment and account for almost half of all
                major cardiovascular events. Among this group the benefits of this combination
                therapy substantially outweigh the side effects, and one could reasonably expect
                similar-sized benefits in asymptomatic patients at equivalently high risk, who
                comprise about 5% of the adult population.[38] Yet the vast majority of
                highest-risk people globally do not receive such treatment long-term. In
                economically developed countries most are now prescribed recommended medicines after
                an acute event, but many do not continue: only one- to two-thirds of people with a
                history of vascular disease take antiplatelet, blood pressure lowering and statin
                therapy long-term.[39], [40], [41], [42] In economically developing countries, where 80% of
                the global burden of cardiovascular disease occurs,[43] very few receive these
                medicines in the short or long-term.[44], [45] With current approaches, these treatment gaps are closing
                very slowly.[46]
                Increasing access to treatment is a potentially highly cost-effective strategy[47], [48], [49] and alone
                could achieve most of WHO's goals for reducing non-communicable disease.[50] Trial Protocol doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0019857.s001 (DOC) CONSORT Checklist doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0019857.s002 (PDF)
