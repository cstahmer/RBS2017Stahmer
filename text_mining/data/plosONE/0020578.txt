   Traditionally, people have inhabited places with ready access to fresh water.
                    Today, over 50% of the global population lives in urban areas, and water
                    can be directed via tens of kilometres of pipelines. Still, however, a large
                    part of the world's population is directly dependent on access to natural
                    freshwater sources. So how are inhabited places related to the location of
                    freshwater bodies today? We present a high-resolution global analysis of how
                    close present-day populations live to surface freshwater. We aim to increase the
                    understanding of the relationship between inhabited places, distance to surface
                    freshwater bodies, and climatic characteristics in different climate zones and
                    administrative regions. Our results show that over 50% of the
                    world's population lives closer than 3 km to a surface freshwater body, and
                    only 10% of the population lives further than 10 km away. There are,
                    however, remarkable differences between administrative regions and climatic
                    zones. Populations in Australia, Asia, and Europe live closest to water.
                    Although populations in arid zones live furthest away from freshwater bodies in
                    absolute terms, relatively speaking they live closest to water considering the
                    limited number of freshwater bodies in those areas. Population distributions in
                    arid zones show statistically significant relationships with a combination of
                    climatic factors and distance to water, whilst in other zones there is no
                    statistically significant relationship with distance to water. Global studies on
                    development and climate adaptation can benefit from an improved understanding of
                    these relationships between human populations and the distance to fresh
                    water. Citation: Kummu M, de Moel H, Ward PJ, Varis O (2011) How Close Do We Live to Water? A Global Analysis of Population Distance to Freshwater Bodies. PLoS ONE 6(6):

                inhabited places close to rivers or lakes to ensure water supply for several
                purposes, including household water supply and water for agriculture and livestock
                    [1]. Human
                population has increased rapidly during the past century, from 1.6 billion in 1900
                    [2] to
                6.9 billion in 2010 [3]. Over the same period, the percentage of the global
                population living in urban areas has increased from around 16% in 1900 (i.e.
                0.3 billion people) [2] to over 50% in 2010 (i.e. 3.5 billion) [4]. Over time, the
                relationship between human populations and freshwater bodies – and the direct
                dependence of humans on them – has changed, due to physical (e.g. pollution of
                water bodies), socioeconomic (e.g. increased population, urbanisation, and economic
                development), and cultural (e.g. aesthetic preferences and traditional habits)
                factors [5]. It could therefore be argued that today, in many parts of the world, the geographical
                distance to a freshwater source is not as vital for everyday survival as it was in
                the past. Recent technological developments have made it possible to pump
                groundwater from hundreds of metres below the ground and to convey it over long
                distances at reasonable cost through pipes and canals [6]. In addition, water can be
                purified efficiently and desalinisation is increasingly carried out in various arid
                areas [7]. However, despite these technological developments, which have ensured clean water
                supply for large numbers of the world's population, over 800 million people
                still live without improved sources (as in the WHO definition) of drinking water
                    [8]. This
                development deficit is in part due to lack of investments required to implement such
                measures [9], either
                due to a lack of financial resources or other factors such as lack of institutional
                capacity, political will, and war. Hence, almost one billion people collect their
                water from distant, unprotected sources [8]; for these people the geographic
                distance to water bodies is still of vital importance. For many others, who are
                supplied with clean water, the proximity to rivers and lakes remains an important
                issue for aesthetic, cultural, and other reasons [1]. A short distance to water is,
                however, not always a positive factor. For example, in flood-prone agricultural
                areas (such as the Lower Mekong floodplains and large parts of Bangladesh), annual
                flooding may be essential for agriculture and fisheries, but living too close to the
                river can make populations vulnerable in the event of an extreme flood [10]. Many of the key factors that enable a good supply of water are unevenly distributed
                among the global population, such as: wealth [11], [12], human population [3], [13], and water
                resource availability [14]–[16]. Densely populated areas often do not overlap with areas
                that are water-rich [17]. This population pressure is projected to increase
                further in most countries [3] and the changing climate is also expected to increase the
                pressure on water resources in the future [14]–[16]. Hence, there is an
                increasing recognition of the need to adapt to these changes in both socioeconomic
                and physical drivers [18]. Global studies on climate adaptation and development
                would benefit from an improved understanding of the relationship between human
                populations and the distance to freshwater. However, to the best of our knowledge there are no such comprehensive assessments of
                relationships between human populations and the distance that they live from
                freshwater bodies. This is despite the availability of high resolution population
                density datasets [13], [19] which have, in recent years, led to advances in studies
                examining other factors responsible for the geographical distribution of people
                around the globe. Examples of such factors include: urban centres [12], sea coasts
                    [20], volcanism
                    [21], and
                biodiversity [22]. In this paper we examine relationships between population density and the distance to
                surface freshwater bodies, in order to address the following research goals: In this research we examined the distance of human populations to freshwater bodies
                (rivers or lakes) using the population geographical Euclidean distance. This
                represents the closest distance of a freshwater body, in a straight line, from an
                inhabited area. The analyses could also have been carried out based on the closest
                upstream freshwater body, i.e. calculating the distance to a freshwater body from
                which water could be channelled by gravity. Often, however, people depending on
                freshwater bodies do not have the possibility to direct water through pipes or
                canals, but instead walk to or pump up the water according to their needs. Naturally, some kind of weighting factor could also be introduced, as was done by the
                    World Bank
                [12] in their study
                of travel times to urban centres. In the World Bank study, the travel time was
                calculated based on factors such as terrain, road class, and transportation options.
                However, we used the population geographical Euclidean distance method because the
                weighting factors would vary significantly depending on the use of water, and few
                data are available at the global scale for developing such factors. Distance to water was first calculated on a global grid at a resolution of 1
                km×1 km. For each grid-cell we calculated the average distance of each land
                cell to its closest freshwater body, referred to here as land distance to
                    water (dwland). The results of the
                        dwland were used to assess the population
                distance to the closest freshwater body, referred to here as population
                    distance to water (dwpop); this was carried
                out at various geographical scales (e.g. administrative, physical). We also assessed
                the dwpop for different classes of population (urban,
                peri-urban, rural) and freshwater bodies (lakes and three classes of rivers). For
                calculating the median dwpop for different scales, we
                used the population as weighting factor for the dwland
                data: we first sorted the cells by distance and then calculated the cumulative
                population. The median dwpop was the distance
                corresponding to 50% of the cumulative population in the list. In the rest of this section we describe the methods used in more detail. Firstly, we
                describe the data sources and their preparation for use in our study. Secondly, we
                describe the geographical scales on which we carried out the analyses. Finally, we
                describe the methods used to analyse the data. The data used in this study can be roughly divided into four sorts: population,
                    freshwater bodies, climate, and geographical boundaries (see Table 1).  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020578.t001 Of the available population density datasets [2], [13],
                            [19],
                        we found the LandScanTM 2007 data [13] (see Supporting
                            Information S1) to be the most suitable for our analysis as it
                        provides information at the most spatially disaggregated level. LandScanTM
                        has a resolution of 30″ (∼1 km at the equator), and the population
                        distribution is based on census data compiled using a multi-layered spatial
                        modelling approach [13]. The main input data are: census information;
                        administrative boundaries; land cover; coastlines; elevation; and imagery
                            [13]. According to the documentation of the dataset
                            [13], the distance to water was not part of the
                        modelling parameters. Therefore, the data are not biased in that sense and
                        can be used for our analysis. The LandScanTM 2007 dataset does not, however, provide any delineation
                        between urban and rural population. We therefore used two separate datasets
                        to identify the urban, peri-urban, and rural areas (Table 1). According to Potere et al.
                            [23],
                        the MODIS 500 m resolution global urban map [24] has the highest
                        accuracy for mapping urban areas. Therefore, we selected this dataset to
                        identify urban extent. We then used the GRUMP dataset [25] (which was assessed by
                        Potere et al [23] as the least accurate presentation of urban
                        settlement), together with MODIS 500 m data, to identify the peri-urban
                        areas. The peri-urban area is here defined as the area of the GRUMP dataset
                        that is not covered by the MODIS 500 m urban extent area. The area that is
                        covered by neither the MODIS 500 m global urban map nor by the GRUMP data is
                        defined as rural area (Supporting Information S1). For our analysis we used four classes of freshwater bodies, namely: lakes,
                        large rivers, medium rivers, and small rivers (Table 1; Supporting
                            Information S1). From here on we refer to these classes as water
                        feature groups (WFGs). The spatial data for these water features are based
                        on the VMAP0 (Vector Map Level Zero) dataset [26]. Only perennial water
                        bodies were included in the analysis; wetlands and seasonal rivers were
                        excluded. Of course, in some regions populations do rely on these ephemeral
                        water sources; for example, they have determined the seasonality in farming
                        in the Middle East for millennia [27]. The freshwater bodies were mapped using VMAP0 polygon data, which have a
                        scale of approximately 1∶1,000,000 [26]. From the VMAP0 data, we
                        extracted permanent lakes and large rivers using the Global Lake and Wetland
                        Database (GLWD) [28]. In the latter database, large rivers are derived
                        from the Level 2 data of GLWD (i.e. GLWD-2); this dataset contains the
                        shoreline polygons of permanent open water bodies with a surface area
                        ≥0.1 km2. The medium and small rivers were extracted from the
                        VMAP0 data using the World Data Bank II (WDB II) dataset [29]. This
                        datasets has a resolution of 1∶3,000,000; those rivers identified in
                        the WDBII were extracted from the VMAP0 data and classed as medium rivers.
                        The remaining rivers in VMAP0 (i.e. those that were not classed as large or
                        medium rivers) were then classed as small rivers. The VMAP0 river network is homogenous for most regions. However, for parts of
                        South America and Asia, there are some differences in the level of detail in
                        the mapping of the network. Despite this shortcoming, we believe that VMAP0
                        is still the most suitable dataset to be used in this kind of analysis. The
                        recent HydroSHEDS (Hydrological data and maps based on Shuttle Elevation
                        Derivatives at multiple Scales) data [30] have higher accuracy
                        than the VMAP0 data, but the HydroSHEDS data do not cover the entire globe
                        (the dataset cover only areas south from Latitude 50°N), and thus the
                        dataset is not suitable for this study. Due to data availability, the small streams, local surface waters, and
                        temporal water bodies including wetlands were excluded from our analysis,
                        although they are vital sources of water and livelihood in many parts of the
                        world. Groundwater abstraction is also an important source of water in
                        various regions [31], [32], but is not included
                        in this analysis due to poor data availability. Neither does our study take
                        into account the state of a water body in question, although water of poor
                        quality may not be usable at all. Such information should be included in
                        future global analyses if appropriate global data become available. The
                        scale of the data used in the study should also be taken into account when
                        interpreting our results. Distance to water was first calculated on a global grid at a resolution of 1
                    km×1 km. The data were then aggregated to a 5 km×5 km resolution for
                    computational reasons, before being analysed at various geographical scales,
                    namely: Food Producing Units (FPUs); country scale; regional scale; and climate
                    zones. For the regional scale we used geographical boundaries that divide the globe into
                    12 regions (based on Kummu et al. [17], modified from UN [33]). The FPUs
                    are based on work carried out by IFPRI (International Food Policy Research
                    Institute) and IWMI (International Water Management Institute). These FPUs
                    divide the world into 281 sub-basins, each sub-basin representing a hybrid
                    between river basins and economic regions [34]–[36]. The original FPU map
                    was slightly adjusted by Kummu et al.
                    [17] to include
                    three regions (Siberia, Iceland, and Alaska) that were collectively grouped as a
                    ‘rest of the world’ FPU in the original data. Furthermore, some
                    low-lying (coastal) areas and small islands, which were originally not in any
                    FPU, were merged with the closest FPU [17]. For the climate zones, we
                    used five different zones (equatorial, arid, temperate, cold, and polar) based
                    on the Köppen climate zones [37]. To calculate the distance to water, we first converted the maps of the four WFGs
                    (see above and Table 1) to
                    raster format and merged these into one layer. We then used the WFG map to
                    calculate, for each grid-cell (including land and freshwater area), the
                    geographical Euclidean distance to the closest water body, i.e. ‘land
                    distance to water’ (dwland). We also
                    calculated a ‘water feature map’ which shows, for each grid-cell,
                    the class of the freshwater body closest to it (Supporting
                        Information S1). Using the dwland dataset, combined with the
                        population density dataset, we were able to calculate the ‘population
                        distance to water’. This dwpop corresponds
                        to the median distance of a person to the nearest freshwater body. We
                        calculated dwpop for all geographical scales
                        presented above, and for each different population and water feature
                        group. For each FPU we also analysed whether people lived closer to, or further
                        from, freshwater bodies than the average dwland
                        for that FPU. This was assessed using the ratio of
                            dwpop over
                            dwland, referred to hereafter as
                                dwrpop/land. We also analysed the average population density and cumulative population as
                        a function of dwland. This was carried out
                        separately for each population class and for each climate zone. With this
                        analysis we aimed to visualise how population densities change with
                        increasing distances to water, and to illustrate how this differs between
                        population groups and climate zones. We used several climate variables (precipitation, temperature, and aridity
                        index), together with dwpop and
                                dwland, to explore whether population
                        density could be explained by these physical characteristics. Bivariate
                        correlation and multiple regression analysis tools of the SPSS programme
                        (version 19) were used to analyse the correlations between the variables in
                        question. Finally, we used estimates of water resources availability per capita from
                        Kummu et al. [17] to examine relationships between population
                        distance to water and water scarcity. Data for these two variables per FPU
                        were used to construct a 3×3 matrix with the following thresholds: Land distance to water (dwland) shows large spatial
                variations across the globe; the results are shown per square kilometre in Figure 1, panel A. Small values of
                        dwland are found in the far northern latitudes
                (>50° latitude), where there are numerous lakes and rivers (Supporting Information
                    S1), and therefore freshwater bodies are close nearly everywhere (Figure 1A). Relatively close
                proximity to water can also be seen in large swathes of the tropics, especially in
                South and Southeast Asia, parts of the Amazon basin, and tropical parts of Africa.
                The largest values of dwland are found in desert areas
                of Northern and Southern Africa, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Asia, and
                Australia (Figure 1A). Greenland
                and the Antarctic are also (at least seasonally) scarce of liquid water, although
                there is plenty of ice and snow.  A: Average land distance to fresh water for each square kilometre of land
                                (dwland). B: Median distance of
                        population to water (dwpop) at FPU (Food
                        Production Unit) scale. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020578.g001 The pattern of the median dwpop per FPU generally
                    follows the pattern of dwland, with relatively short
                    distances (<2 km) in northern latitudes and in the tropics, and relatively
                    long distances (>5 km) in the more arid areas (Figure 1B). Globally, the median value of
                            dwpop is 3.0 km (Table 2), although there are distinct
                    differences between regions, climatic zones, and water feature and population
                    classes. These differences will be explored in the following subsections.  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020578.t002 Globally, just over half of the population (53%) lives in rural areas,
                        whilst rural areas account for 94% of the total inhabited area (Table 2). On the other
                        hand, whilst about 47% of the world population lives in urban and
                        peri-urban areas (according to our division), these areas account for just
                        6% of the total inhabited area (being 1.6% of the total land
                        surface area on Earth). On this global scale, the median
                                dwpop shows very little difference
                        between urban, peri-urban, and rural populations (Table 2); however, there are differences
                        between regions, as will be presented and discussed later. Moreover, if we examine how population density changes in relation to the
                                dwland, we see clear differences between
                        the population classes (Figure
                            2). In total, around half of the world's population lives
                        within 3 km of a freshwater body, whilst 90% lives within 10 km.
                        Globally, average population density gradually falls from over 150
                            persons/km2 in areas closer than 2 km to a freshwater body,
                        to around 50–60 persons/km2 in areas at a distance of 25 km
                        from a freshwater body (Figure
                            2, bar graph). This reduction in population density as
                                dwland increases appears to be
                        attributable to the situation in rural regions. Figure 2 (line graphs) shows that the
                        population density remains rather stable as the
                            dwland increases in urban and peri-urban
                        areas, whilst a clear decrease is seen for rural areas. This would seem to
                        suggest that proximity to freshwater bodies is more defining for where
                        people live in rural areas compared to the situation in urban and peri-urban
                        areas.  The population densities for urban, peri-urban, and rural populations
                                are presented as lines while the total average population density is
                                presented as bars. Note: y-axis has a logarithmic scale; global
                                average population densities are presented with a linear scale in
                                    Figure
                                3. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020578.g002 For the majority of the world population (66%) the closest water
                        feature is a small river, while for only 6.5% of the population it is
                        a large river (Table
                        3). The population density is highest, however, in inhabited areas
                        where the closest water feature is a large river (Table 3). Based on the results derived
                        from the datasets used, humans inhabit about 38% of the total surface
                        area of the globe (Table
                            3). For those areas where a river is the closest water feature,
                        humans inhabit over 40% of the area, while for areas where a lake is
                        the closest water feature, only about 21% is inhabited (Table 3). This can be
                        explained by the fact that many of the areas in which a lake is the closest
                        freshwater feature are located in sparsely populated regions in high
                        northern latitudes or in deserts or arctic areas (Supporting
                            Information S1).  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020578.t003 The median distance of population to water varies between the WFGs from 2.2
                        km (large rivers) to 4.6 km (lakes) (Table 3; see also Supporting
                            Information S2). The relatively large distance to lakes can be
                        explained by the same reasoning as the low inhabited ratio (see above). The
                        relatively low population distance to water associated with large rivers can
                        be related to the large population density, which appears to congregate
                        around (inhabited sections of) large rivers. The decrease in global average population density as
                                dwland increases is shown again in Figure 3. In this figure,
                        however, the cumulative population living in different climatic zones is
                        also shown, revealing considerable differences between the climatic regions.
                        Whilst on a global scale about 70% of the population lives within 5
                        km of the closest water feature, this is around 80% for temperate and
                        cold regions. On the other hand, only 55% of the population in arid
                        areas lives within 5 km of the nearest water feature. Hence, in these areas,
                        where water is already (by definition) scarce, the distance to those scarce
                        sources is also relatively large. The median distance to water in arid zones
                        is 4.3 km, compared to 2.8 km in cold and temperate zones.  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020578.g003 According to our analyses, people live on average closest to water in
                        Australia and Oceania (median dwpop 2.3 km),
                        followed by Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and Western Europe
                        (2.6 km) (Figure 4).
                        People in Northern Africa (4.3 km) and Middle East (4.8 km) live, on
                        average, the furthest from water (Figure 4).  Columns show the results per population class (urban, peri-urban,
                                rural) while the total average distance to water is presented below
                                the abbreviation of the region. The abbreviations for the regions
                                are as follows: Au&Oc-Australia and Oceania; CAm-Central
                                America; EA-Eastern Asia; EE&CA-Eastern Europe and Central Asia;
                                SA-South Asia; LAm-Latin America; ME-Middle East; M&SAf-Middle
                                and Southern Africa; NAf-North Africa; NAm-North America;
                                SEA-Southeast Asia; and WE-Western Europe. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020578.g004 The clearest difference in median dwpop between
                        population classes can be seen for North Africa, where the distance to water
                        in rural areas is more than double that in urban and peri-urban areas (Figure 4). In most
                        regions, the dwpop for urban populations tends
                        to be rather similar to the dwpop for rural
                        populations (difference less than 0.5 km). Interesting differences are in
                        the Middle East and North Africa, where urban populations live closer to
                        water than rural populations, contrasting with the Americas, where rural
                        populations live closer to water than urban populations. We also calculated the median dwpop for each
                        country with more than 100,000 inhabitants. According to the results, people
                        in Suriname live closest to water (median dwpop
                        was 1.6 km); the median distance is also less than 2.0 km in Kyrgyzstan and
                        Tajikistan. The people of Libya live, on average, the furthest from water
                        (233 km). All the country results are presented in Supporting
                            Information S2. As described in the methods section, the ratio
                            dwrpop/land per FPU was used to examine
                        whether people live closer to, or further from, freshwater bodies than the
                        average land distance to water for that FPU. These ratios are shown in Figure 5. In large parts
                        of the world, the population distance to water is, on average, similar to
                        the dwland, i.e. the
                                dwrpop/land is close to 1 (roughly one
                        quarter of the data fall below a threshold of 0.8 while the median is 0.88;
                        see Supporting Information S2). For many arid areas, however, the
                        ratio dwrpop/land is relatively low (Supporting
                            Information S2); these areas include Australia, the Sahara, and
                        Central Asia. On average, the populations in these areas live much closer to
                        water than the average dwland (Figure 5).  In areas where the ratio is smaller than 1, people live relatively
                                close to water as the average dwpop is
                                lower than the average dwland in that
                                FPU. For areas with a ratio greater than 1, on the other hand, the
                                opposite is the case and people live relatively far from freshwater
                                sources. The thresholds are derived from the statistical analysis as
                                follows:
                                        dwrpop/land
                                is between 0.5–1.3 for 95% of the cases, and between
                                0.8 and 1.0 in 50% of the cases (i.e. the grey values
                                represent FPUs within this 50% interval). 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020578.g005 We also calculated the regional ratios of
                            dwrpop/land per climate zone (Table 4; Supporting
                            Information S2). Again, we see that the ratio is lowest in arid
                        zones, except for in Southeastern Asia, where populations in temperate zones
                        live closest to water (Table
                            4). For half of the regions, the ratio is highest in the
                        temperate zone, while for others it is highest in either the cold or
                        tropical zones (Table
                            4). In many regions the differences are, however, rather small.
                        At the regional scale, ratio of dwrpop/land was
                        smallest in Asia and largest in North America (Table 4; Supporting
                            Information S2).  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020578.t004 In order to examine statistical relationships at the FPU scale between
                        population density and physical characteristics, we performed bivariate and
                        multiple regressions using the SPSS software for the variables shown in
                            Table 5. Data on
                        precipitation and temperature were taken from the WorldClim v1.4 database
                            [38],
                        and refer to mean annual values for the period 1960–1990. We also used
                        the aridity index of CGIAR [39]; this index
                        represents the ratio of mean annual precipitation over mean annual potential
                        evapotranspiration. The regression results are shown for the globe and per
                        climate zone in Table
                            5. Bivariate regression results between all parameters (on a
                        global scale) and multiple regression analysis for different arid regions
                        are presented in Supporting Information S2.  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020578.t005 On a global scale, we found significant bivariate correlations between
                        population density and both aridity and precipitation (Table 5), indicating
                        higher population densities with higher precipitation and lower aridity.
                        However, when performing the bivariate regressions for each climate zone
                        individually, the only significant correlations are in the cold region, for
                        the parameters precipitation and temperature (Table 5). Similar results were found when
                        performing multivariate regressions using two parameters. At the global
                        scale, all combinations of parameters are significant, but within climatic
                        regions significant regressions were mainly found in the cold region. The
                        only exception is the combination of dwland and
                        precipitation, which resulted in a significant regression in arid zones. Performing regression analyses using three parameters resulted in more
                        interesting results. In the arid zone, adding
                            dwland to both precipitation &
                        temperature and to aridity & temperature resulted in significant
                        correlation, whereas there was no significant correlation between population
                        density and the latter pairs of variables without
                            dwland. This indicates that population
                        densities in arid zones are influenced by a combination of distance to
                        freshwater bodies and precipitation/aridity. We also divided the arid zone
                        into five geographical regions (see Supporting Information S2) and performed
                        the same regression analyses as presented above, in order to find possible
                        regional differences within the arid zone. We found that the correlations
                        between dwland and population density are
                        strongest in Northern Africa and Middle and Southern Africa (see all the
                        results in Supporting Information S2). Overall, it seems that in the tropical and temperate zones the concentration
                        of populations cannot be explained by either climatic factors or the
                        distance to freshwater bodies. In the cold zone, climate variables play a
                        very important role, whilst in arid regions population densities can be
                        explained by a combination of climatic factors and distance to freshwater
                        bodies. We compared our results of population distance to water per FPU with
                        estimates of water availability per person (in the year 2005) from Kummu et
                        al. [17].
                            Figure 6 shows for
                        each FPU the water availability versus the median population distance to
                        water. The figure is divided into nine parts of a matrix. FPUs in the lower
                        right corner are those which suffer from both chronic water shortage and for
                        which the average distance to freshwater bodies is large. Almost all of the
                        FPUs found in this part of the matrix are located in arid climate zones.
                        However, not every arid FPU with a long distance to water suffers from water
                        shortage, as can be seen from the points in the upper right corner. In
                        contrast, there are also FPUs that suffer from chronic water shortage whilst
                        having a relatively low population distance to water. These are in the lower
                        left corner and are mainly areas with high population density in parts of
                        Europe, East Asia, and South Asia (see Supporting
                            Information S2).  Analysis scale is the FPU level. Total population in the
                                matrix's nine areas is presented in the top right corner of the
                                plot, the percentage of the world's total population is in
                                brackets. The lines represent population distributions for the
                                distance to water (lower x-axis, right y-axis) and for water
                                availability (left y-axis and upper x-axis). These lines represent
                                where large concentrations of people are present. Note: the left and
                                lower axes have a logarithmic scale. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020578.g006 A long distance to freshwater might be an extra stress factor on top of
                        physical water shortage for populations living in such areas. Around
                        70% of the population under chronic water shortage (<1000
                            m3/capita/yr) lives in areas relatively close to water
                        (<3.0 km), while 260 million people live in areas relatively far from
                        water (>6 km), mostly in the arid zones of Middle East and Northern
                        Africa (Figure 6).
                        Approximately 20% of the global population lives in areas under some
                        kind of water shortage (<1700 m3/capita/yr) and further than
                        3.0 km (global median) from the nearest freshwater body. We found clear regional differences in the distance to which human populations
                    live from water, with people living closest to water in high northern latitudes
                    and parts of the tropics, due to the abundance of many rivers and lakes.
                    Interestingly, whilst the population distance to water is generally highest in
                    arid regions, the relative distance to water (i.e.
                        dwrpop/land) is
                    lowest in these regions. There are also large differences between the different types of population groups
                    (urban, peri-urban, and rural). Our results clearly show that, on a global
                    scale, population density is not greatly affected by
                        dwland in urban and peri-urban areas, whilst in
                    rural areas there is a clear decrease in population density as the
                            dwland to freshwater increases (see Figure 2). These global
                    findings mask important differences between regions. We have shown that in most
                    regions, the dwpop for urban populations tends to be
                    rather similar to the dwpop for rural populations.
                    However, interesting differences are found in the Middle East and North Africa,
                    where urban populations live significantly closer to water than rural
                    populations, and in the Americas, where urban populations live further from
                    water than rural populations. This could be related to the fact that large
                    cities of the Americas developed much later than many of the major cities in the
                    old world, by which time means of transporting water from source to consumption
                    point were more advanced. The most distinct difference in median dwpop between
                    population classes can be seen for North Africa, where the
                            dwpop in rural areas is more than the double
                    that in urban and peri-urban areas (Figure 4). This may be because in this (mainly) arid region, water
                    bodies are more limited, thus increasing their attractiveness for human
                    settlement, and resulting in urban areas close to them. In addition, the region
                    contains many ancient cities where proximity to fresh water was essential for
                    the founding of large settlements. Also, in the present day the GDP of many
                    countries in this region is relatively low [12], meaning that high costs of
                    water transport may make it financially prohibitive to locate cities far from
                    freshwater bodies. On the other hand, rural populations in this region appear to
                    live relatively far from freshwater bodies; this could have several causes. For
                    example, in response to the arid conditions of the region, agricultural
                    practices may have evolved to be able to make use of rainwater harvesting
                    techniques and ground- or soil-water sources. Moreover, there are large numbers
                    of ephemeral streams and wetlands in the region, which may be essential for
                    rural communities. However, ephemeral water bodies and ground- or soil-water
                    sources are not included in our analysis. Global studies on climate adaptation and development can benefit from an improved
                    understanding of the relationship between human populations and the distance to
                    freshwater. For example, global estimates of the costs of adapting to climate
                    change in the water supply sector [9], [40] have so far used decision rules on preferred
                    adaptation options based on water availability and cost. However, such rules
                    could be improved by incorporating spatial patterns of the distance of human
                    populations from water. For example, in regions where people live far from
                    surface water bodies, adaptation based on water transport may become
                    prohibitively expensive, and groundwater use or rainwater harvesting may be more
                    effective and/or efficient. In this study, we have shown that populations in arid zones tend to live the
                    furthest from freshwater bodies in absolute terms. On average, people in
                    Northern Africa and the Middle East live furthest from water, and this is
                    especially the case for rural populations in North Africa. Hence, when
                    estimating global adaptation requirements and costs one must consider that
                    long-distance transport of water from reservoirs may not be feasible in the
                    latter. Also, between similar regions, the ability to adapt is related to
                    financial means; in more affluent arid regions those means may be more readily
                    available for implementing such systems, whilst in less-affluent regions a focus
                    on smaller scale activities such as rainwater harvesting may be
                    preferential. Our results also show large regional differences in distance to water between
                    urban and rural populations. Again, this is important to consider in planning
                    integrated water management and adaptation measures as water requirements differ
                    between urban and rural areas; globally aggregated estimates may mask these
                    important differences. Several studies have also shown that in many parts of the world, river runoffs,
                    and thus water availability, are significantly related to different forms of
                    interannual climate variability [41]–[43]. This should
                    also be considered when designing measures for water supply; especially those
                    people directly dependent on a distant freshwater body can be severely impacted
                    if water availability is decreased in a given year (or several years) due to
                    such variability. With our analysis, we hoped to provide additional information related to
                    ‘access to safe drinking water’, which is one of the assessment
                    measures used by WHO (World Health Organisation). The definition of WHO changed,
                    however, after year 2000 from ‘access to clean water’ to
                    ‘access to improved drinking-water source’ [44]. Thus, rivers and streams
                    are excluded from the new definition. We do believe, however, that rivers and
                    streams are important in many ways for those 13% of the global population
                    without access to improved drinking-water sources [8], and also to people who obtain
                    their drinking water from secured sources but do use unimproved water sources
                    for activities such as the washing of laundry. Thus, our results and methodology
                    could be useful for further analysing the situation of populations in countries
                    with poor access to water. Our results also identify regions where extra
                    attention may already be needed to supply water given the physical shortage and
                    relatively long distance to surface freshwater sources. The limitations of this study, discussed in the materials and methods section,
                    give a pathway for future research needs in distance to water calculations. The inclusion of small streams, local surface waters, springs, ground water
                    sources, and ephemeral water bodies (including wetlands) in the calculations
                    could better reflect the relationships between populations and fresh water,
                    particularly in rural areas. In the present study, those water sources were
                    excluded from the analysis due to poor data availability, but they should be
                    included in future global analyses as soon as appropriate global datasets become
                    available. Water quality is also an important factor in the relationship between population
                    and water. Poor water quality may decrease the usefulness of water, even if
                    water would be at a close proximity, for example in many densely populated or
                    industrialised areas. A global dataset of water quality could allow us to
                    exclude polluted freshwater bodies from the analysis. In this study we were not aiming to separate cultural or economic factors from
                    physical factors when analysing distance to water. Naturally, in some parts of
                    the world the distance to water is much more crucial for survival in everyday
                    life, while elsewhere it may have a more aesthetic, cultural, or recreational
                    value. More detailed analysis of these different ‘values’ of water
                    would be an interesting addition to the work presented here. Furthermore, rapid
                    population (and economic) growth and urbanisation have probably changed the
                    relationship between water and human populations. Thus, an historical analysis
                    of how the distance to water has evolved could reveal interesting regional
                    trends. The limitations of the study, discussed in this section and in Section 2 (Materials and Methods), should be taken into
                    account when interpreting the results. We highly recommend limiting the use of
                    the results to the macro-scale (i.e. regional to global). In this study we assessed the distance between human populations and surface
                    freshwater bodies on a global scale. We aimed to increase the understanding of
                    how inhabited places relate to surface freshwater bodies in different climate
                    zones and administrative regions. Even though the population distance to water
                    shows large variations for a variety of reasons, some general conclusions can be
                    drawn from our results: Since population distance to water is a very basic element of human societies, it
                    is of interest to both the general public as well as the scientific community
                    dealing with natural resources management and climate change. Global studies on
                    development and climate adaptation can particularly benefit from an improved
                    understanding of the relationships between human populations and the distance to
                    fresh water. For example, in regions where the population lives far from water
                    bodies, adaptation based on water transport may become prohibitively expensive
                    and unsustainable, and groundwater use and rainwater harvesting may be more
                    effective and/or efficient. Our results also identify regions where extra
                    attention may be needed to water supply in the near-term, i.e. those regions
                    where populations live relatively far from freshwater bodies and also already
                    suffer from water shortage. Supplement for Materials and methods section. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0020578.s001 (PDF) Supplement for Results section. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0020578.s002 (PDF) We thank our colleagues, particularly Marko Keskinen, at Water & Development
