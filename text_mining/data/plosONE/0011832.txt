   Deep-sea ecosystems represent the largest biome of the global biosphere, but
                    knowledge of their biodiversity is still scant. The Mediterranean basin has been
                    proposed as a hot spot of terrestrial and coastal marine biodiversity but has
                    been supposed to be impoverished of deep-sea species richness. We summarized all
                    available information on benthic biodiversity (Prokaryotes, Foraminifera,
                    Meiofauna, Macrofauna, and Megafauna) in different deep-sea ecosystems of the
                    Mediterranean Sea (200 to more than 4,000 m depth), including open slopes, deep
                    basins, canyons, cold seeps, seamounts, deep-water corals and deep-hypersaline
                    anoxic basins and analyzed overall longitudinal and bathymetric patterns. We
                    show that in contrast to what was expected from the sharp decrease in organic
                    carbon fluxes and reduced faunal abundance, the deep-sea biodiversity of both
                    the eastern and the western basins of the Mediterranean Sea is similarly high.
                    All of the biodiversity components, except Bacteria and Archaea, displayed a
                    decreasing pattern with increasing water depth, but to a different extent for
                    each component. Unlike patterns observed for faunal abundance, highest negative
                    values of the slopes of the biodiversity patterns were observed for Meiofauna,
                    followed by Macrofauna and Megafauna. Comparison of the biodiversity associated
                    with open slopes, deep basins, canyons, and deep-water corals showed that the
                    deep basins were the least diverse. Rarefaction curves allowed us to estimate
                    the expected number of species for each benthic component in different
                    bathymetric ranges. A large fraction of exclusive species was associated with
                    each specific habitat or ecosystem. Thus, each deep-sea ecosystem contributes
                    significantly to overall biodiversity. From theoretical extrapolations we
                    estimate that the overall deep-sea Mediterranean biodiversity (excluding
                    prokaryotes) reaches approximately 2805 species of which about 66% is
                    still undiscovered. Among the biotic components investigated (Prokaryotes
                    excluded), most of the unknown species are within the phylum Nematoda, followed
                    by Foraminifera, but an important fraction of macrofaunal and megafaunal species
                    also remains unknown. Data reported here provide new insights into the patterns
                    of biodiversity in the deep-sea Mediterranean and new clues for future
                    investigations aimed at identifying the factors controlling and threatening
                    deep-sea biodiversity. Citation: Danovaro R, Company JB, Corinaldesi C, D'Onghia G, Galil B, Gambi C, et al.  (2010) Deep-Sea Biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea: The Known, the Unknown, and the Unknowable. PLoS ONE 5(8):

                depth. They represent the world's largest biome, covering more than
                65% of the earth's surface and including more than
                95% of the global biosphere. Despite their huge dimensions, our knowledge
                of both pelagic and benthic deep-sea diversity is scant [1], [2]. In the last decades,
                an increasing number of studies have been conducted to investigate deep-sea
                biodiversity in several regions of the world, including the Atlantic and
                mid-Atlantic ocean [3], [4], the Arabian Sea [3], [5]–[9], and the
                equatorial, tropical, and subtropical Pacific. But these studies focus on a limited
                number of taxa and are typically characterized by a limited spatial or temporal
                scale of investigation [7], [8], [10]–[12]. Traditionally the
                Mediterranean Sea is one of the most intensively investigated areas of the world in
                both terrestrial and coastal marine biodiversity, but it lags other regions of the
                world in studies of its deep-sea fauna. The Mediterranean Sea is divided into western and central-eastern basins, which are
                separated by the Strait of Sicily. The western basin (mean depth, about 1,600 m)
                consists of two deep basins: the Algero Provençal basin and the
                Tyrrhenian Sea. The central-eastern Mediterranean consists of three main deep
                basins: the Ionian, Aegean, and Levantine [13]. The deepest point in the
                Mediterranean, 5,121 m, is found at the North Matapan-Vavilov Trench, Ionian Sea
                    [14].
                The deep-sea floor includes regions characterized by complex sedimentological and
                structural features: (a) continental slopes, (b) submarine canyons, (c)
                base-of-slope deposits, and (d) bathyal or basin plains with abundant deposits of
                hemipelagic and turbidity muds. Sedimentological and stratigraphic features that
                contribute to the complexity of the deep-sea basin include (a) effects of the
                Messinian salinity crisis, with the creation of deep-hypersaline anoxic basins, (b)
                cold seepage and “mud volcanism” associated with the release of
                gas from deep-sea sediments, (c) the role of catastrophic events (e.g., landslides),
                which increase considerably the topographic complexity of the seafloor, and (d)
                volcanism and its influence on the topographic features and the creation of
                seamounts. Water circulation is highly complex. The surface waters come from the
                Atlantic and turn into intermediate waters in the Eastern Mediterranean.
                Low-salinity Atlantic waters enter the Mediterranean, while denser
                deep-Mediterranean waters flow beneath the Atlantic waters in the opposite direction
                into the Atlantic Ocean. Mesoscale variability is extremely evident in the
                Mediterranean and is responsible for the creation of small gyres (eddies) that have
                implications for the primary productivity and the flux of organic matter settling to
                the seafloor. Deep and bottom currents are largely unexplored, but episodic
                intensification of current speed up to 1 m s−1 has been
                documented [15]. During late spring and summer, the whole Western
                Mediterranean is strongly stratified, the seasonal thermocline being 20–50
                m deep. In winter, the water column is more homogeneous, especially in the open sea.
                High oxygen concentrations are present across the water column down to the seafloor
                    [16]. The main hydrological features of the deep Mediterranean Sea are (a) high homeothermy
                from roughly 300–500 m to the bottom, and bottom temperatures of about
                12.8°C to 13.5°C in the western basin and 13.5°C to
                15.5°C in the eastern basin (i.e., there are no thermal boundaries, whereas
                in the Atlantic Ocean the temperature decreases with depth) [17], (b) high salinity, from
                about 38 to 39.5 by the stratification of the water column, (c) limited freshwater
                inputs (the freshwater deficit is equivalent to about 0.5–0.9 m
                    y−1, compensated by the Atlantic inflow of surface water),
                (d) a microtidal regime, (e) high oxygen concentrations, and (f) oligotrophic
                conditions, with strong energetic gradients and low nutrient concentrations in the
                eastern basin [18]. The eastern basin is considered to be one of the
                most oligotrophic areas of the world [19], [20] (see Text S1 for a
                full list of references). Inputs of organic carbon are 15–80 times lower
                than in the western basin and there are extremely low concentrations of
                chlorophyll-a in surface offshore waters (about 0.05 µg
                    L−1) [21], [22]. In addition, there are low concentrations of the
                potentially limiting organic nutrients (e.g., proteins and lipids) that sharply
                decline with increasing distance from the coast and depth within the sediment. The
                average depth of the Mediterranean basin is about 1,450 m, much shallower than the
                average depth of the world oceans (about 3,850 m). This has several implications for
                the deep-water turnover (roughly 50 years) and the vulnerability to climate change
                and deep-water warming. The Mediterranean Sea has been considered a
                “miniature ocean” that can be used as a model to anticipate the
                response of the global oceans to various kinds of pressures. The Mediterranean basin is a hot spot of biodiversity with a uniquely high percentage
                of endemic species [23]. Despite its small dimensions (0.82%
                of the ocean surface), the basin hosts more than 7.5% of global
                biodiversity [24]. However, this information is almost completely
                confined to coastal ecosystems, and data on deep-sea assemblages are still limited
                    [25]–[27]. This is unfortunate, as
                pioneer investigations of macrobenthos were conducted in the deep Cretan Sea (see
                    Text S1
                for a full list of references). While dredging in the Aegean Sea, Forbes noticed
                that sediments became progressively more impoverished in biodiversity with
                increasing sampling depth, and Forbes proposed the azoic hypothesis [28],
                namely, that life would be extinguished altogether by 500 m depth [29]. The
                Forbes hypothesis was accepted as fact, despite indisputable evidence of the
                presence of deep-sea life from the Gulf of Genoa [30] (see Text S1 for a
                complete list of references) and at depths down to 1,000 m [31]. Benthic and
                benthopelagic deep-sea fauna in the Mediterranean (Tyrrhenian Sea) were provided by
                the Washington expedition (1881–83) with trawls carried
                out down to 3,115 m depths (see Text S1 for a complete list of references). After
                this exploration, knowledge of Mediterranean deep-sea fauna was mainly provided by
                the Hirondelle and Princesse Alice expeditions
                (1888–1922), the ichthyological results of which were reported by Zugmayer
                    [32]
                (see Text S1
                for a complete list of references). The most extensive deep-sea faunistic
                exploration in the Levant basin of the Mediterranean occurred during the voyages of
                the Pola (1890–93). The Danish oceanographic cruises of
                the Thor (1908) and Dana (1928–29) also
                reported deep-sea fish at depths greater than 1,000 m in the Mediterranean (see
                    Text S1
                for a complete list of references). After the Danish oceanographic expeditions, the
                first noteworthy sampling of deep-sea fish in the Mediterranean was during the
                Polymède campaign made with the RV Jean Charcot
                [33]
                in the western basin and the German Meteor expedition in the
                eastern basin [34]. During the second half of the twentieth century,
                little deep-sea sampling was conducted in the deep Mediterranean, providing
                scattered information on Macrofauna [35]–[37] (see Text S1 for a
                complete list of references). However, from the late 1980s, when specific projects
                were designed for systematic investigation of the deep sea below 1,000 m depth,
                several deep-sea benthic studies have been conducted in the Mediterranean Sea [13], [20],
                    [38]–[49], including the deep
                Levantine Sea [50]–[53]. In this latter period,
                deep-sea trawls (Agassiz drags and otter trawls) and bottom long-lines were used
                    [54]
                (see Text S1
                for a complete list of references), allowing the collection of several megafaunal
                species, including four deep-water shark species at depths of 1,330–1,440
                m [55].
                The first investigations on deep-sea Meiofauna started in the Western Mediterranean
                and subsequently expanded to the entire basin [18], [56]–[68]. In 2001, a
                multidisciplinary trans-Mediterranean cruise investigated bathyal and abyssal
                (600–4,000 m) fauna, providing pioneer data on the distribution, biology,
                and ecology of Meio-, Macro-, and Megafauna [46]. Only Gilat and Gelman
                    [69],
                Priede and Bagley [70], and Galil [53] made use of photographic
                equipment to observe the deep fauna in the Levantine basin. The biodiversity of
                fauna associated with hot spot ecosystems, such as seamounts, cold seeps, and deep
                corals, has been investigated only in the last two decades [71]–[75] (see
                    Text S1
                for additional references). Studies of deep-sea benthic Foraminifera in the Mediterranean started in the late
                1950s in both the western and eastern basins and extended in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s
                    [76]–[79] (see Text S1 for
                additional references) down to 4,523 m depth. The following are among the more
                important studies in the deep Western Mediterranean. Parisi [80] worked on samples from
                bathyal depths (1,003–3,593 m) in the Tyrrhenian Sea and Straits of
                Sicily. Bizon and Bizon [81] reported on the geographic and bathymetric
                distribution of species down to 2,000 m off Marseille, Corsica, and in the Ligurian
                Sea. Schmiedl et al. [82], Heinz et al. [83], and Fontanier et al.
                    [84] analyzed samples from the Gulf of Lions slope
                (343–1,987 m) and one site located at 920 m in the Lacaze-Duthier Canyon.
                Three studies have analyzed samples from the Eastern and Western Mediterranean; Cita
                and Zocchi [85] in the Alboran, Balearic, Tyrrhenian, Ionian, and
                Levantine basins (166–4,625 m); De Rijk et al. [86], [87] along bathymetric
                transects (20–4,000 m) from the same basins and the Tyrrhenian Basin and
                Straits of Sicily; and Pancotti (unpublished) from the Balearic Basin, Tyrrhenian
                Sea, Ionian Sea, and areas around Crete and Rhodes. The large number (hundreds) of
                samples studied, and the variation in their surface area, make it difficult to
                estimate the total area sampled. The study of the diversity of benthic prokaryotic assemblages (Bacteria and Archaea)
                in deep-sea sediments of the Mediterranean Sea began only after 2000 [88], [89],
                when the development of molecular genetic tools [90] overcame the inability
                to culture the large majority of deep-sea prokaryotes on conventional culture media
                    [91]–[93]. These tools have freed
                researchers from culturing biases (less than 1% of environmental microbes
                can be cultivated) and allowed characterization of community structure (e.g., 16S
                and 18S ribosomal RNA genes for prokaryotes and microeukaryotes, respectively) [90], [94].
                Since then the number of sites explored and the number of samples analyzed have
                increased enormously, although most of the data are still being processed. In this paper, we summarize the currently available information on deep Mediterranean
                biodiversity by examining and comparing the different components of the deep-sea
                biota, from Prokaryotes to Unicellular Eukaryotes, Meiofauna, Macrofauna, and
                Megafauna (including benthopelagic components). We performed an in-depth analysis of
                the main types of deep-sea ecosystems, including (a) open slopes, (b) deep canyons,
                (c) deep basins, (d) deep-water coral ecosystems, (e) hydrothermal vents, (f) cold
                seeps, and (g) deep anoxic basins. Figure 1 shows the areas where deep-sea samples and data have been
                collected for use in this paper.  Areas include slopes, seamounts, canyons, deep-water corals, and basin. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011832.g001 Little is known about the biodiversity of benthic prokaryotes in the deep sea.
                    This is particularly true in the Mediterranean Sea, where only limited and
                    sparse studies have been carried out in “spot” locations in
                    the Eastern Mediterranean, Cretan Sea, and South Ionian, [95]; southern
                    Cretan margin [96] and the Ionian [88] and Tyrrhenian [97]
                    seas (Table
                        S1 and Text S2). The amounts of sediment that have
                    been analyzed for bacterial and archaeal diversity in the deep Mediterranean Sea
                    are on the order of a few tens of grams, clearly indicating that studies are
                    just beginning (Figures 2
                    and 3). Available
                    information on bacterial OTUs (operational taxonomic units) richness in the
                    Mediterranean Sea highlights a high level of diversity ranging from 13 to 1,306
                    OTUs per gram of surface sediment, depending on the method used (fingerprinting
                    or cloning/sequencing) [88], [89], [96]. These estimates do not include the
                    “rare” taxa, which can be detected only by the powerful 454
                    pyro-sequencing technology. This technique, which has not been applied yet in
                    deep-sea sediments of the Mediterranean Sea, is likely to increase significantly
                    the estimates of bacterial species richness. Mediterranean sediments are highly
                    diverse, displaying a bacterial richness comparable with deep Antarctic
                    sediments [98] as well as with other deep-sea sediments
                        [91],
                        [92].
                    A comparative analysis of bacterial diversity from different oceanic regions
                    highlights the peculiarity of the Mediterranean: the turnover diversity between
                    Mediterranean and Atlantic sediments is about 85%, and reaches
                    97% between the Mediterranean and the South Pacific.  Diversity is estimated as (a) bacterial and archaeal OTU richness (data
                            obtained using ARISA and 16S rDNA T-RFLP fingerprinting technique,
                            respectively, are unpublished); (b) Species Richness and (c) Expected

                            ES(100) are from [26]. Reported are average values and

              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011832.g003 Our knowledge of benthic Archaea in the deep Mediterranean Sea is almost
                    nonexistent. Recently, Mediterranean-specific archaeal
                    “ecotypes” were identified in bathypelagic waters [99],
                    while fingerprinting analyses to determine benthic archaeal OTU richness
                    reported a diversity roughly 10 times lower than that for Bacteria (range
                    3–35 OTUs per gram of sediment; [100]). As in the case of
                    bacterial assemblages, the composition of Mediterranean archaeal assemblages is
                    significantly different from that of deep Atlantic sediments [100].
                    Interestingly, significant longitudinal differences could be observed between
                    the Western, Central, and Eastern Mediterranean, with a turnover diversity
                    reaching 99%, indicating high regional variability [95]. On the other hand, no bathymetric patterns
                    of prokaryotic diversity have been observed in the Mediterranean sediments for
                    either Bacteria or Archaea. The construction of 16S rDNA clone libraries [91], [92], [101]
                    has revealed that Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Delta-Proteobacteria,
                    Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes are widely distributed in most
                    marine environments, while Alpha-Proteobacteria, Gamma-Proteobacteria, and
                    Bacteroidetes appear to be common in deep-sea sediments [91], [92], [101], [102]. A
                    phylogenetic analysis conducted on 207 bacterial 16S rDNA sequences from a large
                    clone library in the South Ionian Sea at a depth of 2,790 m demonstrated that
                    Acidobacteria was the dominant phylogenetic group, followed by
                    Gamma-Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Delta-Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes
                        [89], [95]. A few clones
                    grouped with the Alpha-Proteobacteria, Beta-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria,
                    Verrucomicrobia, Chloroflexi, Nitrospirae, and Bacteroidetes. Recently, a total
                    of 454 sequenced clones from the deep southern Cretan margin revealed the
                    dominance of the phyla Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, Gamma-,
                    Alpha-, and Delta- Proteobacteria, and only few sequences were affiliated with
                    the phyla Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes,
                    Verrucomicrobia, Nitrospirae, Beta-Proteobacteria, Lentisphaerae, and
                    Dictyoglomi [96]. However, in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea,
                    the phylum Acidobacteria dominated the microbial communities in the deep-sea
                    sediments, followed by members of the Gamma- and Delta-Proteobacteria [95], [96]. Generally the
                    presence of Acidobacteria phylum members has been associated with
                    metal-contaminated, acidic sediments, or extreme conditions [103] and
                    their presence in the deep Mediterranean and in pristine sediments remains
                    questionable. In addition to the dominance of Acidobacteria, the phylotypes that
                    have been identified from the Mediterranean sediment clone libraries were only
                    distantly related to sequences included in the public databases (i.e., GenBank,
                        [96]) whereas a large fraction of the retrieved
                    sequences (12%) did not fall into any taxonomic division previously
                    identified. These findings are consistent with data available from Mediterranean
                    deep waters [104]. The still-limited available evidence
                    indicates that deep Mediterranean sediments harbor an incredibly high and unique
                    prokaryotic diversity, which is different from that described in other deep
                    benthic environments. Mediterranean sediments can be considered as
                    “bacterial hot spots.” The preservation of this biodiversity
                    is enormously important for the ecological functioning of the entire
                    Mediterranean basin, as well as, from a bioprospecting point of view, for
                    potential future exploitation and sustainable use of deep Mediterranean
                    resources. Foraminiferal species richness and other diversity measures, as well as
                    abundance, are reported to be lower in the Eastern than in the Central and
                    Western Mediterranean, the lowest values being found in the deep Levantine Basin
                        [85], [86] (Figure 2, Table S2 and Text S2).
                    Rarefaction curves (Pancotti unpublished) generally show decreasing species
                    richness from west to east, with highest values in the western part of the
                    Balearic Basin (2,650–2,688 m) and lowest values in the Rhodes Basin
                    (3,020 m) and in the south of Crete (2,090 m). Only three specimens representing
                    a single species (a saccamminid) were recorded in the Ionian Basin (3,903 m).
                    This east-to-west decline in species richness is probably related to the
                    corresponding decrease in organic matter flux settling the seafloor [87]. In
                    the Eastern Mediterranean, Cita and Zocchi [85] report a decrease in
                    species richness from 11–64 at 1,000–1,800 m to
                    4–8 at 1,800–2,500 m and less than 8 at
                    2,500–4,000 m. This compares with 65–92
                    (1,311–1,867 m) and 19–71 (2,318–2,703 m) in the
                    Western Mediterranean (Balearic Basin). Based on box core samples collected
                    along bathymetric transects spanning the length of the Mediterranean, De Rijk
                    and coworkers [86] reported a broad peak in species richness
                    between 200 m and 1,000 m, below which richness decreased to 4,000 m, the
                    maximum depth sampled. When the bathymetric distributions of individual species
                    are considered (Figure 3),
                    the upper and lower depth limits are usually found to be shallower in the more
                    oligotrophic eastern basins than in the more eutrophic western basins [87].
                    Despite the differences in size fractions analyzed, when taken together, these
                    data reveal a clear trend of decreasing species richness with depth,
                    particularly in the South Adriatic Sea. Similar datasets for dead assemblages
                    are available from studies in the Tyrrenian Sea and Sicily Channel
                    (1,000–3,600 m, >63 µm fraction) [80] and
                    in the Adriatic Sea (207–1,198 m, >150 µm) [78]. Nematodes are the dominant meiofaunal taxon (on average more than 80%
                    of entire Meiofauna) and their Species Richness ranges from 3 to 159 species
                    (Central and Western Mediterranean Sea; Table S3 and Text S2).
                    The turnover diversity displayed high values of dissimilarity when nematode
                    assemblages were compared from different depths (maximal values of
                    84% between the bathymetric ranges 200–1,000 m and
                    3,000–4,000 m) and longitudes (greater than 77% comparing
                    Western, Central, and Eastern Mediterranean). This high variability in species
                    composition is confirmed by the significant difference between nematode
                    assemblages from different depths and longitudes (significance level less than
                    0.001). Nematode biodiversity displays a clear longitudinal gradient along open
                    slopes, with values decreasing from west to east (Figure 2). At all longitudes, nematode
                    Species Richness displays a high variability. It has been suggested that the
                    longitudinal gradient could result from a decrease in productivity, and hence in
                    food availability, in a west-to-east direction [18], [62].
                    These findings suggest that the spatial variability of food quality along the
                    deep Mediterranean Sea influences the large-scale spatial patterns of
                    biodiversity. This is consistent with a comparison of nematode diversity in the
                    north and south Aegean Sea, where the contrasting surface primary production
                    supports the hypothesis of a link between diversity and productivity [68]. These results suggest that organic inputs
                    from the euphotic zone can have an important influence on nematode diversity.
                    However, further analyses conducted at about 3,000 m depth revealed that
                    nematode diversity was not associated with changing food availability or with
                    organic input to the seafloor [61]. Diversity indexes may be strongly influenced
                    by the local ecology of an area [7], [105],
                        [106], and west–east differences in the
                    deep-sea biodiversity could be also related to a different evolutionary history,
                    related to the Messinian crisis. Unfortunately, there is not sufficient
                    information available to clarify whether the observed nematode diversity
                    patterns are also reflected by other taxa. Analysis of the bathymetric patterns
                    of nematode diversity reveals the lack of unimodal patterns and no evidence for
                    a decline with increasing water depth in the western basin; instead, Species
                    Richness displays a high variability at all depths (Figure 3). Conversely, in the Eastern
                    Mediterranean, nematode diversity increased from the continental shelf down to
                    the bathyal zone (deeper than 1,000 m), where the highest diversity was found,
                    and then decreased again down to depths greater than 2,000 m. This hump-shape
                    pattern needs to be confirmed with the analysis of a larger dataset. Despite the thorough review of Fredj and Laubier [107] regarding
                    qualitative aspects of the benthic Macrofauna composition of the deep
                    Mediterranean Sea, quantitative data from this basin are scarce (Figures 2 and 3, Table S4
                    and Text
                        S2). Several investigations have described low-abundance and
                    low-diversity conditions of marine invertebrates in the Eastern Mediterranean
                        [35],
                        [38], [43], [107]–[109]. The Gibraltar
                    sill is, potentially, a physical barrier for the colonization of Mediterranean
                    habitats by larvae and deep-sea benthic organisms from the richer Atlantic
                    fauna, which could explain the low diversity observed for deep Mediterranean
                    Macrofauna. Van Harten [110] hypothesized that several species of
                    deep-water ostracods that are still common in the Western Mediterranean became
                    extinct in the Eastern Mediterranean basin at the onset of early Holocene S1
                    sapropel deposition, which still make the bathyal bottoms unfavorable to faunal
                    colonization (see Text S1 for more references). These results,
                    however, were not confirmed by subsequent studies aimed at investigating the
                    distribution of biodiversity across the Atlantic-Mediterranean region.
                    Macpherson [111] and Galil [53] suggest that within
                    the Atlantic-Mediterranean region, the fauna (including invertebrates and
                    fishes) of the Mediterranean Sea is more diverse than that of the Atlantic and
                    displays considerable endemism. In addition, except for strictly deep-dwelling
                    species (e.g., the deep-water decapod crustacean family Polychelida), the
                    Gibraltar sill is not an impenetrable barrier for some deeper-water macrobenthic
                    species [112]. It has been hypothesized also that as a
                    result of high deep-sea temperatures (about 10°C higher than in the
                    Atlantic Ocean at the same depth), much of the present-day Mediterranean
                    deep-sea fauna consists of reproductively sterile pseudopopulations that are
                    constantly replenished through larval inflow [113]. However,
                    populations of the most common benthic mollusk species at depths greater than
                    1,000 m in the Levantine Sea comprise both adult and juvenile specimens. Gravid
                    benthic decapod crustaceans and fish have been collected repeatedly from the
                    deep Levantine Sea [50], [52], [114]
                    and Western and Central Mediterranean [115]–[127]. In the Catalan Sea (northwestern Mediterranean), 48 species of fishes have been
                    collected between 400 m and 1,500 m, and among the most abundant are
                        Alepocephalus rostratus and Mora moro
                    [26] and Fernandez de Arcaya (unpublished data).
                    Though much reduced in diversity and richness compared with the deep-sea fauna
                    of the western and central basins of the Mediterranean, the Levantine
                    bathybenthos appears to be composed of autochthonous, self-sustaining
                    populations of opportunistic, eurybathic species that have settled there since
                    the last sapropelic event. Working in the Cretan Sea, Tselepides and coworkers
                        [20] reported mean benthic biomass, abundance, and
                    diversity to decrease drastically with depth, and the occurrence of major faunal
                    transitions at 200 m, 500 m, and 1,000 m depth. Although the deep Mediterranean
                    is generally considered to be a “biological desert,” a
                    moderate number of megabenthic species have been reported [26], [108],
                        [123], [128], [129] even from the most oligotrophic regions of
                    the Mediterranean, such as the Levantine Sea [53], [130] at
                    depths between 400 m and 4,264 m. In the eastern basin, 20 species of decapod
                    crustaceans have been encountered, including the endemic geryonid crab
                        (Chaceon mediterraneus), which was photographed southwest
                    of Cyprus at 2,900 m. One species, Levantocaris hornungae, was
                    described as new to science [50], [131].
                        Polycheles typhlops, Acanthephyra eximia,
                        Aristeus antennatus, and Geryon longipes
                    were the most common species, comprising nearly 48%, 25%,
                    14%, and 7% of the specimens, respectively. The same species are also dominant in the Cretan Sea and the Rhodos and Ierapetra
                    basins. Among amphipod crustaceans, off Cyprus and Israel a total of 22 species
                    (from 673 specimens collected) were encountered, and four of these were endemic
                    to the Mediterranean. Two of these, Ileraustroe ilergetes and
                        Pseudotiron bouvieri, represented 40% and
                    15% of the amphipod specimens, respectively. Rhachotropis rostrata and Stegophaloides christianiensis were
                    the next most common, representing nearly 11% of the specimens. From
                    the baited trap deployments in the Cretan Sea and the Rhodos and Ierapetra
                    basins, Scopelocheirus hopei, Scopelocheirus
                        polymedus, Orchmenella nana, Orchomene
                        grimaldi, and Epimeria cf. cornigera were the most
                    abundant amphipod species. Twelve species of cumaceans from a total of 575
                    specimens were collected: Procampylaspis bonnieri was the most
                    frequently collected, representing 33% of the specimens, followed by
                        Campylaspis glabra (13%) and
                        Makrokylindrus longipes, Platysympus typicus, and Procampylaspis armata (each with
                    nearly 11%). A total of 44 species of benthic mollusks were
                    identified at depths greater than 1,000 m, the most common being Yoldia micrometrica, Kelliella abyssicola,
                        Cardyomia costellata, Entalina tetragona,
                        Benthomangelia macra, Benthonella tenella,
                    and Bathyarca pectunculoides. Studies in the western basin have
                    shown that non-crustacean invertebrates account for approximately 10%
                    to 20% of total biomass and abundance of the benthic megafauna [26], [108]. Of these,
                    mollusks and echinoderms are the groups with the highest species richness [26], [127]. The
                    proportion of echinoderms is highly reduced compared with Atlantic fauna, the
                    main species being the holothurian Molpadia musculus, the
                    echinoid Brissopsis lyrifera, and the asteroid
                        Ceramaster grenadensis
                    [26], [129]. A total of
                    31 deep-sea fish species were collected off Cyprus and Israel, including
                        Bathypterois dubius and Nezumia
                        sclerorhynchus (38% and 27% of the total fish
                    abundance, respectively). Cataetyx laticeps, Chauliodus sloani, and the ubiquitous Bathypterois dubius
                    were photographed at 2,900 m depth. In baited-camera deployments in the Cretan
                    Sea and the Rhodos and Ierapetra basins, Chalinura mediterranea
                    (now Coriphaenoides mediterraneus) and Lepidion lepidion were the most abundant species. At 1,490 m depth, the
                    sharks Centrophorus granulosus and Etmopterus spinax were the most abundant, occurring in 83% of the
                    recordings. In the Cretan Sea and Rhodos Basin and at depths less than 2,300 m,
                    the most abundant species were Hexanchus griseus,
                        Galeus melastomus, Centrophorus spp.,
                        Centroscymnus coelolepis, and Etmopterus spinax. In the deep Mediterranean Sea, information on diversity patterns and community
                    structure of benthic megafauna is still scarce. Such studies in the Western and
                    Central Mediterranean have focused on the two most abundant groups below 600 m
                    depth: fishes [44], [116], [132] and decapod crustaceans [44],
                        [124], [125], [128],
                        [133]–[136]. There is an
                    increase in the relative abundance of crustaceans relative to fish at depths
                    below 1,500 m [128]. This change in the relative abundance of
                    fish and decapod crustaceans has been explained by the low food availability at
                    greater depths and the higher adaptation of crustaceans to low energy levels
                        [48], [128]. The diversity
                    patterns of the much less abundant noncrustacean benthic megafauna are virtually
                    unstudied, with the exception of a few descriptive studies [107], [137],
                        [138] and scarce quantitative data [26], [108], [129]. Fishes and crustaceans are mainly
                    responsible for a megafaunal peak between 1,100 m and 1,300 m [13],
                        [46], [116], [128],
                        [132], [139], [140]
                    that is related to high suprabenthos abundance between 800 m and 1,200 m on the
                    slope [115], [141]. These high
                    biomass levels have been attributed, in the Western Mediterranean, to the fishes
                        Alepocephalus rostratus, Trachyrinchus
                        scabrus, Mora moro, and Lepidion lepidion, and the crab Geryon longipes
                    [48],
                        [49]. Depth-related patterns of fish biomass and
                    biodiversity have been reported by several authors, but with different zonations
                        [116], [132], [142],
                        [143]. Larger species are found between 600 m and
                    1,200 m depth (“bigger-deeper”), followed by a rapid
                    decrease with increasing depth [49], [139], [141], [143], [144]. Megafaunal species richness decreases with depth between 600 m and 4,000 m both
                    in the western and eastern Mediterranean basin [47], [48],
                        [108], [123]. Biodiversity
                    (H′) also decreases from 800 m and drops significantly below 1,500 m
                    depth, while evenness increases [108], [116],
                        [129]. Recent studies extend depth ranges in the
                    Levantine Sea deeper than in the Western Mediterranean for 14 serpulid species,
                    one-third of the depth extensions were deeper than 400 m (see Text S1 for
                    more references). Twenty-three fish species were collected or photographed in
                    the Levant Sea at depths greater than in the Western Mediterranean, some nearly
                    doubling the depth record of the species [51], [52],
                        [144]. Several
                        mollusks—Pteroctopus tetracirrhus, Crenilabium exile,
                        Yoldiella philippiana, Bathyarca philippiana, Thyasira granulosa, Allogramma formosa, and Cuspidaria rostrata—have been collected from
                    greater depths in the Levantine Sea than elsewhere in the Mediterranean [145],
                        [146]. Extension of the depth records was also
                    reported for five of the bathyal amphipods collected off the Israeli coast, and
                    for Bathymedon monoculodiformis, by as much as 1,100 m [147].
                    Species richness decreases from west to east along a longitudinal gradient in
                    the Mediterranean [108], apparently reflecting the increased
                    oligotrophy in the Levantine Basin [148], [149].
                    The Levantine Sea bathyfaunal scarcity may cause different parceling of the
                    populations that is reflected in bathymetric distributions that differ from
                    those of the Western Mediterranean deep-water assemblages. The Mediterranean basin contains, over relatively limited spatial scales, a
                    number of habitats that can represent potential “hot spots”
                    of biodiversity. Knowledge of the biodiversity associated with these habitats
                    and ecosystems is expected to enhance significantly our understanding of
                    biodiversity and functioning of the deep seas. A tentative, possibly not
                    exhaustive list of these systems includes (a) open slope systems, (b) submarine
                    canyons, (c) deep basins, (d) seamounts, (e) deep-water coral systems, (f) cold
                    seeps and carbonate mounds, (g) hydrothermal vents, and (h) permanent anoxic
                    systems. A comparison of the benthic diversity among different ecosystems is
                    reported in Figure 4. Here
                    all of the species encountered in each habitat or ecosystem for each benthic
                    component (from Foraminifera to Megafauna) are reported.  Reported are (a) Foraminifera (data on live specimens), (b) Meiofauna (as
                            Nematoda), (c) Macrofauna diversity as expected number of species for
                            100 specimens (ES(100)), and (d) Megafauna diversity as Species

              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011832.g004 The continental slope represents the connection between the shelf and basin
                        plain. The steepness of the slope allows the distinction between
                        progressive, intermediate, and abrupt continental margins [16]. Margins facing the main rivers are
                        generally progressive, with mainly fine-grained sediments. Landslides can
                        shape the seafloor and mobilize huge volumes of sediments. All the studied
                        margins show that the flux of particles increases with depth owing to the
                        presence of lateral inputs, ranging from 50% in the Gulf of Lions
                        to 80% in the Cretan Sea. Slopes are ideal systems for investigating benthic patterns: the decrease of
                        benthic abundance and biomass with increasing depth is one of the best-known
                        patterns in marine ecology. An increasing number of studies suggest that we
                        are not able to predict spatial distribution of deep-sea benthos using a
                        limited set of variables. Danovaro et al. [63] investigated
                        the biodiversity of meiofaunal (as richness of taxa) and nematode (as
                        species richness) assemblages along the continental margins at large spatial
                        scales and reported that open slopes display a species richness similar to,
                        or higher than, that reported for bathyal and abyssal plain ecosystems.
                        However, a unique, general driver capable of explaining the spatial patterns
                        of biodiversity was not identified. This result is not surprising,
                        considering the multiplicity of interactions among
                        “local” ecological characteristics, environmental
                        factors, and topographic and textural conditions in each specific slope
                        environment. This complexity probably has considerable influence on the
                        conditions, allowing settlement of a large number of species. The patterns
                        of deep-sea biodiversity along the slope are different from those
                        hypothesized so far, reflecting a mosaic of life more complex and varied
                        than previously imagined. Further efforts should be devoted to increasing
                        the spatial resolution of deep-sea investigations along open slopes.
                        Understanding the mechanisms controlling deep-sea biodiversity within and
                        across these attractive environments will open new perspectives for the
                        conservation and sustainable management of open slope systems crucial to the
                        functioning of the global ecosystem. Submarine canyons are major topographic systems that enhance the
                        heterogeneity of continental slopes [150]. These
                        submarine valleys are mostly incised on the continental slope and form part
                        of the drainage system of continental margins. Their cross sections tend to
                        be V-shaped along the upper course and U-shaped in the lower course, thus
                        reflecting the prevalence of erosion and accumulation processes,
                        respectively. Submarine canyons are widespread on many continental margins,
                        but their abundance and development vary greatly. Complex canyon networks
                        (e.g., the Gulf of Lions) are sometimes adjacent to sections of the margin
                        with only linear canyons (e.g., the Catalonia margin), or no canyons at all
                        (e.g., the North Balearic margin). Submarine canyons probably have different
                        origins, either submarine or subaerial, or both. Most canyons are relatively
                        inactive, but others are characterized by an important sediment transport
                            [151]. They are major pathways for the
                        transportation and burial of organic carbon, and fast-track corridors for
                        material transported from the land to the deep sea [152] and act as
                        temporary buffers for sediment and carbon storage. Rapid, episodic flushing
                        of canyons may at times transport large amounts of sediment to the deep
                        basin [15]. Several submarine canyons cross the
                        continental slope of the Western and Central Mediterranean. They represent
                        hot spots of species diversity and endemism [153], [154]
                        and are preferential areas for the recruitment of megafaunal species [46]. Canyons probably play an important role in structuring the populations and
                        life cycles of planktonic fauna [154], as well as
                        benthic megafauna fishery resources that are associated with them. For
                        example, canyons are important habitats for fished species, such as hake
                            (Merluccius merluccius) and for the rose shrimp
                            Aristeus antennatus
                        [16], [48], [135],
                            [144], [155], [156]. Faunal abundance and biomass are
                        usually higher inside the canyons than at similar depths in the surrounding
                        habitat, but individual size is significantly smaller than on the adjacent
                        open slope. Although information about the biology of submarine canyon fauna
                        is still scarce, morphologic and oceanographic features of the canyons are
                        understood to be the main factors influencing faunal characteristics [157]. For example, (a) suspension feeders may
                        benefit from accelerated currents [158] and exposure of
                        hard substrate in an otherwise sediment system; (b) demersal planktivores
                        may exploit dense layers of krill and zooplankton that become concentrated
                        in canyons during downward vertical migrations [159]; (c)
                        accumulation of food for detritivores may be enhanced by high sedimentation
                        rates and accumulation of macrophytic debris [157], [160], [161]. Because of
                        their characteristics, the biodiversity of faunal assemblages can be
                        markedly different from that on the adjacent open slopes—the
                        so-called canyon effect [26]. Their
                        biomass and abundance can be 2- to 15-fold higher than that in the
                        surrounding areas at similar depths [157]. Species composition within canyons is also different from that found on the
                        surrounding slopes. Canyon assemblages generally display lower diversity for
                        the meiofaunal components because of the high dominance of a few species and
                        the lower evenness [162]. On the other hand, certain canyons may
                        contain a higher diversity of megafauna than the slopes and can be
                        considered as hot spots of diversity as they may display high rates of
                        endemism [1], [154]. This may be
                        particularly important in oligotrophic areas, which must have mechanisms for
                        the efficient recycling of energy at different scales. Therefore, certain
                        canyons are characterized as areas of high diversity and production, and as
                        such they may play an important role in processes related to the transfer of
                        matter and energy in the Mediterranean Sea [163]. The
                        analysis of foraminiferal diversity from canyon areas did not reveal the
                        presence of species confined to canyon areas [81]. However, also
                        in the Gulf of Lions, foraminiferal standing stocks and diversity (as
                        Shannon-Wiener index) are both higher at an axial site in the
                        Lacaze-Duthiers Canyon than on the adjacent slope (water depths 920 m and
                        800 m, respectively [82]). A comparative analysis of nematodes at
                        similar depths in four deep-sea canyons and on adjacent open slopes in the
                        Western and Central Mediterranean Sea suggested that species richness
                        changed significantly with increasing water depth only in about half of the
                        investigated systems. Both increasing and decreasing patterns in species
                        richness were observed. The multivariate, multiple regression analyses
                        indicated that quantity and quality of organic matter explained an important
                        portion of the variances of the diversity indices, but also temperature and
                        physicochemical conditions played an important role in determining the
                        observed patterns. In addition, the analysis of nematode biodiversity
                        revealed the presence of significant differences in species composition at
                        different depths in all of the investigated systems, indicating that,
                        independent of significant differences in species richness and organic
                        matter content, bathymetric differences were always associated with
                        significant changes in species composition. Overall, the biodiversity of
                        nematodes (expressed as both species richness and rarefied species number)
                        was not significantly different when canyons and adjacent open slopes were
                        compared. Only at 500 m depth in the Central Mediterranean Sea was nematode
                        diversity significantly lower in canyons than on slopes, possibly reflecting
                        peculiar hydrodynamic conditions that restrict the colonization of species.
                        However, topographic features could also contribute to the observed
                        differences; for example, at 500 m depth in the Central Mediterranean Sea
                        (South Adriatic margin), the lower nematode species richness in canyons
                        could be related to the presence of hard substrates [164]. In the Eastern Mediterranean, canyon and slope sediments displayed a similar
                        biodiversity, but nematode assemblages in canyons were characterized by
                        higher dominance of various genera such as Daptonema,
                            Paralongicyatholaimus, and Pomponema.
                        An upper canyon site (450 m) in the Mergenguera canyon and adjacent slope
                        (Catalan margin off Barcelona) showed higher species richness and
                        biodiversity of non-crustacean invertebrates than the middle (600 m) and
                        lower (1,200 m) slope sites [129]. This
                        difference was attributed to higher habitat heterogeneity and higher organic
                        matter availability. Furthermore, the presence or higher abundance of
                        sessile taxa such as corals and sponges on the lower slope (1,200 m) was
                        explained by intensified hydrodynamics associated with the proximity of the
                        canyon, as well as by the lack of fishing activity at 1,200 m, which allows
                        the establishment and maintenance of sessile and fragile species [129]. Crustacean biomass was also higher at
                        the canyon site, while fish abundance was higher on the slope sites [44],
                            [45]. In the Blanes canyon and adjacent
                        margin, variations in community structure have been observed between two
                        areas in the canyon (canyon head and canyon wall) and one site on the
                        adjacent margin at similar depths [26]. Here,
                        the community on the open margin has a lower species richness, lower
                        diversity, and lower evenness. The MDS (multidimensional scaling) analysis
                        and ABC (abundance-biomass curves) plots also separated the open margin
                        community from the two canyon sites. These results can be explained by
                        higher fishing intensity on the open margin, which has been affecting the
                        benthic communities for over five decades [26], [48],
                            [49]. The deep-sea basin of the Mediterranean Sea has been defined as bathyal or
                        abyssal, based on different assumptions. According to some geologists, the
                        Mediterranean Sea has no abyssal plains, and hence all the deep
                        Mediterranean basins form part of the continental margin. In the Western
                        basin the 2,600/2,700 m isobaths have been used as the upper limit of the
                        abyssal plain, which has a maximum depth of about 3,050 m. In contrast, the
                        Tyrrhenian Plain has been defined as bathyal [165], despite the
                        fact that the deepest part of the Tyrrhenian Basin exceeds 3,600 m depth
                            [14]. Bathyal and abyssal plains cover a large
                        portion of the deep Western Mediterranean Basin [166], these having
                        a triangular shape and an overall area of about 240,000 km2.
                        Sediments filling the Mediterranean abyssal plains are dominated by the
                        deposition of turbidities, but instead of being flat and homogeneous, as
                        previously described, they are characterized by the presence of seafloor
                        features up to 35 m in height [166]. The abyssal
                        basins of the Mediterranean are extremely unusual deep-sea systems. With
                        water temperatures at 4,000 m in excess of 14°C (rather than
                        4°C or colder for the deep oceanic basins) the entire benthic
                        environment is as hot as the water around a hydrothermal vent system, but
                        lacks the vents' rich chemical energy supply. The Mediterranean also differs from other deep-sea ecosystems in its species
                        composition, notably the absence of the near-ubiquitous deep-water grenadier
                        fish Coryphaenoides armatus and the amphipod
                            Eurythenes gryllus. Instead, Acanthephyra eximia appears to have functionally replaced E.
                            gryllus, the dominant deep-sea scavenging crustacean throughout
                        most of the world's oceans [167].
                            A. eximia is likely to have entered the Mediterranean
                        Sea within the last 5 million years following Pliocene flooding by waters
                        through the Strait of Gibraltar [168]. The Eastern deep basins formed roughly
                        2 million years ago, but stagnation precluded colonization for a long time
                            [50]. A certain degree of eurythermy may have
                        allowed A. eximia to become a dominant member of the
                        Mediterranean abyssal community in the absence of the stenothermal amphipod
                            E. gryllus. Barriers to colonization of the
                        Mediterranean include the differences in temperature, salinity, and food
                        supply between the Atlantic and Mediterranean, as well as the existence of
                        shallow sills in the Strait of Gibraltar and Strait of Sicily. Despite these
                        inferences and the relative youth of the system, a deep-sea fauna has
                        developed, although it is depauperate compared with that of the oceans [130]. Typical deep-water groups, such as
                        echinoderms, glass sponges, and macroscopic Foraminifera (Xenophyophora),
                        are scarce or absent in the deep basins of the Mediterranean. Other groups
                        (i.e., fishes, decapod crustaceans, mysids, and gastropods) are much less
                        abundant in the deep Mediterranean than in the northeastern Atlantic. Biogeographically, seamounts are islands separated by great depths.
                        Consequently, they may serve as isolated refuges for relict populations of
                        species that have disappeared from other areas. A complete and detailed map
                        of all Mediterranean seamounts is not available yet. Moreover,
                        investigations of seamounts have mainly been geological, while biological
                        studies have been relatively neglected. In the Western Mediterranean, the
                        Tyrrhenian bathyal plain is characterized by a large number of seamounts.
                        These volcanic bodies of tholeitic petrology are either associated with
                        north–south oriented crustal faults (Magnaghi, Vavilov, and
                        Marsili seamounts) or with crescent-shape bathymetric ridges (horsts)
                        bounded by normal faults, including the Vercelli and Cassinis ridges [169]. The Eastern Mediterranean basin is
                        characterized by a higher topographic heterogeneity than the western sector
                        and a large number of seamounts. The Eratosthenes Seamount is an impressive
                        geological structure in the Levantine Sea, the biology of which is
                        practically unknown. The only available biological information is given by
                        Galil and Zibrowius [71], who report on the collection (with trawl
                        and grab sampling at a depth of 800 m) of a limited number of benthic
                        samples. Their work yielded a relatively rich and diverse fauna consisting
                        mainly of two species of scleractinian corals (Caryophylla calveri and Desmophyllum cristagalli) (now
                            D. dianthus), two types of encrusting foraminiferans,
                        two species of encrusting poriferans, abundant scyphozoan polyps, many
                        individuals of the small actiniarian Kadophellia bathyalis,
                        seven species of bivalves, one sipunculan, one asteroid and one fish.
                        Studies have been conducted recently on soft sediments surrounding the
                        Marsili and Palinuro seamounts [97], [170]. The analysis of bacterial community
                        structure revealed that the assemblages in the sediments close to these
                        seamounts and the adjacent sediments were different. This indicates that,
                        besides the consistently observed differences in the microbial variables,
                        there are also differences in bacterial community composition between
                        sediments from seamounts and sediments from other areas [97]. In addition, the authors found a much
                        lower evenness (i.e., equitability of distribution of the OTUs among
                        species) in Archaea than in Bacteria, which suggests that a few archaeal
                        OTUs were dominant in these deep-sea sediments, whereas a much more
                        equitable distribution characterized deep-sea bacterial assemblages.
                        Overall, these findings indicate that the highest numbers of archaeal OTUs
                        were observed in sediments close to the seamounts, where the lowest evenness
                        and the highest viral production were also observed. Pusceddu et al. [170] emphasized that the biochemical
                        composition of non-seamount sediments was largely different from that at
                        Palinuro Seamount but were rather similar to the composition at Marsili
                        Seamount. Moreover, the sediments close to the seamounts tend to harbor a
                        small number of meiofaunal taxa and low nematode species richness, when
                        compared with non-seamount sediments. At the same time, there were families
                        and species exclusively present in sediments close to the seamounts and
                        absent in adjacent sediments, and vice versa. These findings suggest that
                        the deep-sea nematode assemblages of the Tyrrhenian Sea are highly site
                        specific (i.e., they can vary at a regional scale within the same basin),
                        and confirm previous studies that have indicated that the deep Mediterranean
                        Sea can be characterized by extremely high turnover diversity among sites
                        within the same basin [61]. Current research also involves other
                        seamounts, such as the Vercelli and the Dauno seamounts and seamounts in the
                        Alboran Sea. Nevertheless, the biodiversity of Mediterranean seamounts
                        remains largely unexplored, and much work is needed to discover the
                        potential contribution of these systems to the deep-Mediterranean
                        biodiversity. A deep-water coral reef is a local seafloor mound consisting of accumulations
                        of coral debris, fine- and coarse-grained sediments, and live coral colonies
                        that provide additional hard substrate extending into midwater [171]. Thus, these reefs form locally elevated
                        hard substrates associated with strong bottom currents that enhance food
                        supply and prevent the settling of silt [172], [173]. The colonial stone corals
                            Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata, which occur along the northwestern European continental
                        margin and the deep shelves and in Scandinavian fjords, are present also in
                        different sectors of the deep-Mediterranean Sea. Zibrowius [174] provides a list of the areas where
                            L. pertusa and M. oculata have been
                        found in the northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean, but the distribution
                        of these habitats along Mediterranean margins is still incompletely known.
                        Our knowledge of Mediterranean deep-water coral reefs comes from scientific
                        and fishing dredge and trawl hauls. The first record of living colonial
                        corals in the northern Ionian Sea dates back to the Pola
                        expedition of 1891 (see Text S1 for more references). Information
                        on macro- and megafauna associated with deep-water stony corals in the
                        “hard-bottom community of white corals” was first
                        reported by Pérès and Picard [175]. Recently, new
                        technologies such as the multibeam echo sounder, side scan sonar, remotely
                        operated vehicles (ROVs), and submersibles have been used to investigate the
                        deep-water corals in the Mediterranean. At present, a total of 14 coral bank areas have been censused, but only a few
                        of them have been examined by ROV dives. These include the areas from the
                        Gibraltar sill to the Gulf of Lions canyons, from the Ligurian Sea to the
                        Sicilian Channel, and from the Apulian margin to the trough off Tassos in
                        the Aegean Sea [75] (see Text S1
                        for more references). The depth distribution of the corals ranges from 150 m
                        (Strait of Gibraltar) to 1,100 m (Santa Maria di Leuca). In the
                        Mediterranean, cold-water corals generally occur along the edge of the
                        continental shelf, on offshore submarine banks and in canyons. These coral
                        communities share a set of common characteristics, including hydrographic
                        conditions and food supply within a complex local topographic setting.
                        Mediterranean deep-water reefs are associated with temperatures ranging from
                        13.4°C to 13.9°C, salinities from 38.4 to 38.9, and
                        dissolved oxygen from 3.75 to 4.54 ml L−1[75]. The temperatures in the deep
                        Mediterranean are close to the upper limit for many cold-water corals living
                        at bathyal depths [173]. The occurrence here of the two
                        deep-water colonial scleractinian species living in the Mediterranean,
                            M. oculata and L. pertusa, appears to
                        be a relict of a much more extensive distribution during the Pleistocene
                            [74], [137]. Most of the
                        deep-water scleractinian species living in this basin are solitary [174], and only M. oculata
                        and L. pertusa (so-called white coral community) are
                        distributed on bathyal hard grounds [35]. Some of the
                        solitary species, such as Desmophillum dianthus, also
                        contribute to the reef frameworks. Cold-water corals are passive suspension
                        feeders, which depend on the supply of particulate organic matter and
                        zooplankton for their subsistence and are therefore preferentially
                        distributed on topographic irregularities, such as prominent steps on canyon
                        slopes and seamounts where currents are strong and sedimentation rates are
                        low [172] (see Text S1
                        for more references). Although no quantitative comparison can be made as a
                        result of different sampling efforts and equipment used, species richness
                        appears to be higher in the SML coral reef. Here, both M. oculata and L. pertusa are present, together
                        with the black coral Leiopathes glaberrima and a large
                        number of poriferan species, which contribute to increase the habitat
                        heterogeneity of the system [72], [74], [75], [176]–[178] (see Text S1
                        for more references). Overall, 222 species (19 still unidentified) were
                        encountered in the SML coral area at depths between 280 m and 1,121 m [179]. The most diverse taxa were Porifera (36
                        species), followed by Mollusca (35), Cnidaria (31), Annelida (24), Crustacea
                        (23), and Bryozoa (19). A total of 40 benthopelagic fish species were also
                        collected. Other taxa, such as brachiopods and echinoderms, included a lower
                        number of species. The species Aka infesta and
                            Paromola cuvieri were recorded for SML coral area by
                        Schönberg and Beuck [176] and Freiwald
                        et al. [75], respectively. The sponge assemblage in
                        the SML shows a high affinity with the fauna from the Boreal region with a
                        small number of Mediterranean endemic species. Six scleractinian species
                        were found: M. oculata, L. pertusa,
                            Dendrophyllia cornigera, Desmophyllum dianthus, Stenocyathus vermiformis, and
                            Caryophyllia calveri. The gorgonians Bebryce mollis, Swiftia pallida, and Paramuricea macrospina as well as
                        the hydrozoans Clytia linearis and Halecium labrosum were also reported in this system [193]. Most of the species are boreal and
                        cosmopolitan. Among the 35 species of mollusks encountered in the SML area,
                        none was shared with the Lacaze-Duthiers area, suggesting the possible
                        presence of specific assemblages at each deep-water coral site. The most
                        common polychaete associated with both Madrepora and
                            Lophelia colonies was Eunice norvegica, which, together with Serpula vermicularis, was also found in Lacaze-Duthiers canyon,
                        Cassidaigne canyon, and Strait of Sicily. Another polychaete,
                            Vermiliopsis monodiscus, could be endemic to the
                        Mediterranean basin, while Harmothoë vesiculosa is
                        the first record for the Mediterranean. Very few crustacean species were
                        encountered (Bathynectes maravigna, Ebalia nux, Munida intermedia, M.
                            tenuimana, Rochinia rissoana, Alpheus platydactylus, and Pandalina profunda). The
                        bryozoans Schizomavella fischeri and Schizoporella neptuni grow preferentially on deep-water corals, and three
                        species (Puellina pedunculata, P. pseudoradiata pseudoradiata, and Setosellina capriensis) are
                        considered endemic to the Mediterranean. Megafauna (cephalopods, decapod
                        crustaceans, and fish) of the SML coral area showed a larger size, biomass,
                        and abundance inside than outside the coral area [179], [180]. The SML coral habitat seems to act as a
                        spawning area for the rockfish Helicolenus dactylopterus
                        and a nursery for the deep-water shark Etmopterus spinax
                        and the teleosts Merluccius merluccius,
                            Micromesistius poutassou, Phycis blennoides, and H. dactylopterus. A highly
                        diversified fauna, characterized by the presence of living M. oculata together with Corallium rubrum, was
                        also recorded in the Lacaze-Duthiers and Cassidaigne canyons [181] (see Text S1
                        for more references). The most abundant taxa, which varied according to the
                        sampling method used and the attention given to the different groups, were
                        cnidarians, bryozoans, mollusks, annelids, echinoderms, crustaceans, and
                        fish. Epibiotic bryozoans growing on deep-water corals were found to be
                        different from shallow-water assemblages and constituted a greater
                        proportion of Boreo-Atlantic species [182]. In addition,
                        complexity of the coral community in the canyons and the presence of many
                        suspension and filter feeders, were related to the energetic trophic
                        conditions characteristic of this type of habitat. A total of 51 benthic species, among them poriferans, cnidarians,
                        brachiopods, mollusks, polychaetes, crustaceans, and echinoderms, have been
                        recorded in the Strait of Sicily, where the deep-water corals are located in
                        three main areas [75], [183], [184]. Not all the fauna reported by Zibrowius
                        and Taviani [183] was found alive. Recent observations by
                        ROV off Malta revealed thick fossil coral frameworks with overgrowing coral
                        assemblages mainly consisting of M. oculata and L. pertusa associated with Corallium rubrum and
                        gorgonians [75]. The colony bases were generally
                        inhabited by the symbiotic polychaete Eunice norvegica, and
                        in some dives Dendrophyllia cornigera was detected.
                        Observations from ROV dives in the Linosa Trough showed the fossil and
                        modern coral communities thriving under overhangs and in large caves, and
                        they were particularly common in volcanic bedrock sequences. In the Urania
                        Bank, the colonies of M. oculata measured up to 70 cm high
                        and 50 cm wide, while those of L. pertusa rarely exceed 10
                        cm in size [75]. More than 980 species have been reported
                        from the Atlantic deep-water coral reefs [185] and 361
                        taxa were found in the Sula Reef [186]. Although
                        the Mediterranean deep-water coral systems are considered less diverse than
                        the Atlantic ones [35], [172], the data
                        recently acquired demonstrate that this is not the case, especially if we
                        consider that some of the taxa investigated in the Atlantic have not yet
                        been investigated in Mediterranean deep-water corals habitats. Cephalopods,
                        crustaceans, and fish can be attracted by the structural complexity of the
                        deep-water coral reefs, which may act as essential habitats for feeding and
                        spawning. Although none of the benthopelagic species so far recorded occurs
                        exclusively in the coral habitat, many of them can be collected in greater
                        abundance within coral habitats than in surrounding areas of seabed. In
                        agreement with studies carried out in the Atlantic [187]–[191], significant
                        differences were detected between the species abundance recorded within the
                        SML coral area and that recorded in surrounding muddy bottoms [180]. The deep-water coral habitats can act
                        as spawning areas for some species and nursery areas for others, as
                        suggested by the higher catches of benthopelagic species (such as the shrimp
                            Aristeus antennatus and Aristaeomorpha foliacea), as well as sharks, hakes, rockfish, greater fork
                        beard, gurnards, and blackspot seabream by long-line in these areas [180], [192]. Studies on
                        prokaryotic assemblages associated with the deep-sea coral Lophelia pertusa in the Central Mediterranean Sea revealed that they
                        possess a specific microbial assemblage, which is different from that
                        observed on dead corals and on surrounding sediment samples [193]. The majority of coral-associated OTUs
                        were related to the Holophaga-Acidobacterium and Nitrospira divisions
                        (80%), while more than 12% formed a separate
                        deep-branching cluster within the Alpha-Proteobacteria with no known close
                        relatives [193]. These authors reported that Archaea
                        were not detected on living L. pertusa specimens, in
                        contrast to previous findings on tropical coastal corals [194]. Most hydrothermal vents in the Mediterranean with described biological
                        assemblages occur in shallow depths of less than 100 m [195]. Consequently,
                        a profound difference between these and the described oceanic deep-sea vents
                        is the occurrence of photosynthetic primary production. Also, the species
                        that inhabit shallow-water Mediterranean hydrothermal vents are not endemic
                        to these habitats but represent a subgroup of the most tolerant species in
                        the ambient fauna. The only published evidence for deep-sea hydrothermalism
                        in the Mediterranean consists of indicators of extinct activity observed on
                        the peak of Marsili Seamount in the Tyrrhenian Basin at about
                        450–500 m depth [196]. The first biological evidence for reduced environments was the presence of
                        Lucinidae and Vesicomyidae shells cored on the top of the Napoli mud
                        volcano, located at 1,900 m depth on the Mediterranean ridge in the
                        subduction zone of the African plate [197]. This was
                        followed by the description of a new Lucinidae bivalve species,
                            Lucinoma kazani, associated with bacterial
                        endosymbionts [198]. In the southeastern Mediterranean,
                        communities of polychaetes and bivalves were also found associated with cold
                        seeps and carbonates near Egypt and the Gaza Strip at depths of
                        500–800 m, but no living fauna was collected [199]. The first in
                        situ observations of extensive living chemosynthetic communities in the
                        Eastern Mediterranean Sea prompted cooperation between biologists,
                        geochemists, and geologists. During submersible dives, communities
                        comprising large fields of small bivalves (dead and alive), large siboglinid
                        tube worms, isolated or forming dense aggregations, large sponges, and
                        associated endemic fauna were observed in various cold seep habitats
                        associated with carbonate crusts at 1,700–2,000 m depth. Two mud
                        volcano fields were first explored, one along the Mediterranean Ridge, where
                        most of them were partially (Napoli, Milano mud volcanoes) or totally
                        (Urania, Maidstone mud volcanoes) affected by brines, and the other on the Anaximander mounds south of Turkey. The latter area includes the large Amsterdam mud volcano, which is affected by recent mudflows, and the smaller
                        Kazan or Kula mud volcanoes [200], [201]. Gas hydrates have been sampled at the
                        Amsterdam and Kazan mud volcanoes, and high methane levels have been
                        recorded above the seafloor [202]. Several
                        provinces of the Nile deep-sea fan have been explored recently. These
                        include the very active brine seepage named the Menes Caldera in the eastern
                        province between 2,500 m and 3,000 m [203], the pockmarks
                        in the central area along mid- and lower slopes [204], and the mud
                        volcanoes of the eastern province, as well as one in the central upper slope
                        (North Alex area) at 500 m depth [205]. During these first exploratory dives, symbiont-bearing taxa that are similar
                        to those observed on the Olimpi and Anaximander mud fields were sampled and identified. This similarity is not surprising, as most of these taxa were originally described from dredging in the Nile fan [206]. The updated
                        table (Table
                            S5 and Text S2) shows the diversity of the fauna
                        in the various seep habitats explored since 1998. Up to five species of bivalves harboring bacterial symbionts colonized these methane- and sulfide-rich environments. A new species of Siboglinidae polychaete, the tubeworm colonizing cold seeps from the Mediterranean ridge to the Nile deep-sea fan, has just been described [207]. Moreover,
                        the study of symbioses revealed associations with chemoautotrophic Bacteria,
                        sulfur oxidizers in Vesicomyidae and Lucinidae bivalves and Siboglinidae
                        tubeworms [200], [208], [209], and highlighted the exceptional
                        diversity of Bacteria living in symbiosis with small Mytilidae [210]. The Mediterranean seeps appear to
                        represent a rich habitat characterized by megafauna species richness (e.g.,
                        gastropods) or the exceptional size of some species such as sponges
                            (Rhizaxinella pyrifera) and crabs (Chaceon mediterraneus), compared with their background counterparts.
                        This contrasts with the low macro- and mega-faunal abundance and diversity
                        of the deep Eastern Mediterranean. Seep communities in the Mediterranean
                        that include endemic chemosynthetic species and associated fauna differ from
                        the other known seep communities in the world at the species level but also
                        by the absence of the large size bivalve genera Calyptogena
                        or Bathymodiolus
                        [211], [212]. The isolation
                        of the Mediterranean seeps from the Atlantic Ocean after the Messinian
                        crisis led to the development of unique communities, which are likely to
                        differ in composition and structure from those in the Atlantic Ocean.
                        Further expeditions involved quantitative sampling of habitats in different
                        areas, from the Mediterranean Ridge to the eastern Nile deep-sea fan [213].
                        Finally, cold seeps recently discovered in the Marmara Sea [214] have also revealed chemosynthesis-based
                        communities that showed a considerable similarity to the symbiont-bearing
                        fauna of eastern Mediterranean cold seeps [213]. Numerous deep hypersaline anoxic basins (DHABs) have been discovered in the
                        Eastern Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. The six
                        DHABs of the Eastern Mediterranean (L'Atalante, Urania, Bannock,
                        Discovery, Tyro, and La Medee) are located on the Mediterranean Ridge. The
                        Mediterranean DHABs lie at depths ranging from 3,200 m to 3,600 m and
                        contain brine, the origin of which has been attributed to the dissolution of
                        5.9- to 5.3-million-year-old Messinian evaporites [215]. Brines enclosed
                        in these basins are characterized by high abundances, which hamper the
                        mixing with overlying oxic seawater and result in a sharp chemocline and
                        anoxic conditions. The combination of nearly saturated salt concentration
                        and corresponding high density and high hydrostatic pressure, absence of
                        light, anoxia, and a sharp chemocline makes these basins some of the most
                        extreme habitats on earth. The brines of the L'Atalante, Bannock, and Urania basins have
                        similar dominant ion compositions, but in the Urania the overall salinity is
                        lower, whereas concentrations of sulfide and methane are considerably higher
                            [216]. The Discovery basin is unique in that
                        the brines have an extremely high concentration of Mg2+
                        and low concentration of Na+[216] and represents the marine environment
                        with the lowest reported water activity [217]. Studies
                        of prokaryotic life in the Discovery, L'Atalante, Urania, and
                        Bannock basins using epifluorescence microscopy, analyses of 16S ribosomal
                        RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequences, and measurement of sulfate reduction,
                        methanogenesis, and heterotrophic activity have revealed metabolically
                        active bacterial and archaeal communities [217]–[222]. Van der Wielen
                        and coworkers [216] investigated prokaryotic communities in
                        all of the Mediterranean DHABs. They reported that Bacteria dominated the
                        Discovery basin and were slightly more abundant in L'Atalante and
                        Bannock basins, whereas Archaea dominated the Urania basin. In all four
                        hypersaline basins, bacterial diversity was higher than archaeal diversity,
                        and the Urania basin displayed the lowest overall diversity. Analyses of the
                        16S rRNA gene sequences showed that high percentages of clone sequences
                        obtained from the four different deep hypersaline anoxic basins belonged to
                        Gamma-, Delta-, and Epsilon-Proteobacteria, Sphingobacteria, candidate
                        division KB1, and Halobacteria. Many of the dominant archaeal sequences
                        belonged to the new subdivision MSBL1. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S
                        rRNA gene sequences revealed that microbial communities found in the brines
                        are not found in normal seawater [216]. Such
                        differences are probably related to the different geochemical conditions of
                        the different basins together with their physical separation from each other
                        and isolation from the oxygenated deep-water layers for possibly millions of
                        years. This isolation may have resulted in the evolution of specific
                        microbial communities in each DHAB. The analysis of prokaryotic diversity
                        across the seawater-brine interface of the Bannock, L'Atalante, and
                        Urania basins revealed that many prokaryotic taxa, including
                        phylogenetically new groups, collectively formed a diverse, sharply
                        stratified deep-sea ecosystem [218], [221], [222]. In both the Bannock and L'Atalante basins, Bacteria and Archaea were
                        present in similar abundances in the oxic seawater above the hypersaline
                        brine, whereas the seawater–brine interface was dominated by
                        Bacteria and showed a bacterial diversity higher than in the overlying deep
                        seawater. In the Bannock basin, five new candidate divisions (MSBL2, 3, 4,
                        5, and 6) were also identified in the seawater-brine interface through clone
                        libraries. Microbial communities of the upper level of the halocline
                        (meso-bathypelagic waters) displayed a large abundance of Crenarchaeota,
                        whereas the bottom layers hosted different groups of Euryarchaeota. Members
                        of the Haloarchaea were found only in a narrow window of the halocline at
                        130% salinity. In the Urania Basin, the seawater–brine
                        interface and the brine were largely dominated by Bacteria, and Archaea
                        contributed less than 0.2% of the prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene [222]. The overlying oxic seawater was dominated
                        by Alpha- and Gamma-Proteobacteria and Fibrobacteres, whereas the anoxic
                        layers were dominated by Delta- and Epsilon-Proteobacteria. A recent study
                        carried out on the thermal mud fluids of Urania Basin, revealed the presence
                        of a highly diverse prokaryotic community [220], mostly
                        composed of unculturable prokaryotes. Archaeal diversity was much lower than
                        bacterial diversity (more than 96% of the archaeal clones
                        belonged to the MSBL-1 candidate order). About 60% of all
                        bacterial and 40% of all archaeal phylotypes were encountered
                        only in mud fluids and not in the upper layers of the brines. Here, dominant
                        phylotypes are affiliated with the Epsilon-Proteobacteria subdivision and
                        Delta-Proteobacteria. A novel monophyletic clade was also retrieved from
                        deep-sea sediments and halocline of the Urania Basin. Recently, the first metazoa living in the permanently anoxic conditions of
                        the L'Atalante basin were discovered [223]. Danovaro et
                        al [223] reported that the sediments of the
                        L'Atalante basin were inhabited by three species of the animal
                        phylum Loricifera (Spinoloricus nov. sp.,
                            Rugiloricus nov. sp. and Pliciloricus nov.
                            sp.) new to science. Using different techniques, Danovaro et al
                            [223] provided evidence that these organisms
                        were metabolically active and showed specific adaptations to the extreme
                        conditions of the deep basin, such as the lack of mitochondria, and a large
                        number of hydrogenosome-like organelles, associated with endosymbiotic
                        prokaryotes. Little is known about longitudinal gradients across the deep-sea regions.
                    Previous studies suggested that the west–east gradient of decreasing
                    surface water productivity of the Mediterranean Sea is reflected in a
                    corresponding gradient of decreasing food availability in deep-sea sediments
                        [18], [62]. Such a gradient
                    could be responsible for a significant decrease in the abundance and biomass of
                    most benthic components, including Meiofauna, Macrofauna, and Megafauna.
                    However, surprisingly our results indicate that there is no corresponding
                    gradient for most components of benthic biodiversity (e.g., number of species
                    and ES(100); Figure 2). Only
                    the diversity of Foraminifera showed an apparent east-to-west increase in
                    species richness [85]–[87]. However, data on
                    Foraminifera have mainly originated from geological studies that employ varied
                    methodologies (e.g., different sieve fractions, depth intervals, wet vs. dry
                    sorting, dead vs. live assemblages), which often hamper a thorough statistical
                    synthesis of the data. Conversely for other biodiversity components, such as
                    benthic prokaryotes, higher biodiversity values were occasionally observed in
                    the central-eastern sector of the deep Mediterranean. Finally, some deep-sea
                    benthic components showed highly variable diversity values at all longitudes,
                    without any significant patterns across the regions investigated (Figure 2). The longitudinal
                    trends are therefore apparently weak and inconsistent across different
                    components of the deep-sea biota. These results suggest that the effects of food
                    supply (energy availability) may be important for certain components but can be
                    compensated or masked by other factors that influence deep-sea diversity. Bathymetric gradients of species diversity have been more widely documented than
                    longitudinal gradients [4], [106], [224] (see
                        Text
                        S1 for more references). A central paradigm of marine diversity is
                    that species richness increases with increasing water depth to a maximum at
                    mid-slopes (around 2,000 m) and thereafter decreases [224], [225].
                    The enhanced levels of biodiversity along slopes are possibly a source for
                    biodiversity for deeper basins and shelves, through radiation and dispersal
                    processes closely coupled with benthic topography and the hydrodynamic,
                    physical, and biogeochemical characteristics of the deep sea. The recent
                    “source-sink hypothesis” [226] suggests, indeed,
                    that abyssal biodiversity is a subset of bathyal biodiversity (in particular the
                    biodiversity of the slopes at depths typically between 1,000 m and 2,500 m).
                    However, this hypothesis has so far only been tested for gastropods and bivalves
                        [12], and many studies have provided evidence of
                    reproductively active abyssal species. Results reported here (Figure 3) indicate that none
                    of the benthic faunal components displayed the unimodal pattern of biodiversity
                    with peaks at intermediate water depths (1,500–2,500 m) [226].
                    Therefore, the hump-shaped curve does not reflect the patterns of deep-sea
                    biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. The comparison between bathymetric patterns of biodiversity expressed as species
                    richness and expected species number provides evidence of a generally negative
                    slope for species richness. Such a pattern is probably related to the
                    exponential decrease of abundance observed for all animal components. However,
                    different benthic components display different spatial patterns with increasing
                    depth. For instance, the number of bacterial and archaeal OTUs did not change
                    significantly with increasing water depth, indicating that the biodiversity of
                    benthic prokaryotes encountered at the greatest depths was similar to the values
                    reported at 200 m depth. This result is consistent with the patterns of
                    organismal abundance described by Rex et al. [227], who reported that
                    the abundance of three animal groups (Meiofauna, Macrofauna, and Megafauna)
                    decreased significantly with depth, while bacterial abundance remained constant.
                    As reported for patterns in animal abundance, the biodiversity of all other
                    benthic components decreased significantly with increasing water depth. However,
                    the slopes of the abundance values differed significantly; the biggest
                    difference was observed comparing the Mega- and Macrofauna that decrease with
                    depth more rapidly than the Meiofauna [227]. We found the
                    opposite for biodiversity. In fact, while the slopes of the abundances with
                    increasing depth is greater for Prokaryotes than Meiofauna than Macrofauna than
                    Megafauna, we found the slopes of biodiversity greater for Megafauna than
                    Macrofauna than Meiofauna (as Nematoda; analysis of covariance, Johnson-Neyman
                    tests). Finally, the slope of Foraminifera displayed intermediate values between
                    Meiofauna and Macrofauna. These results suggest that even though abundance of
                    Mega- and Macrofauna decreases exponentially with depth, a large number of
                    species can be found at great depths, while the abundance of nematodes decreases
                    with depth to a lesser extent, but this is associated with a stronger reduction
                    in species richness. This finding could indicate that the patterns of
                    biodiversity could be dependent on the size of the organisms and probably the
                    greater ability of larger organisms to move and disperse across different
                    bathymetric ranges, which can be crucial for shaping biodiversity patterns. If spatial patterns of biodiversity in the deep sea are beginning to be
                    clarified, our comprehension of the mechanisms driving these patterns is still
                    poor. Various biological and environmental factors have been proposed to explain
                    why species diversity changes with depth. Those more frequently invoked are (a)
                    sediment grain size and substrate heterogeneity, (b) productivity, organic
                    content or microbial features, (c) food resources, (d) oxygen availability, (e)
                    current regimes, and (f) catastrophic disturbances [4], [225]
                    (see Text
                        S1 for more references). However, for each deep-sea biotic group
                    (Prokaryotes, Foraminifera, Meiofauna, Macrofauna, and Megafauna), or for each
                    phylum or lower taxonomic level within each benthic component, these factors can
                    act in different combinations and can overwhelm other local or regional factors,
                    thus causing unpredictable biotic responses [225]. Our analysis,
                    providing the first detailed look at benthic biodiversity patterns along depth
                    gradients, suggests that while the decrease in organic carbon input with depth
                    can control benthic organismal abundance along depth gradients [227], the
                    same could not hold true for the benthic biodiversity. For instance, bacterial
                    and prokaryotic abundance remain high and rather constant throughout the depth
                    range both at a global scale [227] and in the deep Mediterranean [99],
                    and similar patterns are observed in bacterial and archaeal diversity. In the
                    Central Mediterranean Sea, changes in quality and quantity of organic matter
                    were associated with shifts in bacterial community structure, but not to
                    different biodiversity values [88]. Buhring et al. [228] demonstrated that
                    the Eastern Mediterranean is characterized by impoverished,
                    “energy-thirsty” benthic microbial assemblages, which
                    respond rapidly to inputs of fresh organic matter and are characterized by a
                    well-developed benthic microbial loop [229] (see Text S1 for
                    more references). The richness of bacterial assemblages inhabiting these
                    energy-poor sediments is extremely high and comparable to estimates obtained
                    from terrestrial ecosystems, indicating that deep-sea prokaryotic species of the
                    eastern basin may have evolved under starvation stress to optimize the use of
                    the available organic matter. As far as the archaeal component is concerned,
                    temperature could be important in explaining the variance of deep benthic
                    archaeal OTU richness, while water depth has apparently a negligible role.
                    However, the information available is still too limited to fully understand
                    which environmental factors influence the patterns of prokaryotic biodiversity
                    in Mediterranean deep-sea sediments [96], [95]. Thus, we conclude that the drivers of
                    prokaryotic diversity in the deep-sea sediments of the Mediterranean Sea have
                    yet to be identified. Among Foraminifera, the abundance of deep-infaunal species decreases from west to
                    east, corresponding to the productivity gradient. Previous studies suggested
                    that the diversity of Foraminifera is related to organic matter flux settling to
                    the seafloor [225], [230], and that the same
                    could apply to the deep Mediterranean. Deep infaunal species virtually disappear
                    in the Eastern Mediterranean, where the sparse fauna consist almost entirely of
                    shallow infaunal species living close to the sediment surface [87].
                    Deep infaunal species are believed to consume low-quality, degraded organic
                    matter and Bacteria, whereas shallow infaunal species are believed to consume
                    labile material [230]–[233]. Moreover, some
                    deep infaunal species store nitrate that they respire to dinitrogen gas [234], [235]. These ecological
                    contrasts suggest that faunal differences between the Western and Eastern
                    Mediterranean may have consequences for ecosystem functioning. Deep-sea nematode assemblages are characterized by relatively high biodiversity
                    values at all depths. In accordance with previous studies [236], the number of taxa
                    decreases with increasing depth along the open slopes in all investigated areas.
                    However, the patterns in the deep Mediterranean are not always evident when
                    comparing the western and central-eastern basins. In addition, biodiversity
                    patterns can display either decreasing or increasing trends with increasing
                    depth, depending on the system investigated (e.g., slopes or canyons) [64],
                        [162], [237]. These results
                    suggest that biodiversity patterns are also dependent on different topographic
                    and ecological features. This underlines the importance of better understanding
                    specific topographic features and suggests new approaches for the investigation
                    of deep-sea biodiversity, which needs to be tightly linked to the geosphere
                    characteristics. The quality and quantity of the food supplied to the seafloor are assumed to be
                    the most important factor affecting the composition and abundance of deep-sea
                    Macro- and Megafauna [238]. The deep Mediterranean Megafauna is
                    significantly impoverished when compared with similar Atlantic and Pacific
                    ecosystems [239]. The overall biomass of Megafauna (fish and
                    crustaceans) in the western Mediterranean varies from about 150 kg
                        km−2 below 800 m depth to a peak of about 1,200 kg
                        km−2 at 1,200–1,300 m depth, decreasing again
                    to less than 200 kg km−2 below 2,000 m depth [26], [108], [128].
                    In the Porcupine Seabight (northeastern Atlantic), Lampitt et al. [240]
                    report Megafauna biomass of 5,000 to 10,000 kg km−2, which
                    is an order of magnitude more than that observed in the Mediterranean. Despite
                    Megafauna composition displaying differences between the western and eastern
                    basins, similar bathymetric patterns of species richness have been observed
                        [116], [123], [128].
                    Below 1,000 m depth, the species of the Macrouridae and Moridae families were
                    dominant in all areas investigated. The main differences recorded in the
                    Megafauna throughout the Mediterranean concern the occurrence and the abundance
                    of some species, such as the crustacean Stereomastis sculpta
                    and the fish Alepocephalus rostratus, in the Western
                    Mediterranean and the total lack in the eastern basin [123], [128].
                    The shark Centroscymnus coelolepis seems to be exclusively
                    distributed in the Western Mediterranean [241], [242],
                    while Centrophorus granulosus is present also in the eastern
                    basin. Its occurrence in the eastern basin was only recorded using lander
                    platforms equipped with baited cameras [70], which can provide
                    only images from which the taxonomic identification is uncertain. The absence of
                        Centroscymnus coelolepis in the Eastern Mediterranean
                    remains an open question [50] but could be due to the distance from the
                    point of faunal entry at the Gibraltar Strait or to the difficulty that a truly
                    deep species faces in passing the shallow Siculo-Tunisian sill. This is a clear
                    example of the difficulty deep-water Atlantic species may experience in
                    spreading across the entire Mediterranean. Direct comparisons of biodiversity
                    patterns between Mediterranean and other oceans' fauna are scarce. An
                    example is the study by Massutí et al. [239] on fish fauna,
                    comparing data from 20 years of trawling in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The
                    authors found significant differences in deep-sea fish abundance, species
                    richness, and composition. Fish species richness was lower in the Mediterranean
                    than in the deep Atlantic [239] and this has also been observed for other
                    faunal groups such as gastropods [113], asteroids [243],
                    and Asellota isopods (see Text S1 for more references). The presence of certain habitats, such as submarine canyons, cold-water corals,
                    or cold seeps, can provide additional information about environmental factors
                    that influence the abundance and distribution of deep-sea benthic species (Figure 4). However, a
                    comparative analysis of the benthic diversity across different ecosystem types
                    is difficult because of the different amount of data collected in different
                    habitats and the heterogeneous focus on different taxa in each system. In the
                    present study, we attempted to compare the biodiversity associated with open
                    slopes, canyons, deep-water coral habitats, seamounts (i.e., in the sediments
                    surrounding the seamount), and deep basins. To allow a more homogenous
                    comparison, we considered only the foraminiferal, Nematoda (for Meiofauna),
                    macrofaunal diversity expressed as ES(100), and megafaunal diversity expressed
                    as species richness. Deep-sea canyons, for instance, can act as essential
                    habitats for certain megafaunal species, which find a suitable environment for
                    feeding, reproduction, and growth, often related to the increased availability
                    of organic matter due to the enhanced transport of particles from the shelf down
                    the canyon [26], [44], [46],
                        [48], [154], [157], [244],
                        [245]. This is confirmed by data in Figure 4 that show the
                    significantly higher megafaunal diversity in deep-sea canyons of the
                    Mediterranean than on open slopes. This pattern apparently does not hold for
                    foraminiferal and meiofaunal diversity, which were equivalent in slopes and
                    canyons (ANOVA, p not significant). However, all animal
                    components investigated displayed significantly lower values in the deep basin
                    than in slopes and canyons (ANOVA, p<0.01). For
                    cold-water corals, the complex structure provided by the frame-building species
                    provides refuges for many species and increases habitat heterogeneity, creating
                    a suitable environment for recruitment and growth of many other species. This is
                    confirmed by the large number of megafaunal species (comparable to that of
                    slopes) and by the extremely high values of meiofaunal (as Nematoda) diversity
                    (as ES(100)), which displayed significantly higher values in coral systems than
                    in any other ecosystem type. A proper comparison for seamounts is difficult
                    because Meiofauna and Macrofauna have been not investigated systematically in
                    these habitats. However, comparing the sediments surrounding the bases of the
                    seamounts with those of all other systems, the lowest values can be observed,
                    probably a result of the turbulence and hydrodynamics associated with the
                    seamount. In cold seeps, the trophic structure is completely different, as here
                    there is primary production from chemoautotrophic Bacteria, which fuel the
                    benthic community with a supplementary and continuous food source not found in
                    the heterotrophic deep-sea ecosystems. Data available so far from the
                    Mediterranean are too limited to make a comparison, but the species richness is
                    likely to be lower than in any other system. Despite the number of kingdoms in the deep sea being smaller than in coastal
                    systems because of the absence of photoautotrophic taxa, there is no deep-sea
                    area or station where the total biodiversity (i.e., the biodiversity of all
                    forms of life ranging from Bacteria and Archaea to Megafauna) has been censused.
                    We made a first attempt to quantify the total deep-sea diversity on the basis of
                    the species identified so far for the Foraminifera, Nematoda (for Meiofauna),
                    Macrofauna, and Megafauna (Figure
                        5). Within the bathymetric range of 200–1,000 m,
                    approximately 650 species belonging to the Eukarya domain have been encountered,
                    and Megafauna and Nematoda contributed almost equally to total biodiversity,
                    while Foraminifera and Macrofauna contributed to a lesser extent (Figure 5). The total number of
                    species decreased by almost half moving to the bathymetric range of
                    1,000–2,000 m, with a contextual increase of the meio- and macrofaunal
                    contribution to the overall biodiversity. Deeper than 2,000 m, the global
                    biodiversity was further reduced by about 40%, with a notable
                    increase of the relative importance of the foraminiferal
                    (20–30%) and meiofaunal diversity
                    (60–80%). Table 1 illustrates the present state of knowledge of deep-sea
                    biodiversity encountered from 200 m to more than 4,000 m depth in the entire
                    Mediterranean basin. The values reported here are certainly an underestimate,
                    not only because of the large number of still undiscovered species (see below)
                    but also because the diversity of most phyla (e.g., Nemertea, Gnathostomulida,
                    Kinorhyncha, Loricifera, Rotifera, Gastrotricha) has not been determined. Data
                    reported here highlight the presence of clear differences in knowledge of the
                    components of the deep-sea biota. Such differences are evident in the fragmented
                    spatial coverage of the investigations, and it is clear that the claims that
                        “the different parts of the deep Mediterranean have not
                        been equally sampled” [107], and that
                        “the relative species richness of … faunas of the
                        different sectors of Mediterranean is better correlated with the level of
                        research effort than the true species richness” [246] still hold true after 20 years of intensive
                    deep-sea research.  Reported are (a) sum of the number of species of Foraminifera (as live
                            specimens), Meiofauna (as Nematoda), Macrofauna, and Megafauna, and (b)
                            relative contribution of the different benthic components to the total
                            diversity (expressed as percentage). Note that data for megafauna
                            beneath 2,000 m depth are not available.

              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011832.t001 One of the major unknowns in the deep Mediterranean is related to the
                    quantification of the actual benthic microbial diversity. This includes Bacteria
                    and Archaea, but to a large extent also the nanoflagellates and other protists
                    (with the exception of Foraminifera). Although the last decades have seen a
                    significant increase in projects sampling in the bathyal and abyssal
                    Mediterranean, the areas covered and the number of samples are still limited. In
                    the present study, we did not make an in-depth estimate of the potential
                    microbial diversity of the deep-Mediterranean Sea, because different results can
                    be obtained depending on the molecular technique used to measure microbial
                    diversity. For instance, using a fingerprinting technique (ARISA), the number of
                    total deep-sea bacterial species could be close to 4,000, but the same
                    calculation based on the rarefaction curves obtained from clone libraries (Figure 6a) would give much
                    higher diversity.  The equations of the rarefaction curves are reported in Table
                                S7. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011832.g006 Using the equations derived from the rarefaction curves reported in Figure 6 (b–e) for
                    the different animal groups and quantifying the abundance of each component per
                    square meter at each bathymetric range and the areal extension of each depth
                    range (Table
                        S6), we attempted to estimate the potential number of species hosted
                    by deep-sea sediments of the Mediterranean (the equations of the rarefaction
                    curves are reported in Table S7). The results illustrated in Figure 7 indicate that at all
                    depths the largest number of expected species is for Nematoda (Meiofauna),
                    followed by Foraminifera, Megafauna (particularly in the range
                    200–2,000 m), and Macrofauna. We also compared these data with the
                    number of species currently known for each bathymetric range and estimated the
                    number of potentially unknown species for each faunal group. According to the
                    patterns described above, the largest number and fraction of unknown diversity
                    lie within the meiofaunal size (Foraminifera and Nematoda), but a significant
                    number of undiscovered species are also expected within the megafaunal and
                    macrofaunal components (approximately 200 and 270 species, respectively; Figure 7). These estimates are
                    subject to a large degree of uncertainty because of the problems in determining
                    accurate values of abundance of all groups in all sampling ranges and in the
                    error associated with each equation derived from rarefaction curves. However, if
                    estimates reported here for the investigated animal groups represent the actual
                    proportion between known and unknown diversity, it could be concluded that
                    approximately 66% (947 over 2,805 species expected) of the total
                    deep-sea Mediterranean diversity remains undiscovered (Table 1).  Reported are (a) total number of expected species, (b) total number of
                            unknown expected species, and (c) the relative contribution of the
                            unknown expected species on the total diversity for Foraminifera,
                            Meiofauna (as Nematoda), Macrofauna, and Megafauna. The expected number
                            of species for each component has been estimated using the equations of
                            the rarefaction curves reported in the caption of Figure 6. Details on the estimates of
                            area per bathymetric range and the average abundance of each component
                            are summarized in Table S6. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011832.g007 The rate of new species discovery within the phylum Nematoda in the last 15 years
                    has been about 15 species per year [247]. Assuming
                    this rate of discovery, we would need 70 to 235 years just to complete a census
                    of the deep-sea Mediterranean nematodes. Experience suggests several points to be considered in future research to advance
                    our knowledge of the biodiversity and ecosystem function of the deep benthic
                    Mediterranean. For topographically isolated habitats such as deep-water corals,
                    cold seeps, and submarine canyons, their irregular presence along the
                    continental margin of the Mediterranean suggests the need for studies aimed at
                    understanding the connections among interspersed systems as well as the
                    importance of the integrity of each system to the sustainable functioning and
                    biodiversity of adjacent systems. Molecular studies of basin-isolated populations of benthic species would advance
                    our understanding of their history and trace how they were affected by the
                    cataclysms that have been part of the history of the deep Mediterranean. Such
                    studies could, in turn, help us to understand the impact of the sapropelic
                    conditions described in some catastrophic scenarios such as
                    landslides”. The “impoverished” populations of the
                    Mediterranean deep sea are in fact able survivors or agile colonizers. Facing a
                    future of global perturbations, we would do well to study them. Future priorities for deep-sea research in the Mediterranean include fine-scale
                    analysis of the interactions between spatial heterogeneity at different scales
                    and deep-sea biodiversity. Are the mosaic distribution of deep-sea biodiversity
                    and the interaction of biotic and abiotic processes different at different
                    spatial scales? Are the components of biodiversity contributing in the same way
                    to deep-sea ecosystem functioning (e.g., ecological efficiency in exploiting
                    available resources)? Is the loss of a specific benthic component harmful to the
                    biodiversity of other benthic components? Such information for deep-sea benthos
                    is clearly a primary issue for understanding deep-sea ecosystem functioning. When settled on the seafloor, litter alters the habitat, either by furnishing
                    hard substrate where none was available before or by overlying the sediment,
                    inhibiting gas exchange, and interfering with life on the seabed. This is a
                    persistent, but overlooked, problem for marine ecosystems worldwide, and its
                    potential as a hazard for marine biota has been acknowledged only in recent
                    decades [248]. It is of even greater importance in the
                    land-enclosed Mediterranean Sea with its intensive shipping activity. In 1975,
                    estimates of vessel-generated refuse discarded into the Mediterranean, based on
                    1964 shipping data, were close to 325,000 t. In the decades since, the number of
                    mercantile vessels sailing in the waters of the Mediterranean has increased
                    dramatically in 2006, 13,000 merchant vessels made 252,000 calls at
                    Mediterranean ports and an additional 10,000 vessels transited through the sea.
                    It is reasonable to suppose that litter input from vessels has increased as
                    well. Studies of marine litter in the Mediterranean include surveys of seabed
                    debris on the continental shelf, slope, and bathyal plain [249]–[251].
                    In most studies, plastic items accounted for much of the debris, sometimes as
                    much as 90% or more of the total, owing to their ubiquitous use and
                    poor degradability. A survey of seabed litter at depths ranging from 194 m to
                    4,614 m, from the Gulf of Taranto to the southeastern Levant, showed that the
                    most common litter items were paint chips (44%) and plastics
                    (36%). The presence of paint chips in half of the sites surveyed
                    indicates that much of the litter originated from shipping. Most litter items
                    were nonbuoyant objects such as glass and metal that probably sank in place
                        [249]. Munitions and bombs have been also discharged at sea, especially during
                    activities in Kosovo, and their dumping in open waters contributes to seafloor
                    contamination. Another major threat to the benthic fauna is the presence of lost
                    or discarded fishing gear, such as nets and longlines, which continue ghost
                    fishing and can damage fragile ecosystems such as cold-water corals. Chemical contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants, toxic metals (e.g.,
                    Hg, Cd, Pb, Ni), radioactive compounds, pesticides, herbicides, and
                    pharmaceuticals are also accumulating in deep-sea sediments [252].
                    Topography (e.g., presence of canyons) and hydrography (e.g., cascading events)
                    play a major role in the transportation and accumulation of these chemicals from
                    the coast and shelf to the deep basins, affecting the local fauna. Recent
                    studies have detected the presence of significant levels of dioxins in the
                    commercial shrimp Aristeus antennatus
                    [253] and significant levels of persistent organic
                    pollutants in mesopelagic and bathypelagic cephalopods [254]. The thermohaline circulation oxygenates the deep and bottom layers in the
                    Mediterranean. This vertical circulation is forced by the deep-water formation
                    processes occurring under favorable meteorological conditions in the Gulf of
                    Lions and the northern Adriatic [255], [256]. However, events
                    in the past 20 years demonstrated the instability of the process. An abrupt
                    change in hydrography and large-scale circulation of the deep waters of the
                    Eastern Mediterranean resulted from a unique, high-volume influx of dense waters
                    from the Aegean Sea during the 1990s. The event, named “Eastern
                    Mediterranean Transient” (EMT) [257], caused
                    significant changes in deep-sea biodiversity [258]. Extreme
                    scenarios of climate change predict changes in the site of deep-water formation
                    and a weakening of thermohaline circulation, which could result in changes in
                    the oxygenation and biogeochemical cycles in the bottom layers of the deep
                    Mediterranean Sea [148]. Recently, episodic or catastrophic events
                    have been described as one of the main environmental contributors to faunal
                    disturbance and thus one of the main potential drivers of deep-sea biodiversity
                        [225], [259]. Limited
                    information is available, but the effects of these episodic events on the deep
                    Mediterranean Sea appear relevant (Cap de Creus Canyon, Western Mediterranean)
                        [15], [260]. An important
                    ecological effect on the maintenance of Aristeus antennatus
                    populations in the northwestern Mediterranean has been linked to the episodic
                    events of dense water cascading on the Gulf of Lions [260]. These events are
                    climate-driven processes, and therefore climate change will have an impact on
                    the frequency and intensity of cascading, with unknown effects on the benthic
                    fauna. Another potential effect of climate change is related to energy transport
                    from surface waters to the seafloor [261], [262].
                    Primary production will change in the surface layers according to sun exposure,
                    water temperature, major stratification of water masses, for example, and this
                    will affect the food chain down to the deep seafloor, which will be subject to
                    differences in quantity, quality, and timing of organic matter input. Also,
                    recent years have seen an increase in gelatinous organisms, which, when they
                    sink, result in an important transport of energy to the deep sea. This can have
                    significant implications for certain species, such as the fish
                        Alepocephalus rostratus, which feeds mainly on gelatinous
                    organisms. Its populations form more than 60% of the megafaunal
                    biomass at the deep continental margins of the western and central Mediterranean
                    basins. Finally, the Mediterranean supports important and increasing commercial fishing
                    activity, which is entering deeper waters as the shallower resources are
                    depleted. For example, the commercial fleet of the Catalan Sea has exploited the
                    rose shrimp Aristeus antennatus for over six decades and is now
                    fishing at depths of about 900 m. Little is known about the effects of
                    deep-water trawling on benthic fauna and habitat. Pioneer studies have shown
                    that intense commercial trawling may trigger sediment gravity flows with an
                    increase in near-bottom turbidity of one order of magnitude, an increase in
                    current velocity of two to four times, and an increase in horizontal sediment
                    fluxes of one to three orders of magnitude [263], [264].
                    The effects on the fauna, however, are unknown and need further investigation.
                    Previous research and joint efforts of the World Wildlife Fund and the
                    International Union for Conservation of Nature have led to the ban on trawling
                    below 1,000 m [25], making the deep benthic Mediterranean the
                    largest protected area in the world. Such precaution is of major importance, as
                    it protects an ecosystem that is mostly unknown. Nevertheless, this situation
                    needs to be monitored and managed. Future research is essential to advance our
                    understanding of the biodiversity and ecosystem function of the deep
                    Mediterranean and to provide sound scientific data that enable policy makers and
                    stakeholders to develop conservation and management options. Prokaryotic diversity has been investigated using molecular approaches that
                    include a wide range of techniques, among them fingerprinting methods such as
                    ARISA or T-RFLP, which reflect the richness and community composition of the
                    dominant components of the assemblage in large sets of samples [88],
                        [100], [265] and the cloning
                    and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes, which also provide information on the
                    phylogenetic identity of dominant members [96], [193].
                    ARISA and T-RFLP analyses were carried out as described, respectively, by
                    Danovaro et al. [97] and Luna et al. [88], [100].
                    Clone libraries were created from bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes amplified by
                    PCR (polymerase chain reaction) with the universal bacterial primers 27f
                    (modified to match also Planctomycetales; 5′-AGRGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3′) and 1492r
                        (5′-GGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′); details are
                    provided in [89], [95], [96]. The obtained sequences were used for
                    phylogenetic analysis with the ARB software. The extracts were further used for
                    sequencing. Similarity matrices among the sequences of the clones were
                    calculated to identify the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were further
                    used to estimate species richness (Chao-1) using the Web-based rarefaction
                    calculator software (http://www2.biology.ualberta.ca./jbrzusto/rarefact.php). A variety of sampling gear has been used to collect samples for the study of
                    deep-sea Foraminifera [266]. Earlier studies were based on samples
                    obtained using grabs, gravity cores, or piston cores, which do not retain the
                    surface sediment where living Foraminifera are concentrated [76],
                        [78], [80] (see Text S1 for
                    additional references). Subsequently, box cores have been used [79],
                        [86], [267]. Recent studies
                    have been based on high-quality multicorer samples [82]–[84].
                    Pancotti (unpublished) included soft-shelled monothalamous species in her study
                    of samples from the Eastern and Western Mediterranean. All other authors have
                    confined themselves to hard-shelled species and therefore have not encompassed
                    the full range of foraminiferal biodiversity in the deep Mediterranean. Some
                    important papers [87] only report counts for selected species. In
                    early studies, samples were not treated with Rose Bengal and therefore yielded
                    “total” assemblages, that is, a mixture of
                    “live” and “dead” tests. We have
                    included some such studies [78], [80] because they are
                    particularly relevant to this synthesis. All other samples were stained with
                    Rose Bengal to distinguish between Foraminifera that were alive when collected
                    and those that were dead. Sieve mesh size is a crucial variable that strongly
                    influences assemblage composition. In the Mediterranean the following meshes
                    have been used: 32, 63, 125, and 150 µm. A final point to consider is
                    that geologists, who published most of the data available, are less interested
                    in diversity than biologists, and species lists are therefore often incomplete
                    or do not differentiate species in “difficult” genera such
                    as Fissurina, Lagena,
                        Bolivina, Brizalina, and
                        Lenticulina. The outcome of these predominately
                    geologically orientated studies is an inconsistent body of data that cannot be
                    easily integrated to produce an overall synthesis of community parameters. We
                    therefore focus our analyses mainly on data from single papers. The dataset on nematode diversity (Species Richness) consists of 161 samples (new
                    and literature data) collected with multicores and box cores in different
                    ecosystems (open slope, canyon, rise, seamount, and deep basin) along the entire
                    deep Mediterranean Sea from the western to the eastern basin at depths ranging
                    from 204 m to 4,000 m [57], [59], [61],
                        [64], [68], [148],
                        [170]. Data on nematode species composition were
                    obtained from a subset of 143 samples. For diversity, Meiofauna were extracted
                    according to the standard protocols. All the meiobenthic animals were counted
                    and classified per taxon under a stereomicroscope after staining with Rose
                    Bengal (0.5 g L−1). For Nematoda identification, specimens
                    were mounted on slides (following the formalin-ethanol-glycerol technique to
                    prevent dehydration) and identified to species level according to the recent
                    literature dealing with new nematode genera and species (see Text S1 for
                    more references). Deep-sea Macrofauna has been typically sampled using a modified Agassiz benthic
                    trawl (2.3 m wide and 0.9 m high), a 14.76 m Marinovich-type deep-water trawl
                    (codend mesh 6 mm) with a 0.5 mm plankton net secured on top, a sled for
                    suprabenthic Macrofauna, and different types and sizes of box corers, depending
                    on the depth considered and the research teams. A 0.062 m2 box corer
                    with an effective penetration of 40 cm (Ocean Instruments model 700 AL) has been
                    used in the Levantine Sea. The samples are typically preserved in 10%
                    buffered formalin aboard ship. In the laboratory, samples were washed and sieved
                    through 250 µm mesh. Deep-sea Megafauna has been sampled in the Western Mediterranean by different
                    methods, depending on the depth considered. Slope Megafauna has been sampled
                    from commercial trawlers using bottom otter trawls down to 700–800 m
                    depth. These commercial trawls have horizontal mouth openings of 20–25
                    m and 3–5 m of vertical opening, with a 40 mm stretched mesh in the
                    codend liner, and are trawled over the seafloor at about 3 knots [48],
                        [134]. Rucabado et al. [268] were the first
                    researchers to use the otter semiballoon trawl gear (OTSB: 8 m horizontal spread
                    and 0.8 vertical mouth opening) in the Mediterranean. This sampling device was
                    subsequently transformed into the otter trawl Maireta System (OTMS: 12 m
                    horizontal spread and 1.4 m vertical opening approximately) [54]. The
                    OTMS is equipped with SCANMAR sensors that provide information on bottom contact
                    time and vertical and horizontal opening of the trawl's mouth down to
                    1,500 m depth, allowing calculation of sampled area [47]–[49],
                        [108], [115], [116],
                        [128], [129].
                    Furthermore, the Agassiz trawl has been commonly used to sample the deep Western
                    and Eastern Mediterranean benthos since the late 1980s [50], [53],
                        [71]. In the Balearic Sea, approximately 350 hauls
                    have been made, covering no more than 7–8 km2 over an area
                    of about 9,000 km2 (i.e., only 0.08% of the Balearic slope
                    below 1,000 m has been directly sampled, 40% after year 2000). A
                    total of 174 trawl hauls from a series of 24 cruises conducted between 1988 and
                    2004 off the coast of Israel, at depths between 720 and 1,558 m, were analyzed.
                    The samples were collected aboard the RV Shikmona (720 HP; 27
                    m), using a modified Agassiz trawl (2.3 m width and 0.9 m height), a 14,76 m
                    deep-water trawl (Marinovich-type, codend mesh 6 mm) with a 0.5 mm plankton net
                    secured on top. Deep-water Megafauna species have been collected in the central-eastern
                    Mediterranean since the Pola, Thor, and
                        Dana (see Text S1 for more references) expeditions. An
                    important contribution to our knowledge of Megafauna was provided by
                    professional fishing and further explorations using dredge and trawl [34]
                    (see Text
                        S1 for more references). Most data on the slope Megafauna were
                    acquired using bottom otter trawl gear down to 700–800 m depth during
                    Italian GRUND [269] and international MEDITS [270]
                    study projects carried out since 1985 in the Italian seas and 1994 in the
                    northern Mediterranean, respectively. Commercial motor-powered vessels, equipped
                    with an otter trawl net, with stretched mesh of 40 mm in the codend, were hired
                    during GRUND surveys, while a specially designed net with a stretched mesh of 20
                    mm in the codend was used during the MEDITS cruises. The collection of
                    information on the Megafauna in waters deeper than 800 m using otter trawl gears
                    has been carried out during some EU and regional projects. In particular, during
                    the EU-DESEAS project, sampling was conducted with the otter trawl Maireta
                    System (OTMS) using the RV Garcia del Cid (1,500 HP, 38 m;
                        [46]). During INTERREG Italy-Greece, a depth range
                    between 300 m and 1,200 m was examined using two hired commercial trawlers
                    equipped with bottom trawl net with a codend mesh size of 40 mm (stretched)
                        [117], [271]–[273]. During the EU-RESHIO project a commercial
                    bottom trawler towing an Italian-type fishing net of 40 mm (stretched) was used.
                    The sampling design was randomly stratified by depth between 300 m and 900 m
                        [271], [274]. During the
                    regional project GAVIS, the sampling was conducted using a professional
                    motor-powered vessel equipped with an experimental otter trawl Maireta net, used
                    with double warps. The stretched mesh in the codend was 20 mm. The sampling
                    design adopted was random-stratified according to the following depth strata:
                    400–600 m; 600–800 m; 800–1,000 m;
                    1,000–1,200 m. The hauls were allocated in each depth stratum in
                    proportion to their surface area [275]. During the
                    regional Spanish project RETRO, sampling of Megafauna was conducted using the
                    OTMS [44], [129], and during
                    the regional Spanish project RECS, sampling was conducted using multicores for
                    Meiofauna, epibenthic sledge for suprabenthos Macrofauna, and OTMS for Megafauna
                        [48]. The diversity of the different components was reported as (a) Species Richness
                    (SR), the total number of species or operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
                    identified in each sample, (b) Shannon-Wiener information function
                    (H′, using log base 2), and (c) Margalef's index:
                        (D = (S−1)/ln
                        N), where S is the number of species and
                        N is the number of individuals in the sample. To
                    standardize the values of diversity estimated using a different number of
                    individuals [276], the species-abundance data were used to
                    calculate rarefied species richness ES(51 and 100) as the expected number of
                    species for a theoretical sample of 51 and 100 specimens, respectively [6],
                        [8], [61], [62],
                        [170]. The equitability of benthic assemblages was
                    estimated as Pielou's index (evenness J′). The turnover
                    diversity (as % Bray-Curtis dissimilarity; [277]) was estimated as
                    the dissimilarity in species composition at different depths and longitudes
                    toward the SIMPER analysis (based on the Bray-Curtis similarity index). ANOSIM
                    analysis was used to test the presence of statistical differences in the species
                    composition among different assemblages. SIMPER and ANOSIM analyses were
                    performed using PRIMER v5 (Plymouth Marine Laboratory, UK). The meta-analyses, performed on the entire dataset of this synthesis, were based
                    on two diversity indices: Species Richness and the Expected Species Number for
                    100 individuals estimated for each component (data for Prokaryotes,
                    Foraminifera, Meiofauna, Macrofauna and Megafauna are summarized in Tables S1,
                        S2,
                        S3,
                        S4,
                        S5
                    and in [43]). Since species richness is strongly affected
                    by the sample size, to standardize the values of diversity estimated for each
                    benthic component using different sampling efforts, the expected number of
                    species for a theoretical sample of 100 specimens (ES(100)) was selected. Only
                    for bacterial and archaeal OTU richness data, the ES(100) was not estimated due
                    to the fact that it is not possible to convert OTU richness data in ES(100). All
                    data for Foraminifera, Meiofauna, Macrofauna, and Megafauna have been
                    standardized using the rarefaction curves in which the same number of specimens
                    were used to estimated the diversity for each benthic component. For
                    Prokaryotes, the rarefaction curves were estimated only for diversity data
                    obtained using 16S rDNA sequences. The total number of expected species, the
                    total number of unknown expected species, and the relative contribution of the
                    unknown expected species on the total diversity for Foraminifera, Meiofauna (as
                    Nematoda), Macrofauna, and Megafauna were estimated using the equations of the
                    rarefaction curves, whereas the details on the estimates of area per bathymetric
                    range and the average abundance of each component were summarized in the
