   Multidrug-resistant bacteria are the cause of an increasing number of deadly
                    pulmonary infections. Because there is currently a paucity of novel antibiotics,
                    phage therapy—the use of specific viruses that infect bacteria—is
                    now more frequently being considered as a potential treatment for bacterial
                    infections. Using a mouse lung-infection model caused by a multidrug resistant
                        Pseudomonas aeruginosa mucoid strain isolated from a cystic
                    fibrosis patient, we evaluated bacteriophage treatments. New bacteriophages were
                    isolated from environmental samples and characterized. Bacteria and
                    bacteriophages were applied intranasally to the immunocompetent mice. Survival
                    was monitored and bronchoalveolar fluids were analysed. Quantification of
                    bacteria, bacteriophages, pro-inflammatory and cytotoxicity markers, as well as
                    histology and immunohistochemistry analyses were performed. A curative treatment
                    (one single dose) administrated 2 h after the onset of the infection allowed
                    over 95% survival. A four-day preventive treatment (one single dose)
                    resulted in a 100% survival. All of the parameters measured correlated
                    with the efficacy of both curative and preventive bacteriophage treatments. We
                    also showed that in vitro optimization of a bacteriophage
                    towards a clinical strain improved both its efficacy on in vivo
                    treatments and its host range on a panel of 20 P. aeruginosa
                    cystic fibrosis strains. This work provides an incentive to develop clinical
                    studies on pulmonary bacteriophage therapy to combat multidrug-resistant lung
                    infections. Citation: Morello E, Saussereau E, Maura D, Huerre M, Touqui L, Debarbieux L (2011) Pulmonary Bacteriophage Therapy on Pseudomonas

                responsible for hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia as well as
                ventilator-associated pneumonia, and the first causative agent of morbidity and
                mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients [1], [2]. Although antibiotics are still
                an effective means of treating bacterial lung infections, the alarming rise of
                multidrug-resistant bacteria in hospitals has highlighted the need for new therapies
                    [3], [4], [5].
                Bacteriophages —viruses infecting bacteria— have been proposed to treat
                human bacterial infections since their discovery in the early 20th century [6], [7]. However, after
                a short period of development, the advent of antibiotics led to this therapeutic
                approach being abandoned, except in Eastern Europe where bacteriophages are still
                used today to treat patients [8], [9], [10]. During the past 20 years, studies in animal models have
                demonstrated the potential of bacteriophages [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. Recently the first phase II
                clinical trial performed under European regulations on bacteriophage treatments of
                chronic otitis was published, and demonstrated the interest of using bacteriophages
                on multidrug resistant infections [16]. The effects of bacteriophage therapy on lung infections
                has only very recently been addressed in animal models [14], [17]. On the one hand, a proof of
                concept with a bioluminescent strain of P. aeruginosa showed that
                bacteriophages administrated intranasally had a rapid efficacy with respect to
                preventing and curing deadly lung infections [14]. On the other hand, a
                clinical strain of Burkholderia cenocepacia isolated from a CF
                patient was used to show that the intraperitoneal administration of bacteriophages
                was more effective than intranasal applications in a non-deadly infectious model
                    [17]. Here we
                report an in-depth evaluation of the efficacy of curative and preventive
                bacteriophage treatments of lung infections using a multidrug resistant mucoid
                    P. aeruginosa strain isolated from a CF patient of Grenoble
                hospital, France [18], [19]. For this study we specifically optimized the virulence
                of a bacteriophage of our collection towards this clinical strain and studied its
                efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. To investigate bacteriophage treatments on a mouse lung-infection caused by a
                    clinical P. aeruginosa strain named CHA [18], [19], we first established
                    the conditions in which an intranasal administration of this strain was lethal.
                    We found that inoculation of 3×106 bacteria was sufficient to
                    induce death in 100% of animals within 2 days (Figure 1A). Progress of the infection was
                    assessed by quantification of bacteria, inflammatory markers, and cytotoxicity
                    levels at 20 h post-infection (Figures 1 and 2). The number of bacteria in the lungs had increased at least by two
                    orders of magnitude compared with the initial infectious dose (over
                        4×108 cfu were found in the broncho-alveolar lavages
                    [BAL] form each infected mouse compared with the infectious dose of
                        3×106 cfu; Figure 1C). The levels of two pro-inflammatory markers (cytokines
                    IL-6 and KC) as well as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) which reflects organ
                    toxicity, were highly elevated (Figure 2). Histological analysis, also at 20 h post-infection,
                    revealed severe lesions consistent with acute pneumopathy, combined with focal
                    and diffuse alveolitis and bronchitis, consolidation and necrosis (Figure 3A compared to Figure 3D from uninfected
                    animals). Disease severity was scored at 16 out of 25 (Figure 3M). These findings confirmed that the
                    clinical P. aeruginosa strain CHA is able rapidly to infect
                    lungs and induce severe damage leading to death in these mice.  (A–B) Survival curves of mice infected with the CHA
                            strain and treated or pre-treated with P3-CHA bacteriophage.
                                (A) PBS (♦), 3×106 (•) and
                                3×107 (□) pfu of bacteriophage were given
                            intranasally 2 h after bacteria (3×106 cfu) were
                            administered. This curative treatment appears to be dose dependent
                            (P<0.0001 for both bacteriophage doses compared to PBS and P<0.01
                            between 3×106 and 3×107 bacteriophage
                            doses). (B) Four days before infection with
                                3×106 bacteria, mice were given either
                                3×107 (•), or 3×108 (□)
                            pfu of P3-CHA or 3×108 pfu of heat-inactivated P3-CHA
                            solution (♦). These survival curves indicate that the preventative
                            treatment is dose dependent (P<0.0005 and P<0.0001 for
                                3×107 and 3×108 bacteriophage
                            doses respectively compared to heat-inactivated bacteriophage solution
                            and P<0.0005 between 3×107 and
                                3×108 bacteriophage doses).
                            (C–D) 20 h after infection with strain CHA, mice were
                            euthanized and BAL fluids were assayed for bacteria (C) and
                            bacteriophages (D). In the curative treatment protocols,
                            mice were treated with PBS or bacteriophage 2 h post infection (phage 2
                            h pi). In the preventative treatment protocols, mice were intranasally
                            administered bacteriophage solution (4d phage) or heat-inactivated
                            bacteriophage solution (4d phage 80°C) four days before infection.
                                (C) Bacterial counts were significantly lower in the
                            BAL fluids from mice that had received either curative or preventative
                            bacteriophage treatment than the respective control treatment (*
                            P<0.05, and ** P<0.01). (D) Bacteriophage
                            counts were significantly lower in the BAL fluids from mice that had
                            received bacteriophage treatment than the non-infected animals
                            (** P<0.01) or the non-infected animals pre-treated four days
                            earlier with the bacteriophage P3-CHA (* P<0.05). 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016963.g001  (A–C) 20 h after infection with strain CHA, mice were
                            euthanized and BAL fluids were assayed for cytokines (A and
                                B) and LDH (C). In the curative treatment
                            protocols, mice were treated with PBS or bacteriophage (phage 2 h pi) 2
                            h post infection. In the preventative treatment protocols, mice were
                            intranasally administered bacteriophage solution (4d phage) or
                            heat-inactivated bacteriophage solution (4d phage 80°C) four days
                            before infection. IL-6 (A), KC (B)
                            concentrations in BAL fluids from mice that had received either curative
                            or preventative bacteriophage treatments were significantly lower than
                            the values for their respective controls untreated animals
                                ((A) * P<0.05, (B) * P<0.05)

                            P<0.01). LDH (C) levels were significantly reduced only
                            in mice that had received a curative treatment (* P<0.05).

              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016963.g002  (A–D; scale bar 200 µm) Thin sections of lungs
                            obtained after 20 h from, (A) mice infected with the CHA
                            strain, (B) infected mice treated with bacteriophage
                            P3-CHA, (C) mice pre-treated with bacteriophage P3-CHA four
                            days before infection, and (D) uninfected mice were stained
                            with hematoxylin-eosin and Gram. Histological analyses included the
                            determination of a lesion severity score (see materials and methods) to allow comparison
                                (M). This score was significantly lower for mice given
                            curative or preventive bacteriophage treatments than for untreated mice
                            (* P<0.05). (E–L) Immunohistochemistry was performed
                                with anti-Pseudomonas antibodies on sections
                                obtained from the same samples as above (E–H;
                                scale bar 100 µm and I–L; scale bar 50
                                µm). In lung sections from infected mice, bacteria are both
                                intracellular and extracellular (E and I)
                                whereas no signal can be seen in lung sections from uninfected mice
                                    (H and L). The signal was lower
                                following either curative (F and J) or
                                preventive (G and K) bacteriophage treatments and
                                        bacteria were only observed in macrophage
                                    cells. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016963.g003 We screened our collection of natural P. aeruginosa
                    bacteriophages (initially isolated from the environment using the P.
                        aeruginosa strain PAK [14]) and found that the
                    PAK-P3 bacteriophage was able to establish a moderate infection in strain CHA
                    (plating efficiency of 10% compared with 100% on the PAK strain).
                    After five consecutive passages in liquid culture with the CHA strain we
                    obtained a bacteriophage stock that showed the same plating efficiency on both
                    CHA and PAK strains. Subsequently, four steps of plaque purification were
                    performed to obtain a preparation of a single isolated phage that we named
                    P3-CHA (see Materials and Methods).
                    Electron microscopy showed that both bacteriophages (PAK-P3 and P3-CHA) belong
                    to the Myoviridae family of bacterial viruses (Figure 4). Their genomes were sequenced
                    (Genbank accession numbers: HM173082 for PAK-P3, and HM173081 for P3-CHA) and
                    analysed revealing that they are distantly related to the PAK-P1 bacteriophage
                        [14].
                    Major capsid proteins were identified by mass spectrometry (Figure 4). Putative proteins encoded by their
                    genomes were analysed and no significant similarities to proteins considered to
                    be markers of temperate bacteriophages or toxins were identified (see Materials and Methods). This confirmed that
                    both PAK-P3 (vB_PaeM_PAK_P3) and P3-CHA (vB_PaeM_P3_CHA) are virulent
                    bacteriophages. We estimated the host range of these two bacteriophages with a
                    set of 20 clinical CF strains (Table 1). The P3-CHA bacteriophage was overall more efficient than
                    PAK-P3 on infecting P. aeruginosa strains isolated from both
                    primary and chronically infected patients.  (A, C) Electron micrographs of PAK-P3

                            the database with known function (the major capsid protein of Felix 01
                            bacteriophage; NP_944891). Major capsid proteins of PAK-P3 and P3-CHA
                            are 100% identical.

              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016963.t001 We administered two different doses of P3-CHA bacteriophage intranasally
                    (mimicking a nebulisation treatment for humans) to two groups of mice that had
                    received a lethal dose of the CHA strain 2 h earlier and followed their survival
                        (Figure 1A). Both doses
                    of bacteriophage improved survival and the high dose (3×108
                    pfu) was associated with a greater rate of survival than the low dose
                        (3×107 pfu) throughout the experiment (16 days). Twenty
                    hours after inoculation (i.e. 18 h after bacteriophage
                    treatment was given) we quantified bacteria, bacteriophages, cytokines, and LDH,
                    as well as performing histological analyses. In the group treated with the high
                    dose, the number of bacteria was over two orders of magnitude lower than in the
                    untreated group (Figure 1C),
                    and the number of bacteriophages was ten times higher (Figure 1D). Cytokines and LDH (Figure 2) concentrations were
                    markedly lower in the bacteriophage-treated group than in the untreated group.
                    Histological analyses confirmed that lung damage in the treated group was less
                    severe than in the untreated animals. In the bacteriophage-treated mice,
                    moderate or mild lesions of alveolitis and bronchitis were observed without
                    necrosis or consolidation; in a blind protocol, the severity of these
                    histological lesions was scored at 5 out of 25 (Figure 3B and M). Immunohistochemistry, using
                    a polyclonal anti-Pseudomonas antibody, detected only a few
                    bacteria (entire cells or debris) in bacteriophage-treated animals, mainly in
                    the cytoplasm of macrophages in the lungs (Figure 3F and J). In contrast, bacteria were
                    detected in macrophages, alveolae, and extracellular spaces of the lungs from
                    untreated animals (Figure 3E and
                        I). No signal was detected in uninfected animals (Figure 3H and L). These
                    observations are consistent with the fact that bacteriophages target only
                    extracellular bacteria and also show the role of phagocytosis in bacterial
                    removal. These experiments indicate that a curative bacteriophage treatment acts
                    cooperatively with the immune response to eliminate acute lung infection caused
                    by a CF strain of P. aeruginosa. We also used survival-curve analysis to assess the curative efficacy of the
                    PAK-P3 parental bacteriophage (used in the same conditions as P3-CHA, Figure 5). After 8 days, only
                    20% of treated mice had survived. Thus, the in vivo
                    protection in this model correlated with in vitro plating
                    efficiency, as previously hypothesised [14]. Moreover the
                        in vivo advantage of P3-CHA appears to be only due to two
                    single nucleotide changes in the entire genome, highlighting the plasticity of
                    the bacteriophage genomes to rapidly increase their infectivity to new hosts
                    (see Materials and Methods).  Mice were infected intranasally with 3×106 cfu (CHA
                            strain) and 2 h later were treated with either PBS (♦) or
                                3×107 pfu of bacteriophage PAK-P3 (•), or
                                3×107 pfu of bacteriophage P3-CHA (□) also
                            administered intranasally (P<0.005 for both P3-CHA and PAK-P3
                            bacteriophage doses compared to PBS and P<0.05 between P3-CHA and
                            PAK-P3 bacteriophage doses). 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016963.g005 To determine whether the P3-CHA bacteriophage could be used to prevent an
                    infection by the CHA strain, we prepared an endotoxin-free bacteriophage
                    solution (see Materials and Methods). This
                    reduced the possibility of stimulating an immune response in the host, which
                    could mask the effects of bacteriophage treatment. We first determined the rate
                    of elimination of the P3-CHA bacteriophage from the lungs of uninfected mice and
                    found that its concentration decreased by slightly more than half-log/day (over
                    500 fold decrease between day 0 and day 4, Figure 6). Only 20% of animals given
                        3×107 bacteriophages four days prior to infection with
                        3×106 bacteria were protected whereas 100% of the
                    animals given 3×108 bacteriophages were protected (Figure 1B). 100% of the
                    animals pre-treated 4 days before infection with the equivalent of
                        3×108 pfu of heat-killed P3-CHA solution died within 2 days
                        (Figure 1B), showing
                    that an active bacteriophage is required. Twenty hours after infection of a
                    group of mice pre-treated with P3-CHA bacteriophage (3×108 pfu)
                    four days earlier, animals were euthanized to perform histological analyses and
                    to quantify bacteria, bacteriophages, cytokines, and LDH. Bacterial counts were
                    lower in P3-CHA pre-treated mice than in heat-killed P3-CHA pre-treated mice
                        (Figure 1C).
                    Bacteriophage counts were higher in P3-CHA pre-treated mice than in non-infected
                    P3-CHA pre-treated mice (Figure
                        1D). Cytokine concentrations were also significantly lower for P3-CHA
                    pre-treated mice, whereas LDH concentrations were similar in both groups (Figure 2). Furthermore the
                    level of both active and heat-inactivated solutions of bacteriophage gave rise
                    to identically low levels of pro-inflammatory markers (Figure 2). Histological analyses showed that
                    lung damage was markedly less severe in P3-CHA pre-treated mice than the
                    controls, with histological lesions being scored at 7 out of 25 (Figure 3C and M).
                    Immuno-histochemistry of lungs from mice that were pre-treated with P3-CHA
                    bacteriophages showed a pattern that was similar to curative treatment.
                    Bacterial antigens were detected only in the cytoplasm of alveolar macrophages
                        (Figure 3G and K). These
                    data confirmed the efficacy of the preventive bacteriophage treatment.  Three groups of five mice were given 3×108 pfu of
                            bacteriophage P3-CHA, administered intranasally. The number of
                            bacteriophages in BAL fluids was determined 1, 4 and 5 days
                            post-administration (n = 5). 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016963.g006 A clinical strain of P. aeruginosa isolated from a CF patient was
                used to evaluate bacteriophage curative and preventive treatments on a lung
                infection model. Both treatments successfully rescued mice from lethal infections,
                underlying the potential use of bacteriophages to combat lung pathogens. We also
                showed that pro-inflammatory and cytotoxicity markers, as well as histology
                observations, were all concordant with these results for survival. Moreover, we observed that bacterial debris released during bacteriophage treatments
                were not pro-inflammatory, as production of cytokines was not strongly stimulated in
                either the curative or the preventive treatments. A pro-inflammatory response is
                often used as an argument against phage therapy. Four days after administration of
                the preventative treatment that consisted of intranasal bacteriophage solution only,
                the lung concentrations of IL-6 and KC were low (Figure 2A and B). The main cause of bacterial
                destruction can therefore be attributed to the bacteriophage itself. However, the
                cytokine concentrations were still significantly higher than those measured 24 h
                after administration of a PBS control solution, and partial involvement of a weak
                immune response stimulated by the bacteriophage solution cannot thus be ruled out.
                Indeed, the quality of the bacteriophage preparation, particularly the elimination
                of endotoxins, influenced the extent of the immune response following pre-infection
                treatments (data not shown). This is in contrast to post-infection treatments, where
                the immune system has already been primed by bacteria when the bacteriophages were
                administered. Humans are constantly exposed to bacterial viruses —an estimated
                    1031 are on the Earth [20]—but little is known about the immunological
                consequences of this. Recently, a metagenomic analysis of viral DNA present in the
                lungs of CF patients identified over 100 different viral genomes, and this was
                considered to be a low diversity compared with other environments [21]. Nevertheless,
                the role of the immune system in shaping viral diversity has yet to be deeply
                studied. Furthermore, the immune response to therapeutic bacteriophages has not been
                extensively investigated because most of the available data were obtained from model
                viruses which have little interest as therapeutic agents [22], [23], [24]. Bacteriophage treatments of P. aeruginosa chronic lung infections in
                animal models have still not been investigated, and no specific procedure has been
                developed to isolate bacteriophages with higher infectivity against chronic clinical
                strains. However, several lines of evidence are encouraging. First, some
                bacteriophages are known to possess hydrolases that degrade bacterial
                exopolysaccharides [13], [25]. Second, several in vitro biofilm models
                have shown that bacteriophages can access and infect bacteria grown under these
                conditions [26], [27]. Third, mucus
                overproduction could be controlled or reduced as recently shown using a cPLA2α
                inhibitor [28].
                Fourth, our study suggests that the use of bacteriophages devoid of endotoxins
                should not induce a strong stimulation of the pro-inflammatory markers. Finally, optimization of bacteriophages can extend their host ranges. In the present
                study, full sequencing of the optimized bacteriophage revealed that only two single
                nucleotide mutations are sufficient to improve its virulence towards a clinical
                strain. This indicates the advantages of rapid bacteriophage evolution over
                conventional drugs that can take months if not years to optimize. Besides the present study, phage therapy on lung infection caused by
                    Burkholderia cenocepacia has also been reported [17]. Although
                there are some dissimilarities, this might be due more to the pathogens than to the
                phage treatments as these two bacteria do not elicit an identical response in the
                host [29], [30]. These studies
                suggest that bacterial lung infections can be treated by bacteriophages as long as
                the bacteria remain accessible (phage therapy is not suitable for intracellular
                bacteria). The preventive treatment appears to be of lesser interest as its clinical application
                might not be as wide as the curative treatment. However it should not be disregarded
                as its efficacy was impressive; a single dose retained efficacy for up to four days.
                The limited clinical application is due to the fact that it is difficult to know in
                advance which bacterial strains will infect an invidual. Nevertheless, some
                individuals—such as CF or immuno-compromized patients— are known to be
                more susceptible to hospital-acquired infections. These infections are sometimes due
                to identified pathogens, as in the case of epidemic strains [31]. As a consequence, as soon
                as an epidemic is identified, such a population of patients could benefit from
                preventive treatments to reduce the probability of becoming infected. Bacteriophages should not be considered only as a stand-alone treatment. Their use in
                combination with already approved treatments (like antibiotics) will be most likely
                the best form of application. Experimental, clinical, and regulatory data of such
                combined treatments are now urgently needed since antibiotic resistance is still
                rising [5]. Together with our previous work, we have now demonstrated that two different
                bacteriophages administrated intranasally are effective in treating lung infections
                with two different bacterial strains of P. aeruginosa. This extends
                our knowledge concerning the use of bacterial viruses in the treatment of pulmonary
                infections. Animals were housed in the Institut Pasteur animal facilities accredited by the
                    French Ministry of Agriculture to perform experiments on live mice, in appliance
                    of the French and European regulations on care and protection of the Laboratory
                    Animals. Protocols were approved by the veterinary staff of the Institut Pasteur
                    animal facility (approval ID 10.565). The CHA strain was cultivated at 37°C in LB medium with shaking and prepared
                    as previously described [14]. The CHA strain is resistant to tetracyclin,
                    chloramphenicol, ampicilin, streptomycin, nalidixic acid, spectinomycin,
                    erythromycin and rifampicin and shows an intermediate level of resistance to
                    gentamycin and ticarcillin [18], [19]. The 20 clinical CF
                    strains were provided by P. Plésiat, Besançon, France. Bacteriophage PAK-P3 was isolated from sewage water as previously described [14]. To
                    adapt the PAK-P3 bacteriophage to the CHA strain, a liquid culture of the CHA
                    strain was infected with PAK-P3 (MOI of 1/1000) and incubated at 37°C with
                    shaking. After 4 hours, the culture, showing signs of lysis, was stopped by
                    adding few drops of chloroform. The culture was then centrifuged at 8000 g for
                    10 min, and the supernatant was stored at 4°C before use in the next round
                    of amplification. This was repeated five times and the final supernatant was
                    diluted and plated onto a Petri dish overlaid with the CHA stain. A few
                    individual plaques were picked and resuspended in SM buffer (10 mM Tris HCl pH7,
                    200 mM NaCl, 0.03% gelatine) and subsequently used for four cycles of
                    plaque purification. A final set of 10 isolated plaques were chosen and tested
                    for their host range against a set of 20 CF strains of P.
                        aeruginosa by spotting serial dilutions of bacteriophages on
                    bacterial lawns. Each of the 10 isolated plaques showed the same host range, and
                    one was chosen and named bacteriophage P3-CHA. Liquid cultures of 1 litre were
                    used for large-scale preparation of PAK-P3 and P3-CHA using caesium chloride
                    ultracentrifugation as described by Boulanger [32]. Bacteriophage solutions
                    obtained were diluted in PBS for the curative treatment. Before use for the
                    preventive treatment bacteriophage solutions were passed five times through an
                    endotoxin-removal column (EndoTrap blue, Hyglos, Germany). The endotoxin-free
                    bacteriophage solution contained 1×10−10 endotoxin units
                    per pfu which correspond to 0.02UE per mice for the highest dose of
                    bacteriophage given (1×108 pfu in 50 µl). This value is
                    over 100 fold inferior to the limited value accepted in Europe for bacterial
                    endotoxins contamination of products that are administrated intraveneously (5.0
                    UE/kg body mass/hour; European Pharmacopoeia 5.0, 2005). Endotoxin
                    concentrations were determined using the QCL-1000® Chromogenic LAL endpoint
                    assay (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD, USA). Heat-inactivated bacteriophage solution was obtained by a 10 min incubation at
                    80°C. Inability of heated bacteriophage to form plaque on bacterial lawns
                    was checked. Electron microscopy observations were performed on a Jeol 1200 EXII microscope
                    after uranyl acetate staining of caesium chloride bacteriophage preparations
                        [33]. Serial dilutions of bacteriophages PAK-P3 and P3-CHA were spotted on bacterial
                    lawns for each of the 20 clinical strains. Efficacy of plating was calculated by
                    comparison with an efficacy of 100% for respectively the PAK-P3
                    bacteriophage on the PAK strain and the P3-CHA bacteriophage on the CHA
                    strain. Genome sequencing (20 to 25× coverage) was performed by Eurofins and
                    Beckman Coulter Genomics using 454 technology with DNA prepared by standard
                    procedures. The complete genome sequences of the PAK-P3 (vB_PaeM_PAK_P3) and
                    P3-CHA (vB_PaeM_P3_CHA) bacteriophages are accessible in Genbank (accession
                    numbers HM173082 and HM173081, respectively). Sequence analysis to search for
                    temperate bacteriophage markers (similar genes) was performed on the PAK-P3
                    genome as described previously [14]. PAK-P3 and P3-CHA
                    genomes were compared to search for mutations using Blast2seq tool. Two
                    mutations were found in putative orfs 13 and 151 (nucleotide 7393 changed from A
                    to G and nucleotide 69922 changed from G to A) leading to amino-acid
                    substitutions Q to R and E to K, respectively in these two hypothetical
                    proteins. Total bacteriophage proteins were run on an SDS gel and subjected to in-gel
                    trypsin digestion; microsequencing of the major capsid proteins was then
                    performed by the Institut Pasteur microsequencing facility. None of the peptide
                    sequences corresponded to any protein sequences in the databank before inclusion
                    of our bacteriophage sequence data. Mice (8 weeks old Balb/c males) were supplied by the Centre d'élevage
                    R. Janvier. Food and drink were provided ad libitum. Animal infections and
                    treatments were performed as described previously [14]. Bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL; 4×0.5 ml) were performed 20 h after infection
                    following pentobarbital euthanasia (300 mg/kg). One aliquot of the BAL fluids
                    was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1400 rpm and murine cytokine concentrations
                    were determined using DuoSet ELISA kits from R&D Systems. LDH activity was
                    estimated using the Cytotox96 kit from Promega. The release of LDH in
                    extracellular media reflects organ toxicity. Another aliquot of the BAL fluids
                    was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate free bacteriophages from
                    bacteria. To determine the amount of free bacteriophages, supernatants were
                    diluted and spotted onto plates overlaid with the CHA strain. To determine
                    viable bacterial counts, pellets were resuspended in PBS, serially diluted and
                    plated onto LB agar plates. Lungs were removed from euthanized animals, fixed in 4% buffered formaline
                    for at least 24 h at 4°C, and then embedded in paraffin. Serial 4
                    µm-thick sections were stained with haematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Gram.
                    Histological scoring of elementary lesions of alveolitis, bronchitis, necrosis,
                    and consolidation were scored by an investigator, who was blind to the treatment
                    group, from 0 to 5 (0: none, 1: mild, 2: moderate focal, 3: moderate focal and
                    diffuse, 4: severe focal, 5: severe focal and diffuse extending to the whole
                    lobule). Recruitment of lymphocytes, alveolar macrophages - monocytes and
                    polymorphonuclear cells was similarly evaluated from 0 to 3 (0: no, 1: weak, 2:
                    moderate and 3: severe). Addition of these individual scores gave a
                    lesion-severity score ranging from 0 to 25. Immunohistochemistry of infected
                    lungs was performed with a primary polyclonal anti-Pseudomonas
                    antibody raised in rabbit against the PcrV protein [34]. Affinity-purified
                    antibodies were diluted 1/4000 before use. The method used was a classical
                    Envision Dako protocol performed with amino-ethyl–carbazol as a
                    chromogen. Mantel-Cox tests were performed for survival curves and one-tailed Mann-Whitney
                    paired tests were used to compare quantifications of bacteria, bacteriophages
                    and cytokines. Both were calculated with Prism 4.0 software (France). Error bars
                    are s.e.m. We are grateful to I. Attree-Delic for the gift of anti-Pseudomonas
