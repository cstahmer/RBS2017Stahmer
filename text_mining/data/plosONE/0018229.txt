   Chronic wound infections and antibiotic resistance are driving interest in
                    antimicrobial treatments that have generally been considered complementary,
                    including antimicrobially active honey. Australia has unique native flora and
                    produces honey with a wide range of different physicochemical properties. In
                    this study we surveyed 477 honey samples, derived from native and exotic plants
                    from various regions of Australia, for their antibacterial activity using an
                    established screening protocol. A level of activity considered potentially
                    therapeutically useful was found in 274 (57%) of the honey samples, with
                    exceptional activity seen in samples derived from marri (Corymbia
                        calophylla), jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) and
                    jellybush (Leptospermum polygalifolium). In most cases the
                    antibacterial activity was attributable to hydrogen peroxide produced by the
                    bee-derived enzyme glucose oxidase. Non-hydrogen peroxide activity was detected
                    in 80 (16.8%) samples, and was most consistently seen in honey produced
                    from Leptospermum spp. Testing over time found the hydrogen
                    peroxide-dependent activity in honey decreased, in some cases by 100%,
                    and this activity was more stable at 4°C than at 25°C. In contrast, the
                    non-hydrogen peroxide activity of Leptospermum honey samples
                    increased, and this was greatest in samples stored at 25°C. The stability of
                    non-peroxide activity from other honeys was more variable, suggesting this
                    activity may have a different cause. We conclude that many Australian honeys
                    have clinical potential, and that further studies into the composition and
                    stability of their active constituents are warranted. Citation: Irish J, Blair S, Carter DA (2011) The Antibacterial Activity of Honey Derived from Australian Flora. PLoS ONE 6(3):

                result of its antimicrobial activity and wound healing properties. In particular,
                certain types of honey exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and are
                effective against antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Honey-based wound care products
                have been registered with medical regulatory authorities as wound care agents in
                Australia, Canada, the European Union, Hong Kong, New Zealand and the USA. In most
                instances these products use manuka honey from New Zealand or the equivalent honey
                produced from other Leptospermum species in Australia. Honey has several properties that contribute to its antimicrobial activity. In most
                honeys, low pH and high osmolarity are combined with the enzymatic production of
                hydrogen peroxide that exerts an antimicrobial effect [6], [7]. Phytochemical components derived
                from the floral source of the honey can confer additional activity that is stable in
                the presence of catalase, an enzyme that destroys hydrogen peroxide [8]. This
                non-peroxide activity was first identified in manuka (Leptospermum
                    scoparium) honey from New Zealand where it is often marketed as the
                Unique Manuka Factor (UMF®). Variations in the type and level of antimicrobial activity in honey are associated
                with their floral source. However, while some floral sources appear to be associated
                with particular levels of hydrogen peroxide activity, variation in this activity
                among honeys from within the same floral species has also been observed [9], [10], [11]. This may be due
                to the geographical location of the floral source and the prevailing environmental
                conditions, which affect the physiology of the floral species [12], or to bee-related factors such
                as age or colony health, which may affect the production or activity of glucose
                oxidase (the enzyme responsible for hydrogen peroxide production in honey) [13], [14], [15], [16]. The precise
                mechanisms determining the level of this type of activity are yet to be
                elucidated. Honeys with non-peroxide antimicrobial activity are more closely associated with
                floral source, being generally derived from Leptospermum species
                    [8], [9], although this
                type of activity has also been found in a small number of
                    non-Leptospermum honeys [9], [17], [18], [19]. In a clinical setting where
                honey is used as a topical antimicrobial and wound dressing, non-peroxide activity
                may be advantageous as it is not destroyed by catalase present in body fluids, and
                is unaffected by gamma irradiation [20], allowing these honeys to be sterilized for medicinal
                use. The compound primarily responsible for non-peroxide activity in New Zealand
                manuka honey has recently been identified as methylglyoxal (MG) [21], [22], which is
                derived from dihydroxyacetone, a compound present in high levels in manuka nectar
                    [23]. The
                reasons for varying dihydroxyacetone levels in different plants are not yet
                understood. An agar well diffusion method to determine the antibacterial activity of honey with
                reference to phenol [9] has become the de facto standard in
                medical honey testing, and is used commercially to assign a UMF® value to
                medicinal honeys. This method is a simple and rapid way to screen large numbers of
                honey samples for antibacterial activity; however, it does not discriminate between
                individual antibacterial factors and their relative contributions to overall
                antibacterial activity. Using this method, Allen et al. [9] conducted a
                survey of 345 New Zealand honeys and found wide variation in hydrogen
                peroxide-dependent antibacterial activity, both within and among floral sources.
                Non-peroxide activity was identified in a significant proportion of samples of
                manuka (L. scoparium) and Viper's bugloss (Echium
                    vulgare) honeys. A survey of 179 non-manuka New Zealand honeys by Brady
                    et al. [10] also found wide variation in hydrogen peroxide-dependent
                activity, and non-peroxide activity was not detected in any samples. The only study
                using the phenol equivalence method conducted outside New Zealand is a small survey
                of 30 Portuguese honeys from several floral sources [17]. This study revealed low
                levels of hydrogen peroxide-dependent activity in all samples, and low levels of
                non-peroxide activity in six samples, primarily from Lavandula
                species. Australia is home to diverse and unique floral resources that are exploited by the
                beekeeping industry. No published data exist on the antimicrobial activity of most
                Australian honey, and the benefits of this knowledge to both the apiary industry and
                the health care sector are clear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to survey a
                wide range of Australian honey sourced from different native and exotic flora for
                antimicrobial activity. Honey samples were tested for their levels of total
                antibacterial activity and non-peroxide activity, and correlations were investigated
                between the type and level of antimicrobial activity and the floral source of the
                honey, its region of origin and the age of the honey sample. Over half of the honey
                samples tested had antibacterial activity in the range considered to be
                therapeutically useful. Exceptional hydrogen peroxide-dependent antibacterial
                activity was found in honey derived from Eucalyptus marginata
                (jarrah) and Corymbia calophylla (marri) from Western Australia,
                and very highly active non-peroxide honeys were produced from
                    Leptospermum species, particularly L.
                    polygalifolium, growing in the coastal New South Wales-Queensland
                border region. Although floral source and region were clearly important in the
                production of active honey, the level of activity varied widely among samples and
                changed during storage. A total of 477 honey samples were received from beekeepers and honey companies
                    throughout Australia between March 2005 and June 2007. A map indicating the
                    location of the honey samples is shown in Figure 1. Each sample was assigned a unique
                    reference number and details provided by the beekeepers were entered into a
                    database (see Table S1). Honey samples were stored in glass or plastic containers
                    at room temperature in the dark. Comvita Wound Care 18+ honey (Comvita New
                    Zealand Ltd., Paengaroa, New Zealand), a pure manuka honey from New Zealand with
                    non-peroxide antibacterial activity equivalent to at least 18% phenol was
                    used as a positive control. This honey is commercially available as a wound
                    dressing and is registered with appropriate regulatory bodies in Australia, New
                    Zealand, the USA and the EU.  a) Samples from west Australia (WA = Western

              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0018229.g001 Identification of the floral source of the honey was performed by the beekeepers
                    based on the availability of flora for nectar foraging, location of the apiary
                    and organoleptic characteristics of the honey. Where beekeepers supplied only
                    the common name of the floral source, the scientific name was determined from
                    the Australian Plant Common Name Database [24], Australian Plant Name
                    Index [25]
                    and/or floral distribution maps [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], where possible. Antibacterial activity of honey samples with reference to phenol was determined
                    as described by Allen et al.
                    [9]. An 18 h
                    culture of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144 (Oxoid, Hampshire,
                    UK) grown in tryptone soya broth (TSB; Oxoid) was adjusted to an absorbance of
                    0.5 at 540 nm. Large assay plates (245×245 mm; Corning Inc., Corning, NY,
                    USA) were prepared with 150 ml of nutrient agar (Becton, Dickinson and Company,
                    Sparks, MD, USA) that had been seeded with 100 µl of the prepared
                        S. aureus culture. Plates were stored inverted at 4°C
                    for use the next day, when 64 wells were cut into the agar with a sterile 8 mm
                    diameter cork borer, over a 25 mm grid. Each well was numbered, in duplicate,
                    using a quasi-Latin square that enabled the duplicate samples to be placed
                    randomly on the plate. Honey samples were prepared freshly for each assay by adding 10 ml of sterile
                    deionised water to 10 g of well-mixed honey. One ml of each honey solution was
                    mixed with 1 ml of sterile deionised water for total activity testing, or 1 ml
                    of a freshly prepared 5600 U/ml catalase solution (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) for
                    non-peroxide activity testing. A 100 µl aliquot of each solution was
                    placed in wells of the assay plate, in duplicate. Phenol (BDH, VWR International Ltd., Poole, UK) standards of 2%,
                    3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, and 7% were freshly prepared
                    every four weeks in sterile deionised water and stored at 4°C. Aliquots of
                    100 µl of each solution were placed in duplicate wells of the assay plate.
                    Negative controls of sterile deionised water and catalase solution were included
                    in duplicate wells of each assay plate. Comvita Wound Care 18+ honey was
                    prepared as for other honey samples for use as a positive control. The plates
                    were incubated at 37°C for 18 h. The diameter of each zone of inhibition was measured in two directions at right
                    angles to each other using Vernier callipers. The mean diameter of the zone of
                    inhibition around each well was calculated and squared, and a standard curve was
                    generated of phenol concentration against the mean squared diameter of the zone
                    of inhibition. The activity of each diluted honey sample was calculated using
                    the standard curve. To account for the dilution and density of honey, this
                    figure was multiplied by 4.69 (based on a mean honey density of 1.35 g/ml, as
                    determined by [31]), and the activity of the honey was then expressed as
                    the equivalent phenol concentration (% w/v) [9], [31]. Each honey sample was
                    tested on at least two separate occasions, and the mean phenol equivalence was
                    used in further analysis. A subset of 20 honey samples (10 with hydrogen peroxide activity only and 10 with
                    non-peroxide activity) were selected for retesting following storage of aliquots
                    in the dark at 4°C and at 25°C for 8 to 22 months after the first test.
                    Honey samples were re-tested in duplicate on two separate occasions, and the
                    mean phenol equivalence was used in further analysis. The data consisted of four categorical variables (floral source, floral origin
                    (native, exotic, or mixed), region, sample age), and two main response variables
                    (total activity and non-peroxide activity). All data were analysed
                    qualitatively, with the exception of the change in antibacterial activity over
                    time. Statistical analysis of change in activity over time was performed with
                    Minitab 14 statistical software (Minitab Inc. Pennsylvania, USA), using the
                    Wilcoxon signed ranks test. To aid statistical analysis, honeys with
                    antibacterial activity below the limit of detection of the assay (approximately
                    5% phenol equivalent) were assigned a value of 5, although these values
                    are reported as <5 where appropriate. Comvita Wound Care 18+ honey was used as a positive control to monitor the
                    reproducibility of the phenol equivalence assay. This commercially available
                    product is standardised such that its non-peroxide activity is at least
                    18% (w/v) phenol equivalent. Over the course of this study, the mean
                    total activity of this honey was 17.9±0.9% phenol equivalent, and
                    the mean non-peroxide activity was 17.3±1% phenol equivalent. Day
                    to day variation in activity was within ±2% phenol equivalent of
                    the specified 18%. This range was exceeded on only one occasion and all
                    honey samples in that plate were retested. Replicate tests of individual honey
                    samples were also within the range of ±2% phenol equivalent. Antibacterial activity equivalent to at least 10% (w/v) phenol should
                    provide therapeutic benefits as an antimicrobial [32]. The antibacterial activity
                    of the 477 honey samples was therefore divided into categories of undetectable
                    activity (<5% phenol equivalent), low activity (5–10%
                    phenol equivalent), potentially therapeutically beneficial activity
                    (10–20% phenol equivalent) and high activity (>20% phenol
                    equivalent). The total antibacterial activity (encompassing both hydrogen peroxide-dependent
                    and non-peroxide activity) of the 477 honey samples is shown in Figure 2. The average total
                    activity was 10.6±9.5% phenol equivalent (range: <5–34.3;
                    median: 13). Detectable antibacterial activity was found in 286 (60%) of
                    the honey samples, with an average total activity of 17.8±5%
                    phenol equivalent (range: 7.4–34.3; median: 17.1). A total of 274
                    (57%) of the honey samples had activity of ≥10% phenol
                    equivalent and could be considered to be therapeutically useful.  Graph shows combined peroxide and non-peroxide dependent activity in 477
                            honey samples collected from Australian floral sources, divided into
                            increments of (w/v) phenol equivalent. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0018229.g002 The 477 honey samples were derived from 142 different floral sources, including
                    combinations of known flora, as well as unspecified mixed flora. The majority of
                    honey samples (372 samples = 78%) were derived from
                    native Australian flora; 80 samples (16.8%) were of mixed origin and were
                    likely to contain native floral species; and 25 samples (5.2%) were
                    derived from exotic floral species. Table 1 shows the median antibacterial
                    activity of honeys from floral sources with three or more samples, ranked by
                    median total activity (for activity of all samples see Table
                    S1).  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0018229.t001 Non-peroxide activity was detected in 80 honey samples (16.8%), with a
                    mean of 15.6±4.7% phenol equivalent (range: 8.1–25.9;
                    median: 15.4). A summary of these honeys is shown in Table 2, and a map indicating their floral
                    source and region of origin is shown in Figure 1. Samples that were derived from
                        Leptospermum floral species or contained
                        Leptospermum as part of a mixed floral source comprised
                    77.5% of honey samples with detectable non-peroxide activity (mean
                    non-peroxide activity of Leptospermum-containing honeys:
                    17.2±4.1% phenol equivalent; range: 9.8–25.9; median: 16.4).
                    Eighteen (22.5%) of the honey samples derived from flora other than
                        Leptospermum also exhibited non-peroxide activity (average
                    non-peroxide activity of non-Leptospermum honeys:
                    10.1±1.7% phenol equivalent; range: 8.1–15.9; median: 10).
                    Non-peroxide activity in Leptospermum-containing honeys
                    generally comprised a higher proportion of the total antibacterial activity (up
                    to 100%) than in non-Leptospermum honeys.  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0018229.t002 The non-peroxide antibacterial activity of honey derived from single
                        Leptospermum species is shown in Table 3. Non-peroxide activity was evident in
                    honey from L. polygalifolium, L. liversidgei,
                        L. laevigatum and some unspecified species. These honeys
                    were collected primarily in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales and
                    the adjacent Southeast Coast region of Queensland, with one sample from the
                    Capricornia region of Queensland (Figure 1). Leptospermum honeys collected from other
                    states and regions did not exhibit non-peroxide activity.  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0018229.t003 The majority of honey samples were collected from hives between 2001 and 2007,
                    and tested between 2006 and 2007. No collection date was specified for 66
                    samples, and one sample was collected in 1978. Scatter plots of antibacterial
                    activity vs. sample age for all honeys of known age showed no correlation
                    between antibacterial activity and age of the honey sample
                    (r2 = 0.0062 for total antibacterial activity;
                        r2 = 0.0072 for non-peroxide activity). Aliquots of a subset of 20 honey samples (10 samples with hydrogen
                    peroxide-dependent activity only and 10 samples with non-peroxide activity) were
                    stored in the dark at 25°C and 4°C, and were re-tested between 8 and 22
                    months after first testing (Table
                        4; see Table S2 for the full dataset). Repeat
                    testing found the median total antibacterial activity of honeys exhibiting only
                    hydrogen peroxide-dependent activity significantly decreased over time at both
                    25°C and 4°C (Wilcoxon signed ranks test P<0.01).
                    This loss of activity was significantly greater after storage at 25°C
                    compared to storage at 4°C (Wilcoxon signed ranks test
                    P<0.01). All honeys exhibiting only hydrogen
                    peroxide-dependent activity decreased in activity, with an average of loss of
                    9.5% phenol equivalent, and two samples lost all detectable activity
                    after storage at 25°C. For the 10 samples exhibiting non-peroxide activity,
                    the median total and non-peroxide activity did not change significantly over
                    time at either storage temperature (Wilcoxon signed ranks test
                        P>0.05). However, among these it appeared that the three
                    honey samples derived from pure L. polygalifolium all increased
                    in activity, particularly those stored at 25°C (+16 to +34%
                    change in total activity and +13 to +37% change in non-peroxide
                    activity), while the five samples that were from sources excluding L.
                        polygalifolium showed only very minor increases or decreased in
                    activity during storage (–4 to –34% change in total activity
                    and +2 to –16% change in non-peroxide activity at
                    25°C).  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0018229.t004 The integration of honey into modern medicine as a therapeutic agent requires that
                medicinal honey products exhibit a high level of antimicrobial activity that is
                consistent and standardised, as with any other medicinal product. It is therefore of
                critical importance to the apicultural, horticultural and medical industries to
                identify floral species that give rise to honey with consistently high activity.
                This study is the first to provide a broad overview of the antibacterial activity of
                Australian honey from a wide variety of floral sources. Results show that these
                honeys exhibit a wide range of antibacterial activity, and the majority have
                potential for therapeutic use. Honey with non-peroxide activity is highly sought after in the medicinal honey
                    market due to its potential clinical advantages. This study demonstrates that
                    the prevalence of non-peroxide activity among Australian honey samples, and the
                    level of this activity, exceeds that reported in honey from other countries.
                    Non-peroxide activity was identified in 70.6% of Australian
                        Leptospermum honey samples tested, with a median of
                    16.7% phenol equivalent (Table 2). The methylglyoxal (MG) content of Australian Leptospermum honeys
                    has not yet been investigated, and it is possible that this compound is present
                    in similar or higher levels than in manuka honey. Non-peroxide activity was
                    strongly associated with Leptospermum honeys collected from the
                    Northern Rivers region of New South Wales and the adjacent Southeast Coast
                    region of Queensland (Figure
                        1), indicating that these regions are a potentially valuable source
                    of therapeutically beneficial honey. Among the Leptospermum
                    species, L. polygalifolium (jellybush) produced honey that was
                    particularly high in activity (Table 3). Although L. scoparium (manuka) is the
                    primary source of honey with non-peroxide activity in New Zealand, none of the
                    11 samples of L. scoparium honey from Australia had detectable
                    non-peroxide activity. These findings suggest that environmental conditions in
                    different regions play a role in the relationship between floral source and
                    non-peroxide antibacterial activity, or alternatively that different regions
                    contain as yet uncharacterised subspecies of Leptospermum that
                    are responsible for providing honeys with non-peroxide activity. In New Zealand,
                    different concentrations of phenolic compounds, including MG, are found in
                        L. scoparium honeys collected from different regions, with
                    the potential to affect antibacterial activity [33]. Further botanical and
                    genetic studies of Australian Leptospermum species are required
                    to elucidate these differences, and may inform studies aimed at cultivating
                    particular plant species in productive regions for highly active medicinal
                    honey. Exceptionally high activity was also seen in hydrogen peroxide-dependent honeys
                    derived from marri (C. calophylla; median activity 25.7,
                    maximum 29.7) and jarrah (E. marginata; median activity 25.1,
                    maximum 31.4) from Western Australia. To our knowledge these are the most potent
                    antibacterial honeys yet reported. Very high activity was also seen in
                    22% of honeys from the Sydney metropolitan region, indicating that highly
                    active honey may be obtained from a number of different environments. Although
                    there is a focus in the literature on the antimicrobial activity of
                        Leptospermum honey, many in vitro studies
                    investigating the antimicrobial activity of honey have found that manuka honey
                    and honey with similar levels of hydrogen peroxide activity are equally
                    effective against bacterial pathogens [2], [3], [4], [5], [34], [35], [36]. Honeys with hydrogen
                    peroxide-dependent activity are more effective than manuka honey at inhibiting
                    dermatophyte fungi [37] and species of the yeast Candida
                    [38],
                    indicating that these honeys may be more broad spectrum and valuable as
                    antifungal agents than manuka honey. The antibacterial activity of the Australian honey samples tested exhibited a
                    distinctly bimodal distribution (Figure 2), with peaks at 0–5% and 15–20%
                    (w/v) phenol equivalent. This suggests that the antibacterial activity in fresh
                    honey is largely “all-or-nothing”, although what governs this is not
                    known as there was substantial variation in activity both among and within
                    floral sources. Of the 41 floral sources represented by three or more honey
                    samples, only 6 produced uniformly active honey, and none of the honeys with
                    more than 10 samples were consistently active (Table 1). At the other end of the scale, few
                    of the multiply sampled floral sources produced uniformly inactive honey (Table 1). Plant-derived
                    factors that contribute to the antimicrobial activity in honey may be influenced
                    by local environmental conditions such as climate, water and nutrient
                    availability [12], and entomological factors may also contribute to
                    activity [39]. The complex interplay of plant species, plant
                    physiology, growth conditions, seasonal variations and bee physiology make it
                    difficult to predict whether or not a given honey sample is likely to have
                    antimicrobial activity. A remarkable finding of the current study was that even honeys produced in one
                    location at one time could vary in activity. In one example, 22
                        Banksia honey samples obtained following a single flowering
                    event were tested, with each honey sample collected from a separate hive in the
                    same apiary (samples B11–B32; Table S1). Total antibacterial activity among
                    21 of these samples ranged from 11.4 to 19.2% phenol equivalent, and one
                    sample had no detectable activity. Similarly, 18 Melaleuca
                    honey samples that had been collected from separate hives in a single apiary
                    included four inactive samples, with the remainder ranging in total activity
                    from 10.8 to 14.3% phenol equivalent (samples T11–T28; Table S1).
                    This suggests that entomological differences can have a substantial role in the
                    activity of honey, even more so than the floral source. The health of individual
                    bee colonies and the age of foraging workers may affect foraging activity or the
                    secretion of enzymes responsible for antibacterial activity, including glucose
                    oxidase [13],
                        [14],
                        [15],
                        [16]. In
                    addition, since truly monofloral honeys are often practically impossible to
                    obtain, different foraging preferences among colonies may result in honey
                    produced from the nectar of numerous floral species [40], thereby altering the overall
                    activity. Floral sources of honey are primarily identified as the dominant
                    species in flower at the time, and mixed floral sources may have been more
                    prevalent than was reported by beekeepers. This is of particular interest for
                        non-Leptospermum honeys exhibiting non-peroxide activity,
                    as there is the possibility that they contain some nectar from
                        Leptospermum species. This was considered unlikely in the
                    current study, however, since most were from regions where
                        Leptospermum is either not present or would not be in
                    flower when the bees were foraging. It is also possible that
                        Leptospermum honey with non-peroxide activity that was
                    collected in the Northern Rivers or Southeast Coast regions may contain nectar
                    from L. polygalifolium, even if beekeepers identified the
                    dominant floral source as a different Leptospermum species. A
                    more detailed investigation of the floral sources of these honeys, perhaps using
                    pollen analysis, is warranted. Non-peroxide activity was identified in 18 honey samples not derived from
                        Leptospermum flora (Table 2; Figure 1), including the majority of honeys
                    derived from spotted gum and Tasmanian wildflowers (3/4 and 3/5 of the honeys
                    sampled, respectively). On the whole, however, this activity was sporadic, with
                    no clear link to a particular floral source or geographic region. Tests on the
                    stability of honey following storage found the samples with non-peroxide
                    activity derived from clover, mixed flora and paperbark/brush box, as well as
                    samples from L. liversidgei, either remained relatively stable
                    or declined in activity over time, while the three honey samples derived from
                    only L. polygalifolium increased in activity (Table 4). Many beekeepers
                    find that non-peroxide activity increases over time [41], which may correspond
                    to an increase in Maillard reaction products including MG [23], [33], [42]. The fact that this
                    did not happen in non-peroxide honeys that were derived from plants other than
                        L. polygalifolium suggests that at least some of the
                    activity in these honeys is due to antimicrobial compounds other than MG. Bee
                    defensin-1 and other peptides, along with various phenolics, have been found in
                    different honey samples and have been proposed to convey antimicrobial effects
                        [19], [39], [43],
                        [44].
                    Whether any of these occur in the Australian non-peroxide honeys remains to be
                    determined. The stability of the antibacterial activity of honey over time has implications
                    for the shelf life of medicinal honey products. In the case of hydrogen
                    peroxide-dependent honeys this is likely to be due to the instability of glucose
                    oxidase, the enzyme responsible for hydrogen peroxide production, which is
                    influenced by various factors including pH and exposure to light [45]. Enzyme
                    stability is often affected by temperature, and the loss in activity was
                    mitigated to some extent by storage at 4°C (Table 4). Extra care in the handling and
                    storage of honeys with hydrogen peroxide-dependent activity may therefore be
                    necessary if these are to be used in the clinical setting. Regardless of the
                    reason behind any change in activity, honeys that are used in laboratory tests
                    over prolonged periods should be tested regularly to ensure that the level of
                    activity has remained constant. Degradation of activity over time does not
                    preclude the use of honey as an antimicrobial agent, since all medicinal
                    products have a shelf life and many require refrigeration. However, a greater
                    understanding of the time frame and the storage conditions that affect loss of
                    activity are vital in producing a standardised medicinal product. This study has provided a broad overview of the antibacterial activity of
                    Australian honey and shown that many honeys have potential for therapeutic use
                    as antibacterial agents. Jarrah and marri honeys have exceptional levels of
                    hydrogen peroxide-dependent activity, and non-peroxide activity in Australian
                        Leptospermum honeys is comparable to that found in New
                    Zealand manuka honey. These findings indicate that there is an opportunity for
                    Australian apiarists to share in the lucrative medicinal honey market. However,
                    the factors affecting antibacterial activity in honey are complex, numerous, and
                    not solely dependent on the floral source. This prevents generic statements
                    being made regarding the activity of honey derived from a given floral source,
                    and indicates the need to test individual batches of honey for their level of
                    antibacterial activity before they are designated as therapeutic products. Complete list of honey samples included in survey including floral source,
