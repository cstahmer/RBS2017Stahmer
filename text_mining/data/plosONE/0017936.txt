   In recent years, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
                    (MRSA) have become a truly global challenge. In addition to the long-known
                    healthcare-associated clones, novel strains have also emerged outside of the
                    hospital settings, in the community as well as in livestock. The emergence and
                    spread of virulent clones expressing Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is an
                    additional cause for concern. In order to provide an overview of pandemic,
                    epidemic and sporadic strains, more than 3,000 clinical and veterinary isolates
                    of MRSA mainly from Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Malta, Abu
                    Dhabi, Hong Kong, Australia, Trinidad & Tobago as well as some reference
                    strains from the United States have been genotyped by DNA microarray analysis.
                    This technique allowed the assignment of the MRSA isolates to 34 distinct
                    lineages which can be clearly defined based on non-mobile genes. The results
                    were in accordance with data from multilocus sequence typing. More than 100
                    different strains were distinguished based on affiliation to these lineages,
                        SCCmec type and the presence or absence of PVL. These
                    strains are described here mainly with regard to clinically relevant
                    antimicrobial resistance- and virulence-associated markers, but also in relation
                    to epidemiology and geographic distribution. The findings of the study show a
                    high level of biodiversity among MRSA, especially among strains harbouring
                        SCCmec IV and V elements. The data also indicate a high
                    rate of genetic recombination in MRSA involving SCC elements, bacteriophages or
                    other mobile genetic elements and large-scale chromosomal replacements. Citation: Monecke S, Coombs G, Shore AC, Coleman DC, Akpaka P, Borg M, et al.  (2011) A Field Guide to Pandemic, Epidemic and Sporadic Clones of

                20–30% of the human population [1]. Beyond asymptomatic
                carriage, S. aureus causes a wide range of infections, such as skin
                and soft tissue infections (SSTI), bone, joint and implant infections, pneumonia,
                septicaemia and various toxicoses such as toxic shock syndrome. It also occurs in
                many different species of animals, where it may cause comparable disease such as
                bovine mastitis. Shortly after the introduction of penicillin in the 1940s, the first
                penicillinase-producing S. aureus strains were detected, leading to
                the development of the penicillinase-resistant semi-synthetic penicillins such as
                methicillin, oxacillin and the first/second generation cephalosporins. Within a year
                after the introduction of these drugs, methicillin-resistant S.
                    aureus (MRSA) were reported in the United Kingdom (UK) [2]. Resistance is
                due to a modified penicillin binding protein (PBP2' or PBP2a) encoded by the
                    mecA gene. Apart from ceftobiprole [3], the presence of PBP2a confers
                resistance towards all β-lactam antibiotics. As methicillin and oxacillin can be
                used as indicators of resistance, PBP2a- or mecA-positive
                    S. aureus are referred to as either methicillin-resistant
                    S. aureus (MRSA) or oxacillin-resistant S.
                    aureus (ORSA). The mecA gene is located on complex
                mobile genetic elements, known as SCCmec (“staphylococcal
                cassette chromosome” or “staphylococcal chromosomal cassette”
                harbouring mecA). In addition to mecA,
                    SCCmec elements comprise recombinase genes, regulatory elements
                and, variably, additional genes encoding resistance to other antimicrobials, such as
                aminoglycosides or macrolides, and to heavy metal ions [4]; [ 5]. SCCmec
                types I, II and III (or 1B, 2A, 3A, [6]) are typically restricted to MRSA strains associated with
                healthcare infections and are not found widely among the healthy population. These
                strains, which initially were known as “Epidemic MRSA” (EMRSA), are now
                frequently referred to as “hospital-acquired” or
                “healthcare-associated” MRSA (HA-MRSA). The presence of their
                    SCCmec elements correlates with a relatively slower growth rate
                and it has been assumed that they may confer a selective disadvantage in the absence
                of antibiotics [7];
                    [ 8].
                Subsequently, strains carrying these elements may be less fit to survive in a
                competitive environment with faster growing wild type strains once antibiotic
                therapy is discontinued. The epidemiology of MRSA has changed since the 1990s with the emergence of new
                    SCCmec elements such as types IV and V (2B, 5C2). Strains
                carrying these elements evolved predominantly outside of healthcare settings or
                proved capable of spreading outside of hospitals, infecting not only patients but
                also colonising healthy contact persons. Many different strains of so-called
                “community-acquired” or “community-associated” MRSA
                (CA-MRSA) have spread worldwide. Some CA-MRSA strains harbour genes encoding the
                bi-component toxin Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL, [9]). Although this toxin was
                identified in S. aureus as early as 1932 [10], its presence in MRSA is a very
                recent phenomenon [11]. These strains are frequently associated with
                chronic/recurrent SSTI as well as with life-threatening necrotising pneumonia [12], often in
                previously healthy young people. PVL-positive CA-MRSA have become a serious public
                health concern because of their virulence, their ability to cause outbreaks in
                households and close contact social groups, and their rapid spread in many
                countries. Since 2003, some notable MRSA strains carrying SCCmec IV or V have
                spread among livestock revealing the truly zoonotic potential of S.
                    aureus/MRSA. These strains have been dubbed
                “livestock-associated“ MRSA (LA-MRSA, [13]). Additional novel SCCmec elements have been described [6]; [14]–[17] which indicate
                an ongoing evolution of antibiotic resistance in S. aureus. As
                β-lactam antibiotics are the first-line compounds for treatment of
                staphylococcal infections, this development may significantly limit therapeutic
                options. Alternative drugs that may be used to treat MRSA infections are generally
                expensive (e.g., quinupristin-dalfopristin, tigecycline, daptomycin
                and linezolid), or are problematic with regard to tissue penetration and efficiency
                    (e.g., vancomycin) or toxicity (e.g.,
                rifampicin). Of further concern is that resistance of MRSA to these compounds has
                already been observed, e.g., vanA-mediated vancomycin resistance
                    [18] and
                    cfr-mediated linezolid resistance [19]–[21]. The limited choice of therapeutic options available has made it necessary to attempt
                to limit the spread of MRSA by using a range of infection prevention and control
                measures such as hand hygiene, the use of protective clothing and equipment
                    (e.g., examination gloves or face masks), and accommodation of
                patients in isolation rooms or wards. The cost of these measures as well as the
                significant expense of second-line antimicrobials places a serious economic burden
                on scarce healthcare resources. Recent studies from Europe indicated that the
                average excess costs per MRSA-positive patient range from €5,700 to
                €10,000 [22]–[24]. Given the large number of MRSA carriers in Europe and in
                the USA, the financial burden to healthcare in these regions may account for
                billions of Euro or dollars (http://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/hotnews/55h168584264313.html). MRSA have become a real international problem. Some strains predominate in
                geographically restricted settings while others have achieved pandemic spread. Since
                a bewildering biodiversity of novel strains and SCCmec elements has
                been described in recent years, the objective of this study is to summarise the
                genotypic characteristics of pandemic, epidemic and sporadic MRSA strains from
                different parts of the world based on the authors' genotyping experiments and
                on the published literature. Information on target genes, probes and primers is provided in Supplemental file S1. The
                sequence types (ST, as defined by multilocus sequence typing, or MLST, [25]),
                    spa, SCCmec, capsule and agr
                types associated with each clonal complex (CC) as well as the names and accession
                numbers of associated whole genome sequenced strains are shown in Supplemental file S2. An
                overview of SCCmec types and their array hybridisation patterns is
                provided in Figure 1. The
                antimicrobial resistance and virulence-associated genes of each strain are shown in
                    Figures 2 and 3, respectively, while complete
                hybridisation profiles for the individual strains are provided in Supplemental file S3.  Black circles, positive; grey circles, present, but yielding weak or
                        ambiguous signals; divided circles, variable genes.

              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017936.g003 CC1 includes several strains of CA-MRSA including MW2/USA400, the first known
                    PVL-positive MRSA [11]. The CC1 strains ST573 and ST772 differ significantly
                    in MLST alleles to all other CC1 isolates and yield deviant hybridisation
                    patterns. Therefore they will be described separately (see below). The remaining
                    CC1-MRSA cluster into seven strains that can be differentiated based on the
                    presence of the PVL genes, SCCmec elements IV or V and the
                        SCCfus element. The latter comprises
                        ccrA-1 and ccrB-1 as well as the fusidic
                    acid resistance marker Q6GD50 (GenBank BX571857.1:SAS0043) first described in
                    the genome sequence of the CC1-MSSA strain Sanger MSSA 476 [26]. All isolates of these
                    CC1-MRSA strains harbour the enterotoxin gene seh and many
                    isolates also carry the enterotoxin genes sek and
                        seq. Other enterotoxin genes (sea-N315, seb,
                        sec and sel) are only found sporadically. Most
                    isolates harbour the immune evasion cluster (IEC) genes associated with
                    β-haemolysin-converting phages in various combinations. One CC1-MRSA strain carries SCCmec IV and PVL, but lacks
                        SCCfus. The genome sequence of MW2 [27] is a representative of this
                    strain, which is also known as USA400 or Canadian MRSA-7 [28]. The first known
                    PVL-positive CA-MRSA belonged to this strain. In the late 1990s, it caused fatal
                    infections in previously healthy children from Minnesota and North Dakota [11]. The authors
                    sporadically found isolates in Australia, Germany and the UK. A second strain also carries SCCmec IV, lacks
                        SCCfus, but differs from USA400 in being PVL-negative. It
                    has been found by the authors primarily in Australia where it is designated as
                    West Australian (WA) MRSA-57 although it also includes some of the isolates
                    originally described as WA MRSA-1. It has been isolated sporadically in Saxony
                    (Germany, [29]), Ireland [30] and Egypt (isolate
                    courtesy of M. Kamal El Din, Cairo). A third strain is PVL-negative, but harbours both, SCCmec IV and
                        SCCfus. It includes WA MRSA-45 and also some WA MRSA-1
                    isolates. It has been isolated in Australia as well as, sporadically, in Abu
                    Dhabi (United Arab Emirates [31]), the UK and Ireland [30]. Sporadic isolates of PVL-positive CC1-MRSA-IV with SCCfus,
                    PVL-positive CC1-MRSA-V and PVL-negative CC1-MRSA-V with SCCfus
                    have been isolated from a small number of cases in Australia. A PVL-positive
                    CC1-MRSA-V with SCCfus has been found in Abu Dhabi [31]. CC5 is another common and widespread clonal complex, which comprises a large
                    number of different MRSA strains, both HA- and CA-MRSA, some of which have
                    attained pandemic spread. Several whole genome sequences are available (Supplemental file S2)
                    which comprise the features of the CC5 core genome including characteristic
                    allelic variants of the ssl/set genes and of genes encoding
                    microbial surface components recognising adhesive matrix molecules of the host
                    (MSCRAMM genes). CC5 isolates carry the enterotoxin gene cluster
                        egc (seg, sei, sem, sen, seo and
                        seu/y), although partial deletions have been observed.
                    β-haemolysin-converting phages carrying sak, scn and
                        chp as well as sea or
                        sea-N315 in various combinations are commonly detected.
                    Many variable virulence- or resistance-associated genes and several different
                        SCCmec elements have been found in CC5. ST228-MRSA-I is colloquially known as the South German Epidemic Strain, Italian
                    Clone, [32];
                        [33] or
                    Spanish PFGE types E6/9/15/17/18 [34]. The strain occurs in
                    Germany (where it appears to be a strictly HA-MRSA strain, although its
                    incidence is decreasing), Hungary (where it replaced the “Hungarian
                    Clone” ST239-MRSA-III, [35]), Italy [32]; [33]; [36], Slovenia [36] and
                    Switzerland [37]. It was also found sporadically in Austria [38], Israel
                        [39], Malta
                        [40] and
                    Australia. MLST variants of this strain have been described from Croatia (ST111,
                        [41]) and
                    Paraguay (ST5, ST221, [42]). The isolates harbour SCCmec I. A
                    variant lacking ccrA/B-1 was identified in Saxony in 2000.
                    Variable markers [43] include the mercury resistance operon, the
                    β-lactamase operon as well as several other resistance genes (Figure 2), the toxic shock
                    syndrome toxin tst1, IEC genes and the MSCRAMM genes
                        bbp, clfA and sdrD. In
                    contrast to other CC5 strains, ST228-MRSA-I lacks fnbB, a gene
                    encoding a fibronectin-binding protein. Deletions of the leukocidin genes
                        lukD+lukE and of neighbouring genes from the
                        egc locus are common [43]. A ST5-MRSA-I, known as the Geraldine Clone, is a second SCCmec I
                    strain from CC5. This is a common CA-MRSA clone in France [44]. Apart from a single
                    veterinary isolate from Germany (courtesy of B. Walther, FU Berlin), isolates
                    have not been detected outside of France. Unlike ST228-MRSA-I, Geraldine Clone
                    isolates harbour Q6GD50, enterotoxin genes sed, sej and
                        ser and fnbB. Most isolates carry
                        tst1 and the enterotoxin genes sec and
                        sel. The SCCmec element lacks
                        pls-SCC. The Australian strains WA MRSA-18, -21 (both ST5) and -48 (ST835) represent a
                    third group of CC5-MRSA-I. These strains, however, harbour an atypical or
                    truncated SCCmec I element. The genes mecA, ΔmecR1,
                        ugpQ and ccrB-1 are detectable;
                        ccrA-1 occasionally yields a signal and
                        pls-SCC is usually absent. Resistance markers detected
                    among these CC5-MRSA-I isolates include the β-lactamase operon and, in some
                    isolates, qacC encoding resistance to quaternary ammonium
                    compounds. In addition to egc, the enterotoxin genes
                        sed, sej and ser are associated with these
                    isolates as well as, variably, sea or
                        sea-N315. ST5-MRSA-II is a pandemic CC5 strain. A MLST single locus variant (SLV) of this
                    strain, ST225-MRSA-II, has been reported [45]. Different STs as well
                    as a number of additional genetic polymorphisms within this strain might suggest
                    a polyphyletic origin by multiple and independent transfers of
                        SCCmec II elements to various CC5-MSSA precursor strains
                        [46].
                    Synonyms and vernacular names are UK-EMRSA-3, New York-Japan Clone, Rhine-Hesse
                    Epidemic Strain, Irish AR07.3, Irish AR07.4, Irish AR11, USA100 and Canadian
                    MRSA-2 [28]. Published CC5 genome sequences of isolates belonging
                    to this strain include Mu3, Mu50, N315, JH1 and JH9. Isolates of
                    ST5/ST225-MRSA-II have been identified in Austria [38], Croatia [41], Hong-Kong
                    (China, [47]),
                    Hungary [35], Japan [48], Portugal [49],
                    Taiwan [50],
                    the UK and the USA [48]. The authors have identified this strain in Ireland
                        [15] and in
                    different regions of Germany, the UK, Hong Kong and Australia. In
                    Dresden/Saxony, ST5-MRSA-II is the second most prevalent MRSA strain (accounting
                    for approximately 30% of isolates), and the most frequently isolated
                    strain in this region's intensive care units [51]. Transmission of this
                    strain has been reported in Australia where the index case was shown to be a
                    healthcare worker who previously underwent surgery in a New York hospital [52].
                    ST5-MRSA-II isolates usually exhibit spa types t002, t003 or,
                    in Ireland, t045. Antimicrobial resistance markers in ST5/ST225-MRSA-II isolates
                    may vary (see Figure 2),
                    although erm(A) and the aminoglycoside resistance gene
                        aadD are commonly present. Variable virulence-associated
                    genes include tst1, sea, sea-N315, sec, sed, sej, sel and
                        ser
                    [43].
                    Variants of this strain harbouring the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME)
                    have been isolated in Hong Kong and California/USA (NARSA 642). CC5-MRSA-III has been isolated from humans in the South African province of
                    KwaZulu-Natal [53], from Korean chicken meat samples [54], and from
                    turkeys or turkey meat in Germany (courtesy of S. Cortez de Jäckel,
                    Delbrück, Germany, and of the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment,
                    Berlin, Germany). The latter isolates harbour SCCmec IIIA,
                    lacking tet(K) and the mercury resistance operon. CC5-MRSA-III
                    may initially appear to be methicillin-susceptible but resistance is observed
                    following growth on selective agar containing methicillin [54]. CC5-MRSA-IV strains have achieved pandemic spread and significant clinical
                    relevance. Colloquially strains have been described as the Paediatric Clone
                    (although the first strain described under that name HDE288 has been
                    subsequently shown to be CC5-MRSA-VI, [55]), WA MRSA-03 (ST5), -25
                    (ST575), -39 (ST526), -50 (ST73) and -74 (ST5), USA800 or Marseille Cystic
                    Fibrosis Clone (ST5; [56]). As for ST5/ST225-MRSA-II, a large proportion of
                    CC5-MRSA-IV isolates carry sea-N315 and/or
                        sed+sej+ser. Other virulence genes, including
                        tst1 and the epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor gene
                        edinA, can be found in a minority of isolates. A novel
                    enterotoxin gene has recently been located on the same plasmid as
                        edinA (GenBank AP003089.1). Variable resistance markers in
                    CC5-MRSA-IV are shown in Figure
                        2. PVL-positive CC5-MRSA-IV has been identified by the authors in patients from the
                    UK, France, Australia, Switzerland and Senegal and previously in Ireland [57]. Based on
                    toxin gene profiles, these isolates cluster into three major variants harbouring
                        sea-N315+sed+sej+ser or
                        sea+edinA, or edinA.
                    Variable resistance markers are shown in Figure 2. ST5-MRSA-V has been described in Australia, where it is colloquially known as WA
                    MRSA-11, -14, -34 and -35, Ireland [30] and Abu Dhabi.
                    PVL-positive CC5-MRSA-V has been identified sporadically in Germany and Abu
                    Dhabi. CC5-MRSA-VI was first observed in Portugal in 1992 [58]. It was first described as
                    Paediatric Clone carrying SCCmec IV but was later reclassified
                    as harbouring a SCCmec VI element [55]. In France it was dubbed
                    the New Paediatric Clone [44]. This strain has been identified in Portugal,
                    Colombia, Argentina and the USA [58]. The authors identified New Paediatric Clone isolates
                        (spa type t105 or t777) in France, and very sporadically in
                    Australia and Germany, as well as PVL-positive CC5-MRSA-VI (spa
                    t311) in Switzerland. The latter strain has also been reported from the Azores
                    and Portugal [59]. A further novel SCCmec element (SCCmec type
                    VII, [6] or
                        SCCmec JCSC6082, GenBank: AB373032.1) was recently
                    described in Sweden [16]. This strain (courtesy of C. Berglund, Stockholm,
                    Sweden) yields signals with probes for mecA, ΔmecR1, ugpQ
                    and ccrC, and it is positive for blaZ and
                        tet(M). In addition to the above mentioned strains, several CC5-MRSA carry multiple or
                    composite SCCmec elements. One of these strains (ST149 which is
                    a MLST single locus variant, SLV, of ST5, spa-type t002) was
                    recently described in Malta [40]. This strain carries a SCCmec IV
                    element as well as Q6GD50 and novel ccrA and
                        ccrB genes (GenBank GU066221). The latter are identical to
                        ccrASHP+ccrBSHP in a Chinese isolate of S.
                        haemolyticus (GenBank EU934095.1, [60]), where these genes were
                    accompanied by the ACME locus [61]. This locus, however, is absent in the Maltese
                    strain. It lacks PVL, but it carries sea, egc
                    as well as, commonly, tst1, sec and sel. Some
                    isolates harbour the resistance genes erm(C) and
                        tet(K). This strain appears to be common in Malta [40], but has
                    not been reported elsewhere. Another, PVL- and tst1-positive
                    ST149-MRSA-IV has been isolated from a Libyan patient in Switzerland [62]. A composite variant of a SCCmec IV has been described in the CC5
                    strain MRSA-ZH47 [63]. It resembles a SCCmec IV element,
                    but also carries a set of SCCmec V-like recombinase genes
                        (ccrC and “ccrAA”, a putative
                    recombinase gene, see Materials and
                    Methods). Another CC5 strain with multiple/composite SCCmec elements
                    originates from Spain. Isolates from a German patient hospitalised in the Canary
                    Islands [29]
                    and from a patient in Barcelona (Courtesy of S. Molinos, Barcelona) yielded
                    hybridisation signals for mecA, ΔmecR1, ugpQ, ccrA-2, ccrB-2,
                        ccrA-4 and ccrB-4. Because of the carriage of
                        erm(C), msr(A), mph(C),
                        aphA3 and sat as well as affiliation to
                        spa type t067, these isolates probably represent an
                    epidemic strain, or a close relative of it, recently described in Spain [64].
                    Similar isolates harbouring only erm(C) have been found by the
                    authors in France, Australia and Germany. A CC5 strain with a composite SCCmec element comprising
                        SCCmec IV, ccrA-1, ccrB-1 and Q6GD50 has
                    recently been described in the Netherlands [65]. Australian ST835 strains WA MRSA-40/46 harbour SCCmec
                        VT elements and ccrA/B-2 genes. These strains
                    vary in the presence of β-lactamase genes, the mupirocin and trimethoprim
                    resistance genes mupA and dfrA, qacA as well
                    as of sed+sej+ser. The authors have identified other
                    CC5-MRSA which harbour composite or multiple SCCmec elements
                    including [mecA, ΔmecR1, ugpQ, ccrA-1, ccrB-1,
                    pls-SCC, dcs, ccrC], [mecA,
                        ΔmecR1, ugpQ, dcs, ccrA-2, ccrB-2, ccrC] and
                        [mecA, ugpQ, “ccrAA”,
                        ccrC, ccrA-4, ccrB-4]. However, these MRSA strains
                    were only represented by one or two isolates in each case. According to MLST data, ST6 is a double locus variant (DLV) of ST5
                        (arcC-12 and yqiL-3 rather than
                        arcC-1 and yqiL-10, as in ST5). However,
                    ST6 isolates differ in agr group, capsule and
                        spa types. They harbour different alleles of
                        hsdS-, set/ssl- and several MSCRAMM genes
                        (bbp, fnbB, sdrC, sdrD, clfA, clfB, sasG). In addition,
                    isolates of this ST carry cna but lack egc.
                    These observations may be explained by a large scale chromosomal replacement
                    with one parental strain belonging to CC5. The origin of the inserted region has
                    not yet been determined. The size and location of the insert can be estimated by
                    analysing the known positions of the probe sequences within the published CC5
                    genome sequences. Thus, the insert is localised around oriC,
                    and ranges from hsdS3 downstream of oriC to
                    the ssl/set-locus upstream of oriC. This
                    equals ca. 1.500.000 bp (i.e., about half of
                    the genome). It can be assumed that the SCCmec element is
                    integrated into that insert. ST6 strains tested for the present study were PVL
                    negative. They included ST6-MRSA-IV from Australia (where it is known as WA
                    MRSA-51) and Abu Dhabi [31] as well as ST6-MRSA-V from Hong Kong. CC7-MRSA are rare. One ST, ST1048, is discussed separately due to its divergent
                    hybridisation pattern. The authors identified single isolates of CC7-MRSA-IV and CC7-MRSA-V in Saxony
                    and in Australia, respectively. The enterotoxin A allele
                        sea-N315, also known as sep, is present in
                    both isolates (and it is also common in CC7-MSSA). Both isolates are
                    PVL-negative. Similar to CC5, CC8 is a pandemic MRSA lineage. Numerous MRSA strains have
                    originated from CC8, including both CA- and HA-MRSA, and several whole genome
                    sequenced MRSA strains represent this lineage (see Supplemental file S2).
                    Although related to CC8, ST72 and ST239/241 are discussed separately as they
                    exhibit distinct hybridisation patterns. The core genome genes of the remaining
                    CC8 strains such as protease, ssl/set and MSCRAMM genes of
                    clinical isolates are in accordance with the sequenced genomes although
                    occasional deletions of genes such as bbp, clfA or
                        sdrD can be observed. Carriage of exotoxins and of
                    β-haemolysin-converting phages is highly variable. Several different CC8
                    strains have been described, and can be distinguished based on
                        SCCmec types and exotoxin profiles. The first known MRSA was a CC8 strain, ST250-MRSA-I, which is also known as Early
                    or Ancestral MRSA, Irish AR02 or Irish Phenotype I and II. The genome sequence
                    (GenBank CP000046) of the strain COL, which was isolated in England in the
                    1960s, is representative of this strain [66]. The ST250-MRSA-I clone seems
                    to be disappearing. However, it is still isolated in Australia, although rarely
                    (one isolate out of more than 4000 tested, [67]). The description in this
                    study is based on COL and on isolates recovered from hospitalised patients in
                    Ireland in the 1970s to 1980s [15]. All isolates closely resemble COL, and they also
                    show a characteristic deletion of several ssl/set genes. The
                    carriage of pls-SCC [15], several resistance markers
                    (see Figure 2), enterotoxin
                    genes seb+sek+seq and of β-haemolysin-converting
                    phages (sak, chp and scn) is variable. A very similar and, likewise, ancient strain is ST247-MRSA-I. A reference
                    isolate, NARSA 209, was recovered in the UK in 1971. Vernacular names include
                    North German Epidemic Strain, UK-EMRSA-5, -8 and -17, Rome Clone, Spanish PFGE
                    type E1, [34],
                    Irish AR22, Irish New02 and, after an outbreak in Barcelona in 1989, Iberian
                    Clone [68].
                    ST247-MRSA-I seems to be receding, as observed, for example, in Portugal [49] and
                    Spain [69]. It
                    has not been identified in Dresden, Saxony, since 1997 ([70] and authors'
                    observations) or in Ireland since 1999 [15]. Thus, the description in
                    this study is based partially on isolates recovered from the 1990s. More
                    recently, ST247-MRSA-I has been found in Australia, Croatia [41], the Czech
                    Republic [71],
                    Italy, where it is also becoming increasingly rare [33], and in the Netherlands
                    (isolates courtesy of P. Beisser, Maastricht). Although this strain yields a
                    hybridisation profile similar to that of ST250-MRSA-I, it harbours a complete
                    set of ssl/set genes, and with regard to these genes it
                    resembles the NCTC8325 or USA300 genome sequences more than COL. Enterotoxin
                    genes seb+sek+seq are rare, but about half of the
                    isolates harbour sea. As in other CC8 isolates,
                        bbp is deleted in a number of isolates. In addition to
                        SCCmec I, all tested isolates carry
                    tet(M). Additional resistance markers have been detected in
                    some isolates (Figure
                    2). Several different CC8-MRSA-IV strains have been described previously based on
                    different typing methods. In the following paragraphs, we define these strains
                    with reference to their carriage of exotoxin genes. However, as these genes are
                    located on mobile elements such as phages or plasmids, it may be that these
                    “strains” are in fact polyphyletic clusters. One of these strains
                    includes CC8-MRSA-IV isolates which lack PVL or any enterotoxin genes (besides
                    the ubiquitous enterotoxin homologue, GenBank CP000046.1:SACOL1657). They belong
                    to ST8 or ST576 (tpi-19 instead of tpi-4) and
                    include UK-EMRSA-14 and WA MRSA-5, -6 and -31. NARSA 645 is a reference strain
                    that shows an Iberian Clone-like PFGE pattern (http://www.narsa.net). The
                    authors found only a single isolate from Germany. However, in Australia this
                    strain appears to be rather common. Isolates differ in the carriage of
                    β-haemolysin-converting phages and of a variety of resistance genes. Another PVL-negative CC8-MRSA-IV has been named the Lyon Clone or UK-EMRSA-2. It
                    is frequently isolated in France [44], and can occasionally be
                    identified in Germany, Ireland [30], the UK, the Netherlands
                    (isolates courtesy of P. Beisser, Maastricht), Norway (courtesy of H. V. Aamont,
                    Aakershus) and Australia. Most isolates of this strain carry sea,
                        sak and scn, as well as, commonly,
                        sed+sej+ser. Some isolates lack the
                        sea gene. These isolates harbour chp, sak
                    and scn, or they have a non-disrupted hlb gene
                    and lack all IEC genes. Variable resistance markers are the mercury resistance
                    and β-lactamase operons, erm(A), erm(C),
                        vga(A)-BM3327, aacA-aphD, aadD, dfrA, far1,
                        tet(K), tet(M), qacA and
                        qacC. Another related strain has been described as
                    UK-EMRSA-6. It is also sea-positive, and differs from Lyon
                    Clone/UK-EMRSA-2 in the presence of aphA3+sat. Another strain of CC8-MRSA-IV carries the enterotoxin genes
                        seb+sek+seq, but lacks PVL. It is known as USA500
                    with NARSA 385 being a reference strain. Isolates have been identified in the
                    USA (NARSA 119, -120, -121, -678, -686 and -708) and Australia (as a SLV, ST612,
                    WA MRSA-20, [72]) as well as, for the present study, in the UK, in
                    Ireland and, sporadically, in Germany. Some of the German isolates were
                    recovered from patients with travel histories (Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and
                    Mozambique) suggesting a wide distribution of this strain in Sub-Saharan Africa.
                    This is also indicated by frequent observations of ST612 in South Africa [73].
                    USA500 has also been found in horses from the USA, Canada [74], Ireland [30] and
                    Germany [75]
                    as well as from humans with contact to horses [30]. Equine isolates differ
                    from human isolates of USA500 by the absence of lysogenic β-haemolysin
                    converting phages and thus they also lack the sea, sak, chp and
                        scn genes. The carriage of resistance markers is highly
                    variable (Figure 2). A notable PVL-positive ST8-MRSA-IV is the widely known strain USA300 (also known
                    as WA MRSA-12, Canadian MRSA-10 [28] or Spanish PFGE type
                    A, [34]).
                    Within a few years it has spread extensively across the USA, effectively
                    marginalising other S. aureus strains, MRSA as well as MSSA
                        [76]. It is
                    mainly community-associated, but hospital-associated cases also occur [77]; [78]. In Europe,
                    USA300 has not been isolated frequently. For instance, eight out of 25
                    PVL-positive CA-MRSA from Ireland were identified as USA300 [57]. Since
                    these isolates originated from a sample of 1,389 MRSA isolates, it can be
                    concluded that USA300 in particular, and PVL-positive MRSA in general, are much
                    less of a problem in Ireland than in the USA [57]. In Dresden/Saxony, the
                    authors identified the first case of a USA300 infection in 2005 [29], but only
                    sporadic isolates have subsequently been observed (including three among 304
                    genotyped MRSA isolates from patients of the University Hospital Dresden, 2007
                    to 2009, unpublished observation by the authors). In the UK, USA300 is much less
                    common than in the USA [79]. USA300 has also been infrequently found in
                    Switzerland [80] and Spain [81]. In Abu Dhabi, three out
                    of 54 isolates were identified as USA300 [31]. In Australia, although the
                    overall prevalence is low, case numbers are steadily increasing [82]. Some
                    infections with this strain have also been noted in Japan [61] and Hong Kong (in the present
                    study). Two whole genome sequences of USA300 have been published
                    (USA300-FPR3757, GenBank CP000255, [61] and USA300-TCH1516, GenBank
                    CP000730, [83]). Both sequences harbour SCCmec IV
                    and adjacent ACME genes. It has been hypothesised that this locus is related to
                    enhanced survival of the organism on intact skin and, thus, to increased
                    transmissibility by skin contact. However, a considerable proportion of
                    Australian USA300 isolates lack the ACME locus [82]. The absence of ACME has
                    been described in isolates from Colombia, too [84]. Other genes or gene
                    clusters are also subject to a high degree of genetic variability in USA300 and
                    genotyping of 76 West Australian isolates identified 16 different variants of
                    USA300 [82].
                    However, the most common variant in Germany, Abu Dhabi and Australia is
                    indistinguishable from the sequenced strain USA300-TCH1516. Variability within
                    USA300 can involve β-haemolysin converting phages (sak, chp,
                        scn) and enterotoxin genes (sek, seq). The authors
                    also observed isolates that yielded USA300-like hybridisation patterns
                    (including ACME), but lacked the SCCmec element [82] or even
                    the PVL genes (isolate courtesy of P. Beisser, Maastricht), respectively.
                    Resistance genes in USA300 are highly variable (see Figure 2 and [82]). The recent detection of
                    plasmid-encoded cfr in an Irish USA300 isolate [21] is a reason
                    for concern as this gene confers resistance to five classes of antimicrobial
                    drugs including the oxazolidinones (linezolid). Other CC8-MRSA-IV strains have been found sporadically in Australia. One carries
                    PVL and enterotoxin genes sed+sej+ser and
                        sek+seq, but lacks ACME (WA MRSA-62). Another harbours
                        tst1+sec+sel and, variably,
                        edinA. CC8-MRSA-V has been found occasionally in Saxony and Australia. The Australian
                    CC8-MRSA-V isolates (WA MRSA-53) carry sea and
                        seb+sek+seq. These genes, however, are absent in
                    the Saxon isolate. CC8-MRSA-VIII harbouring a class A mec complex and
                        ccrA/B-4 genes has been recently described in Canada [17] where this
                    strain is known as Canadian MRSA-9. It was reported to carry enterotoxin genes
                        sea and seb. The authors obtained two
                    isolates (one from Ireland [85], and one from Australia, WA MRSA-16) which were
                    similar with regard to SCCmec associated genes. However, they
                    lacked the enterotoxin genes. Several CC8-MRSA carry irregular, multiple or composite SCCmec
                    elements. One is ST8-MRSA-II also known as Irish AR05, AR13, AR14, Irish-01 or
                    Irish New03. This strain was predominant in Ireland [86] in the 1990s. However, it
                    now appears to be marginalised by other strains. Thus, the following description
                    is based partially on isolates from the 1990s. It is spa type
                    t190. This strain harbours SCCmec II, from which the
                        kdp operon is absent [15]. Based on this observation
                    as well as on additional variation affecting the mec complex
                    and the presence of pUB110, carrying aadD, and
                        Tn554, carrying erm(A),
                        SCCmec II subtypes A to E have been described [15]. Thus, the
                    microarray allows rapid SCCmec II subtyping with
                        [aadD+ and mecI/xylR+]
                    being SCCmec IIA or IIB (depending on presence and localisation
                    of Tn554), [aadD+ and
                        mecI/xylR-] being SCCmec IIC,
                        [aadD- and mecI/xylR+]
                    being SCCmec IID and finally, [aadD- and
                        mecI/xylR-] being SCCmec IIE.
                    Additionally, this strain harbours ccrA/B-4 genes, which are
                    more homologous to those of the SCC-CI element from S.
                        epidermidis than to other ccrA/B-4 sequences from
                    MRSA [87]. The
                    microarray revealed that the mercury resistance operon is usually present, and a
                    possible link to additional ccrA/B-4 genes, as seen in a SCC-CI
                    element from S. epidermidis (ATCC12228), is currently under
                    investigation. Essentially all ST8-MRSA-II, AR13/14 isolates harbour
                        erm(A) and aacA-aphD. Other resistance
                    markers including blaZ+blaI+blaR and
                        mupA are variable. The majority of isolates carry a
                    lysogenic β-haemolysin converting phage (scn, sak, and
                        sea). They do not harbour enterotoxin genes apart from
                        sea. Protease genes splA, splB and
                        splE as well as sdrC are usually
                    absent. Another strain with an irregular or composite SCCmec element is
                        ST8-MRSA-IV+ccrA/B-4, also known as Irish AR43,
                    Irish-02, UK-EMRSA-12 and -13. This strain predominated in Northern Ireland in
                    1999 [86]
                    (when most of the isolates described herein were sampled), but it has also been
                    found in Norway (isolates courtesy of H. V. Aamont, Aakershus) as well as by the
                    authors in the UK and Australia. The spa type is usually t190
                        [87]. This
                    strain harbours SCCmec IV, although some isolates have been
                    found to lack ccrA/B-2, possibly due to in
                        vitro passage or exposure to freezing and thawing during storage.
                    Variation in the region downstream of the mec complex or,
                    respectively, in the J1 and J3 regions, allowed distinguishing subtypes IVE and
                    IVF [15].
                    Isolates of Irish AR43 harbour an additional set of ccrA/B-4
                    genes similar to Irish AR13/14. Irregular SCCmec elements can also be observed in ST254-MRSA
                    which is known as UK-EMRSA-10 or the Hannover Epidemic strain
                        (spa t009 or t036). Although in the 1990s ST254-MRSA was
                    frequently isolated in German hospitals, it has receded since 2000. However,
                    this strain is the predominant MRSA isolated from horses in Germany [75]. There are
                    two variants of this strain which differ in relation to the carriage of
                        SCCmec associated genes (see Figure 1). The Hannover Epidemic Strain is a
                    multi-resistant strain, and the antimicrobial resistance genes
                        tet(M) and aacA-aphD are always present.
                    In addition, aphA3, sat as well as the mercury resistance
                    operon can be detected in most isolates. The MSCRAMM gene bbp
                    is usually absent. Enterotoxin genes seb+sek+seq are
                    always detectable. Genes associated with lysogenic β-haemolysin-converting
                    phages (sea, sak and scn) are usually present
                    in isolates from humans, but have not been detected in equine isolates. Most CC9-MRSA strains have been recovered from veterinary sources. Particular
                    strains from humans, ST733/834, have been assigned to CC9 by MLST, but will be
                    discussed separately because of their distinct hybridisation pattern. CC9-MRSA
                    with SCCmec types III and V have mainly been recovered from
                    pigs or farm workers in mainland China, Hong Kong and Malaysia as well as in
                    Italy [88]-[92]. The authors recently identified isolates of
                    CC9-MRSA-IV in turkeys (courtesy of S. Cortez de Jäckel, Delbrück) and
                    in retail chicken meat from Germany. Isolates are PVL-negative and do not carry
                    other enterotoxin genes besides egc. Resistance markers are the
                    β-lactamase operon, qacC, erm(B) and
                        aadD. An isolate of CC12-MRSA-IV genotyped for this study was found in Ireland [15]. This strain
                    was also observed in a small number of cases in Norway [93]. Another CC12-MRSA strain,
                    WA MRSA-59 from Australia, has an irregular or truncated SCCmec
                    element (mecA, ugpQ, mecI, mecR1, but no xylR
                    and no detectable recombinase genes). Isolates carried the enterotoxin homologue
                    ORF CM14, sea-N315 and seb. PVL has not been
                    detected in this lineage. While CC15-MSSA are abundant among healthy carriers [94], MRSA from this lineage
                    are extremely rare. To our knowledge, CC15-MRSA has only been detected in a
                    collection of Italian MRSA strains isolated in 1980. This included three
                        SCCmec I isolates and an isolate described to carry an
                        SCCmec I variant in which ccrA/B-1 was
                    replaced by ccrA/B-2
                    [33].
                    Within the present study, the authors did not identify a single CC15-MRSA
                    isolate among approximately 3,000 genotyped MRSA. Thus, the description of the
                    general features of this CC relies on data from MSSA (Supplemental file S3,
                        [94];
                        [95]).
                    Exotoxin genes (lukF/S-PV, sea, etA) are
                    detectable only in a very small minority of isolates. The chp
                    and scn genes are present, but sak was absent
                    from essentially all isolates. A single isolate of a CC20-MRSA-V was identified in 2009 in Australia. It is
                    negative for PVL genes. It also lacks other toxin genes, although seb,
                        sec, sel and lukM+lukF-P83
                    genes have been identified by the authors in CC20-MSSA of human and veterinary
                    origin. CC22 is a common and widespread clonal group and different MRSA strains have
                    emerged from this genetic background. The sequencing of a complete genome of a
                    CC22 strain could provide valuable insight in S. aureus
                    biodiversity since alleles from CC22 appear to differ from previously published
                    sequences. For instance, a CC22-specific allele of ssl7/set1
                    has already been identified (GenBank AF188836). Many probes on the DNA array
                    yield irregular or weak signals with CC22 isolates, which could be attributed to
                    the presence of divergent sequences. Beside ssl/set- and
                    MSCRAMM genes, this also affects the γ-haemolysin locus. Probes for
                        lukS/F-hlg and hlgA (derived from CC1, 5
                    and 8 sequences) yield weak or no signals, while a probe based on a
                        lukS-hlg sequence from CC45 is strongly reactive (GenBank
                    EF672356) [96]). Leukocidin lukD+lukE and
                    proteases splA, splB and splE have not been
                    detected in CC22 isolates and it is not yet known whether they may be present as
                    variant alleles or are absent in this lineage. CC22-MRSA with SCCmec types I, II or III have, to our knowledge,
                    not been reported. ST22-MRSA-IV is a pandemic CC22-MRSA strain. This strain is known as UK-EMRSA-15,
                    Irish AR06, Barnim Epidemic Strain or Spanish PFGE type E13, [34], or
                    Canadian MRSA-8 [28]. It has been reported in many countries [33]; [57]; [97]-[104]. Where
                    ST22-MRSA-IV occurs, it tends to be abundant. In Dresden, ST22-MRSA-IV accounted
                    for nearly 50% (141 out of 304 genotyped isolates from 2007 to 2009); in
                    Portugal for 54% [49], in Malta for 66% [40], and in Ireland [85]; [105] as well
                    as on the Azores [59] for more than 80% of MRSA isolates. In
                    England, ST22-MRSA-IV is increasingly common (apparently at the expense of
                    ST36-MRSA-II, UK-MRSA-16, [106]), being currently responsible for 85% of MRSA
                    bacteraemia cases. ST22-MRSA-IV occurs in hospitals as well as in outpatients,
                    and it has been recovered from animals such as horses [75], cats [107] and dogs
                        [102];
                        [107].
                    Common resistance markers are β-lactamase and erm(C). A
                    high percentage of Maltese ST22-MRSA-IV isolates harbour Q6GD50 which has not
                    been found in isolates from other geographic regions [40]. Variable virulence
                    markers in ST22-MRSA-IV are sec and sel as
                    well as the IEC genes encoded by lysogenic β-haemolysin-converting phages
                        (sak, chp, scn). The presence of tst1, or
                    sometimes of tst1 and sea, is found in some
                    isolates from Abu Dhabi [31], Egypt (isolates courtesy of M. Kamal El Din, Cairo)
                    and England (where patients' names suggest a Middle Eastern origin). A case
                    of an infection with a tst1-positive CC22-MRSA-IV has recently
                    been reported from the USA, where it was one of the first reports of this strain
                        [108]. Another, distinct ST22-MRSA-IV strain is found in Dublin, Ireland [109]. Its most
                    distinguishing feature is the presence of the ACME-locus. It carries
                    β-lactamase and erm(C) as well as, in the majority of
                    cases, lnu(A), aacA-aphD, aadD and
                        mupA. A large scale nosocomial outbreak of PVL-positive ST22-MRSA-IV has been described
                    in Bavaria, Germany [110]. Other isolates have also been found in Australia,
                    England [111], Ireland [57] Abu Dhabi [31] and Hong
                    Kong. Additionally, PVL-positive ST22-MRSA-IV has been isolated from patients in
                    Germany who had family ties to Turkey [112]. Their presence in
                    epidemiologically unrelated settings suggested a polyphyletic origin, given that
                    PVL-positive CC22-MSSA are common and widespread [113]. Indeed, the
                    demonstration of at least three different PVL-encoding phages, φPVL,
                    φ108PVL and an unidentified icosahedral phage, in CC22-MRSA from England
                    and Wales [40] indicates that this “strain” has evolved
                    on multiple occasions. Furthermore, ST22-MRSA-IV harbouring PVL and
                        tst1 genes have been recently described in India [114]. Variable
                    resistance markers in PVL-positive ST22-MRSA-IV include β-lactamase,
                        erm(C), aacA-aphD, aadD, dfrA and
                    Q6GD50. Sporadic cases of a PVL-negative CC22-MRSA-V have been identified by the authors
                    in Saxony, as well as a PVL-positive CC22-MRSA-V in Western Australia. CC30 is another important clonal complex from which HA- and CA-MRSA originate. It
                    is represented by the genome sequence of Sanger MRSA 252. Core genomic markers,
                        ssl/set- and MSCRAMM genes are present as allelic variants
                    which differ distinctly from other CCs. Some of these variants resemble alleles
                    found in other CCs such as CC22 and CC45 [96] which may be more closely
                    related to CC30 than to other CCs such as CC1, CC5 or CC8 [115]. Shared features of CC30
                    strains include the presence of egc (although partial deletions
                    may occur) and cna. MSCRAMM genes bbp, fnbB
                    and sdrD are usually detectable, but may be deleted from
                    individual isolates. Lysogenic β-haemolysin-converting phages are usually
                    commonly present. Because of the variable presence of sea and
                        chp, it can be assumed that different phages have
                    integrated into CC30 genomes. CC30-MRSA-I was reported in Italy in 1980 [33]. A more widespread HA-MRSA strain from this lineage is ST36/39-MRSA-II, also known
                    as UK-EMRSA-16 [116], USA200, Irish AR7.0/AR07.2, Spanish PFGE type E12,
                        [34], or
                    Canadian MRSA-4 [28]. Although frequently isolated in the UK and Ireland
                    in the 1990s [15], recently it has become increasingly rare [107]. Isolates
                    have also been found in Malta [40]; [117] and South Africa [73]. In Germany,
                    ST36-MRSA-II is very rare. This strain harbours SCCmec II
                    including aadD and erm(A) in integrated
                        pUB110 and Tn554, respectively, as well as
                    the β-lactamase operon and occasional other resistance markers (Figure 2). Most clinical
                    isolates carry tst1, although this gene is absent in the genome
                    sequence of Sanger MRSA252. This strain also lacks sdrD. The
                    enterotoxin gene sea is also common, although another reference
                    strain, ATCC43300, is sea-negative. ATCC43300 is unique among
                    the tested ST36/39-MRSA-II in being positive for sec+sel
                    and fnbB. Another important CC30-MRSA strain is the PVL-positive ST30-MRSA-IV, Southwest
                    Pacific Clone, USA1100 or West Samoan Phage Pattern (WSPP) Clone. This CA-MRSA
                    strain was first observed among Samoan immigrants in New Zealand, but is
                    widespread with isolates investigated in the present study coming from Germany,
                    Switzerland, the UK, Australia [29]; [80], Hong Kong, Taiwan [50], Abu Dhabi, and the USA
                    (NARSA 484). Other reports of this strain include Ireland [57], where it is the
                    predominant PVL-positive MRSA strain, Scandinavia, Latvia [118] and Kuwait [119]. The WSPP
                    Clone apparently evolved from the pandemic phage type 80/81 strain. This MSSA
                    emerged in the 1950s and caused outbreaks of severe infections worldwide;
                    however it virtually disappeared after the introduction of
                    penicillinase-resistant β-lactams [120]. A PVL-negative, but tst1-positive strain of ST30-MRSA-IV is
                    sporadically isolated in Ireland [15] and Australia. An infection with a PVL-positive
                    CC30-MRSA-V has been described in Egypt [121]. A similar isolate has been
                    identified from a patient with a SSTI living in the German/Polish border region
                    (courtesy of R. Hillert, Görlitz). CC45 is another major lineage from which several MRSA strains have emerged. They
                    cluster into two distinct groups as the majority of isolates belong to
                        agr group I, while some strains yield a unique pattern.
                    They fail to react with all three agrD-I probes, but they are
                    positive with agrB and agrC probes
                    corresponding to agr groups I and IV (for the sake of
                    simplicity they are here referred to as CC45/agr IV). PVL has
                    not been detected in the present study among CC45-MRSA isolates. However, two
                    cases of PVL-positive ST45-MRSA-IV from Belgium [45] and Germany [122] have been
                    reported. Leukocidin genes lukD+lukE were not identified.
                    In contrast to CC22, the γ-haemolysin genes hlgA and
                        lukF-hlg can be detected in CC45 isolates, and
                        lukS-hlg was shown to be present in a specific allelic
                    variant (GenBank EF672356, [96]). As observed in CC22, probes for protease genes do
                    not yield signals. Enterotoxins sec and sel
                    are occasionally found. Irregular signals for ssl/set might
                    indicate the presence of yet unknown alleles. The gene cna is
                    present, but sasG can only be detected in the
                        CC45/agr IV isolates. ST45-MRSA-II, (known as USA600, USA600-MRSA-II or Canadian MRSA-1 [28])
                    appears to be largely restricted to North America, where glycopeptide-resistant
                    variants and an unusually high mortality rate of bloodstream infections
                    associated with this strain have been reported [123]. Outside the USA,
                    ST45-MRSA-II is rarely isolated, but this strain has, like ST45-MRSA-I and -III,
                    been sporadically detected in Hong Kong [47]. In addition, the authors have
                    identified a single isolate of ST45-MRSA-II in Australia. This isolate as well
                    as reference strains NARSA 22, NARSA 648 and NARSA 715 were genotyped. They
                    carry SCCmec II, including aadD and
                        erm(A), as well as the β-lactamase operon. Variable
                    resistance markers (positive in NARSA 22) include aacA-aphD,
                        dfrA and qacC. Another important CC45 strain is ST45-MRSA-IV, which is known as the Berlin
                    Epidemic Strain, WA MRSA-75 or USA600-MRSA-IV. In Saxony, it is a relatively
                    common MRSA strain (ca. 9% of MRSA isolates from
                    Dresden, 2007-2009), and in Belgium it is the predominant MRSA strain [45]. This
                    strain also occurs in the UK, the Netherlands [45], Switzerland [124], Croatia
                        [41] and
                    Australia. Unlike the Australian isolates, most of the Saxon isolates harbour
                        aphA3 and sat. As in other CC45 strains,
                        egc is present but seg is not detectable
                    in many isolates. Enterotoxin genes sec and
                        sel as well as genes sak, chp and
                        scn, indicative of lysogenic β-haemolysin-converting
                    phages, are commonly detected. A similar CC45-MRSA-IV strain isolated in Australia carries sec, sel,
                        tst1 and ACME. ST45-MRSA-V has been found sporadically in Germany and in Australia (WA MRSA-4)
                    as well as in Portugal [49]. Most isolates tested for this study harbour
                        tst1, sek and seq. A distinct group of CC45 isolates display agr IV alleles.
                    Furthermore, these strains differ from other CC45 strains in that they carry
                    other alleles of MSCRAMM genes fnbA, fnbB, sdrD, vwb and of
                        lmrP. They are positive for sasG. Isolates
                    carry sej and usually yield weak signals for
                        ser probes, which may indicate the presence of an allelic
                    variant of this gene. The gene sed, which is normally located
                    on the same plasmids as sej and ser
                        (e.g., pIB485, GenBank M94872.1) cannot be detected. The
                        spa types associated with CC45/agr IV
                    isolates are t727, t1081 (although this type can also be observed in ST1048 and
                    ST1774, see below and [125]) or t1575. CC45/agr IV MRSA are
                    widespread and increasingly common in Australia. There are two different strains
                    carrying SCCmec type IV (WA MRSA-23) or V elements (WA
                    MRSA-84), respectively. CC45/agr IV-MRSA-IV and -V are commonly
                    isolated in Hong Kong (author's observations, [47]; [125]) and few isolates of a
                        CC45/agr IV-MRSA with a combined SCCmec
                    IV/V element have been identified as part of this study in Hong Kong. One of
                    these isolates is ACME-positive. Sporadic isolates of CC45/agr
                    IV-MRSA-IV have also been observed in Ireland [15]. Several strains of CC59-MRSA can be distinguished based on carriage of
                        SCCmec elements and PVL as well as on MLST and
                        spa typing. West Australian strains of CC59 have recently
                    been described in detail [126]. One PVL-positive strain, ST59-MRSA-IV, also known as USA1000, is mainly
                    restricted to the USA (reference strains NARSA 483, NARSA 676). The authors
                    identified a single isolate of USA1000 from Australia. The spa
                    types associated with this strain are t216 or t316. USA1000 carries the
                    β-lactamase operon and, variably, erm(A). Beside PVL, it
                    harbours chp, scn and, variably, the enterotoxin genes
                        seb, sek and seq. A sporadic Australian
                    strain (WA MRSA-73, spa t528) is PVL-negative, but otherwise
                    indistinguishable from USA1000 in terms of overall hybridisation patterns. WA MRSA-24 is an infrequently isolated, mainly Australian CC59 strain with a
                        SCCmec IV element. This strain belongs to ST87 (a SLV of
                    ST59) and spa type t216. The β-lactamase operon,
                        msr(A), mph(C),
                        aphA3+sat, seb, sek and
                        seq are present. This strain is also positive for
                        sak, chp and scn but
                    lacks sea. PVL is absent. A group of sporadic Australian, Hong Kong and UK [127] isolates, dubbed WA
                    MRSA-55/56, are ST59-MRSA-IV/spa type t437. These isolates
                    carry PVL (although one PVL-negative isolate was also identified), seb,
                        sek and seq. The gene sea is only
                    detected occasionally. The most widespread CC59-MRSA strain is PVL-positive ST59/952-MRSA-VT
                    which is known as the Taiwan Clone. Isolates of this strain belong to
                        spa types t437, t1950 or t2365. ST59/952-MRSA-VT
                    is a common and clinically important MRSA strain in Taiwan [14]; [128]-[131]. The authors found this
                    strain in Hong Kong, Australia, where it is the most frequently isolated
                    CC59-MRSA strain, Saxony (a single case of recurrent furunculosis, [29]) and the
                    UK [127].
                    This strain has a characteristic variant of a SCCmec V element,
                    in which two ccrC genes are present (SCCmec
                        VT or 5C2&5, GenBank AB12129, [132]). Enterotoxin genes
                        seb+sek+seq are usually
                    detectable. All isolates carry erm(B),
                        aphA3+sat and
                        blaZ+blaI+blaR. In addition,
                    tet(K) and cat can often be found. This strain
                    is indistinguishable from WA MRSA-55/56 in all markers covered by the microarray
                    with the sole exception of the SCCmec element. Therefore, it
                    may be assumed that both strains emerged from the same ancestral MSSA acquiring
                    different SCCmec elements. Additionally, there are also ST59-MRSA isolates harbouring a
                        SCCmec V rather than a SCCmec
                        VT element. PVL-negative ST59-MRSA-V (WA MRSA-9) has occasionally
                    been observed in Australia [126] as well as PVL-positive CC59/ST359-MRSA-V in the UK
                        [80]. WA MRSA-15 is another ST59 strain with a composite or novel
                        SCCmec element. This is the second most common CC59-MRSA
                    strain in Australia [126]. Its spa type is t976. Microarray
                    hybridisation and PCR results suggest either the presence of a composite IV and
                    V SCCmec element, or the presence of ccrC in
                    addition to SCCmec IV. This strain is PVL-negative, but it
                    harbours sea and usually
                        seb+sek+seq. The β-lactamase
                    operon is present while msr(A)+mph(C),
                        aphA3+sat and tet(K) can be detected
                    sporadically. According to the MLST database, ST72 belongs to CC8. However, isolates yield a
                    distinctive hybridisation profile. Differences to CC8 include the presence of
                        egc and of CC5-like alleles of several MSCRAMM genes
                        (bbp, sdrC, sdrD). MLST suggests a recombination of CC5 and
                    CC8. Specifically, yqiL, pta and
                        tpi may be derived from CC8 (yqiL-3,
                        pta-4, tpi-4), while gmk,
                        aroE and arcC suggest CC5 parentage
                        (gmk-8, aroE-4, arcC-1).
                    The glpF allele (glpF-1) may have originated
                    from either clonal complex. Mapping the positions of probe binding sites over
                    the known CC5 and CC8 genomes shows that CC5- and CC8-derived genes alternate
                    through the genome suggesting multiple recombination events. Alleles of some
                        ssl/set genes and vwB, sasG and
                        clfB which are not associated with CC5 or CC8 suggest the
                    involvement of additional, yet unidentified donor strains. Two MRSA strains have been identified. One is a PVL-negative ST72-MRSA-IV which
                    is known as USA700. It does not harbour exotoxins beside egc,
                    and its carriage of resistance genes is variable (Figure 2). This strain includes NARSA 386 and
                    689. Isolates have been identified in Saxony and in Abu Dhabi. PVL-positive
                    ST72-MRSA-IV has been isolated by the authors in Australia (WA MRSA-44) and from
                    SSTIs of German tourists returning from Costa Rica. CC75 (ST75, ST1304) as well as ST883 and ST1303 are discussed as a group because
                    they share several distinctive features. ST75-MRSA-IV (WA MRSA-8 and -79)
                    isolates have been recovered from people residing in remote communities of
                    Northern and Western Australia, and appear to be largely restricted to this part
                    of the world. Although it is PVL-negative, this strain is a common cause of
                    community acquired SSTIs [133]. There has been a single report of ST75-MRSA-V [133]. One
                    isolate of ST1304-MRSA-IV (WA MRSA-72) from Australia was characterised. This is
                    a SLV of ST75-MRSA-IV that also differs in carriage of possibly plasmid-borne
                    enterotoxin genes (see below). ST883-MRSA-IV (WA MRSA-47) and ST1303-MRSA-IV
                    occur sporadically in the Northern part of Western Australia. Recently it has been shown that MLST genes of these strains differ grossly from
                    that of any other known S. aureus (see [134] and Figure 4). Although not phenotypically
                    different to other S. aureus, it has been suggested that ST75
                    strains should be regarded as a new subspecies of S. aureus
                    [134]. These
                    strains do not yield hybridisation signals with specific probes for capsule
                    types 1, 5 or 8 and for agr groups I to IV. Unique
                        agrB, agrD and agrC sequences have been
                    demonstrated in ST75 (GenBank FJ154839, [135]; [136]) and ST883 (GenBank
                    HQ260328, [136]). Genes encoding leukocidins and exfoliative toxins
                    as well as protease genes splA, splB and splE
                    cannot be detected by microarray hybridisation. Probes for MSCRAMM-,
                        ssl/set- and hsdS-genes generally yield
                    patterns which differ from all other S. aureus strains. With
                    regard to these genes, ST883 and ST1303 resemble each other but differ from
                    CC75. The gene cna is absent and sasG can be
                    detected in CC75 only. The β-haemolysin gene hlb can only
                    be detected when using random primer directed amplification, suggesting the
                    presence of an allelic variant. CC75 and ST1303 carry egc
                    (although sen is either absent, or present in an unknown
                    allele). Seven out of eighteen ST75-MRSA-IV isolates as well as the single
                    ST1303-MRSA-IV isolate tested carry seb. ST1304-MRSA-IV is
                    positive for sed+sej+ser.  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017936.g004 The vast majority of CC80 isolates belong to a PVL-positive strain harbouring
                        SCCmec IV. Although SCCmec type I has
                    previously been described in CC80 [41], the authors did not
                    identify this strain in this study. Likewise, PVL-negative variants of
                    CC80-MRSA-IV are infrequently isolated and have only been found in France and
                    Croatia [41]. PVL-positive CC80-MRSA-IV has been dubbed the European CA-MRSA Clone. The strain
                    is widespread and has been isolated in Austria [137], Denmark (where this
                    strain was detected as early as 1993 [138]), France [44], Germany
                        [80];
                        [139],
                    Greece (isolates courtesy of V. Gogou, Larissa, [48]; [140]), Ireland
                        [57],
                    Malta [40],
                    the Netherlands [141], Norway [93], Portugal [142], Sweden
                        [143],
                    Switzerland [80] and the UK [80]; [144]; [145]. In Greece, a considerable
                    percentage of MRSA infections can be attributed to this strain [140]. The
                    authors have identified isolates in Abu Dhabi, and other studies also indicate a
                    wide distribution in the Middle East including Kuwait [119], Lebanon [146], Israel
                        [39], Egypt
                        [147]
                    Algeria [148] and Tunisia [149]. Travellers returning
                    from the Dead Sea or from Saudi Arabia to Germany [112], or from Tunisia or Libya
                    to Switzerland [62] as well as patients with family ties to Turkey [112] have been
                    found to carry this strain. In Australia, ST80-MRSA-IV as well as two SLVs,
                    ST583 (WA MRSA-17) and ST728 (WA MRSA-30) are rarely isolated. CC80-MRSA-IV
                    carries PVL, etD and edinC, but lack
                    enterotoxin genes (beside an ubiquitous homologue, GenBank
                    CP000046.1:SACOL1657). Nearly all CC80-MRSA-IV isolates carry
                        aphA3 and sat; and they harbour the
                    plasmid encoded genes blaZ, tet(K) and far1.
                    Additional resistance genes lnu(A) or erm(C)
                    are rarely detected. Mupirocin resistance in this strain has been reported
                    previously [150]. Several different CA-MRSA belong to this CC which appears, based on
                        spa sequences and hybridisation profile, closely related to
                    CC1 and CC80. It includes ST78-MRSA-IV (as well as its SLVs ST129, ST255,
                    ST257), which is known in Australia as WA MRSA-2. This strain is PVL-negative,
                    but usually harbours enterotoxin genes sec and
                        sel. In addition, the vast majority of isolates carry
                        blaZ and erm(A). It is frequently isolated
                    in Australia, and a single isolate has been identified, as part of this study,
                    in a patient from Saxony. CC88-MRSA-IV carrying the exfoliative toxin gene etA were
                    identified by the authors in the Netherlands, Portugal, Angola and Senegal.
                    There is also a report from Japan [151]. PVL-positive CC88-MRSA-IV
                    has been identified by the authors in the UK [80], Abu Dhabi and Australia.
                    Other reports of this strain have come from Spain [152] and Nigeria [153]. PVL-positive CC88-MRSA-V and PVL-negative CC88-MRSA-VI have been identified
                    sporadically by the authors in Western Australia. PVL-positive CC88-MRSA-V were
                    recently described from Italy [33]; [ 154]. ST93 is a unique ST of S. aureus, which is essentially
                    restricted to Australia. While PVL-negative ST93-MRSA-IV and PVL-positive
                        ST93-MRSA-VT are extremely rare, a PVL-positive ST93-MRSA-IV is
                    common and currently spreading across Australia [155]. This CA-MRSA strain is
                    also known as the Queensland Clone [156]. A few cases have been
                    identified in the UK suggesting small scale importation due to travel activities
                        [157].
                    Recently, a whole genome sequence, JKD6159 (GenBank CP002114), has been
                    released. In terms of hybridisation profiles and especially with regard to
                        ssl/set genes, ST93 differs markedly from other S.
                        aureus lineages [80]. Enterotoxin genes and tst1 are
                    absent but the enterotoxin homologue ORF CM14 is present. CC97-MSSA can often be isolated from cattle [158] and occasionally from
                    humans [95],
                    but MRSA from this lineage are rare. CC97-MRSA-IV has sporadically been isolated
                    from human patients in Australia (WA MRSA-54), Abu Dhabi [31] and, as part of this study,
                    in Saxony. A ST97-MRSA-V has been isolated in Egypt (isolate courtesy of M.
                    Kamal El Din, Cairo). A further CC97-MRSA strain has recently been described
                    from the UK [159]; [160], in which a SCCmec V element, ACME
                    and ccrA/B-4 genes are detectable. A CC97-MRSA strain was
                    identified by the authors in swine from Germany. The strain carries a novel or
                    composite/hybrid SCCmec element yielding signals with probes
                    for mecA, ugpQ, ccrA-1, ccrB-1,
                    “ccrAA” and ccrC. All CC97-MRSA
                    isolates tested are PVL-negative. Although CC121-MSSA are a common cause of SSTI worldwide [113]; [142]; [153]; [161]; [162], MRSA
                    from this lineage appear to be very rare. The authors found a single MRSA
                    isolate, CC121/ST577-MRSA-V (WA MRSA-22), in Australia. While PVL is common in
                    CC121-MSSA [113], this isolate is PVL-negative. It harbours
                        etA and edinA. Further CC121-MRSA-IV have
                    been described from sporadic cases in the UK [145], Portugal [163], Poland
                        (http://www.isssi2008.com/abstract/13.asp), China (see MLST
                    database, quoted in [163]) and the USA [164]. A PVL-positive CC121-MRSA-V
                    strain was identified recently in two unrelated paediatric patients from
                    Cambodia [165]. CC152-MRSA-V has been found sporadically in Germany [80], Sweden [166],
                    Switzerland [62] and Australia (WA MRSA-89). Some patients infected
                    with this strain had ties to Balkan countries (Macedonia, Kosovo [62]; [80]) which
                    might indicate a wider distribution in that region. All isolates of this strain
                    carry PVL genes and edinB. Probes for
                        lukD+lukE as well as
                        hlgA+lukS-hlg+lukF-hlg yield signals only after
                    random amplification, which suggests the presence of hitherto unknown alleles.
                    Enterotoxin genes and most ssl/set genes are not
                    detectable. ST377-MRSA-V has been observed in France, the Netherlands, Switzerland and
                    Australia [167]. It is closely related to ST152 and cannot be
                    distinguished using standard MLST primers. Specific gmk primers
                    able to distinguish ST152 from ST377 have been described by Garnier [167]. A
                    ST152-MRSA with a non-typeable SCCmec element has been isolated
                    in Denmark from a patient with a travel history to Kosovo [138]. Two ST154-MRSA isolates have been characterised in this study, both cultured from
                    central Asian immigrants to Western Europe [57]; [166]. The origin of these two
                    isolates as well as a report from Mongolia [168] suggests a wide distribution
                    of this strain in Central Asia. One isolate harbours a typical
                        SCCmec IV element, while the other (courtesy of C.
                    Berglund, Stockholm) lacks ccrA-2 and ccrB-2.
                    Both isolates are PVL-positive. According to MLST data, CC188 is related to CC1 although it differs in two
                    alleles (arcC-3 and gmk-8 instead of
                        arcC-1 and gmk-1 [169]). However, CC188
                    hybridisation profiles are clearly distinct. Differences include the alleles of
                    the agr locus, clfA, clfB, ebh, ebpS, fnbA, fnbB, hsdS,
                        sdrC, sdrD and vwb, the presence of
                        cna as well as the absence of sasG, seh,
                        splA and Q2FXC0. Since these genes are distributed
                    widely across the genome, the differences to CC1 strains cannot readily be
                    explained by chromosomal replacement as previously observed for ST34 and ST239
                        [170].
                    Therefore, either the positions of the genes in the genome may be different than
                    in the sequenced genomes, or CC188 originates from multiple recombination
                    events. ST188-MRSA-IV has been found sporadically in Australia (WA MRSA-38 or -78, [72]). Apart from
                        SCCmec IV, β-lactamase and aacA-aphD,
                    this strain may carry erm(B), tet(K) and
                        cat. PVL, enterotoxin genes and tst1 are
                    not present. Other ST188-MRSA have been observed from Asian countries:
                        ST188-MRSA-III/spa t189 in Korea [171], PVL-negative CC188-MRSA-V
                    in Hong Kong, and PVL-positive ST188-MRSA-V in Malaysia [172]. ST239 isolates belong to CC8. However, ST239 (including ST240 and ST241, which
                    differ only in mutations in pta or yqiL genes,
                    respectively) is discussed separately from CC8. The reason is the integration of
                    a CC30 DNA fragment of approximately 635,000 base pairs (or ca.
                    20% of the genome, [170]; [173]) into a CC8 parent strain, with the integration site
                    being localised around oriC. This has led to divergent MLST
                    profiles (arcC-2, rather than arcC-3, [170]; [173]),
                        spa types and hybridisation profiles. Differences to other
                    CC8 strains include the affiliation to capsule type 5, the alleles of
                        aur, clfB and isaB and the presence of
                        cna, while other markers (such as agr
                    group I alleles, ssl/set genes etc.) are in
                    accordance to CC8. Two genome sequences of ST239-MRSA-III have recently been
                    released (strain TW20, [173] and JKD6008, [174]). ST239-MRSA-III is probably the oldest pandemic MRSA strain. It has been reported
                    in many European countries including Croatia [41] the Czech Republic [71]; [175], Greece
                    (isolates courtesy of V. Gogou, Larissa), Italy [33], Malta [40], Portugal
                        [49]; [176], Spain [69] and the UK. In Hungary, it
                    was common but it has been largely replaced by ST228-MRSA-I [35]. In
                    Ireland, ST239-MRSA-III became the predominant strain in the 1980s [15], after it
                    was introduced into the country following the repatriation from Iraq of a trauma
                    patient [177]. In Saxony, this strain is rarely isolated and has
                    been identified by the authors in patients with travel histories to Greece [29] or Turkey.
                    This strain is frequently isolated in Turkey [178], Iran [179], Saudi Arabia [180], Hong Kong
                        [47], mainland
                    China [181]; [182], Taiwan [14]; [181] and Singapore [183]. In Trinidad
                    & Tobago [184] it is virtually the only existent MRSA. In
                    Australia, it is a common cause of hospital-acquired infection in the East coast
                    states, and large outbreaks in the 1980s were attributable to this strain [155].
                    Furthermore, ST239-MRSA-III has also been reported in Argentina [185],
                    Brazil [186]; [187], Chile [185], Egypt (isolates
                    courtesy of M. Kamal El Din, Cairo), India [104], Korea [171], Malaysia
                        [172], Mongolia [168], New Zealand [174], Pakistan [188], Paraguay
                        [42],
                    Russia [189], South Africa [73], Thailand [176] and Uruguay
                        [185]. The reference strain ATCC33592, recovered in a
                    hospital in New York [190], belongs also to ST239-MRSA-III. The evolution of this strain has recently been reviewed based on genome sequences
                    of 63 isolates from different parts of the world analysing genome-wide
                    single-nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions or deletions [191]. In short, ST239-MRSA-III
                    can be divided into three clades; a European, presumably ancestral one, an Asian
                    and a South-American. However, there is some evidence for secondary,
                    travel-associated cross-transmission [191]. ST239-MRSA-III is colloquially known as the Czech, Vienna, Hungarian, Portuguese
                    or Brazilian Clone, UK-EMRSA-1, -4, -7, -9 or -11, AUS-EMRSA-2 or -3, Irish
                    Phenotype III, Irish AR01, -09, -15 or -23, Canadian MRSA-3 (this refers to the
                    ST241 SLV, [28]) or as Canadian MRSA-6 [28]. However, all these
                    designations should be regarded as synonyms as their distinction is not always
                    clear-cut. For instance, the Hungarian Clone was described as harbouring
                        SCCmec III, while the Brazilian Clone carries
                        SCCmec IIIA [192]. The difference is
                    only the presence (III) or absence (IIIA) of an integrated plasmid
                        pT181, which encompasses, among other genes,
                        tet(K). Since the SCCmec-associated
                    mercury resistance operon and other resistance and enterotoxin genes vary
                    independently of pT181/tet(K) among these
                    clones and since tet(K) might also be part of free plasmids,
                        tet(K) could be regarded just as one mobile element among
                    many others. Beyond the issue of tet(K), there are also other
                    variations of the SCCmec III element. About two thirds of
                    tested isolates harbour the mercury resistance operon. It is often, but not
                    always, accompanied by
                        “ccrAA”+ccrC. This
                    indicates a linkage of SCCmec III to SCCmer
                    [4]. Some
                    isolates do not yield signals with a probe which normally reacts in both,
                        mecR1 and ΔmecR1; this could probably
                    be attributed to another partial deletion of the mecR1 gene. In
                    one case, the authors found the absence of mecI, mecR1 and
                        xylR. Variable resistance genes in ST239-MRSA-III include
                        erm(A), erm(C), aacA-aphD, aadD,
                        aphA3, sat, dfrA, mupA, tet(K), different alleles of
                        cat, qacA and qacC. PVL
                    has not been detected in ST239-MRSA-III. Enterotoxin genes sea,
                        sek and seq as well as phage-associated genes
                        sak, scn and chp are variable. The ACME
                    locus is present in a minority of isolates ([172], and in three out of
                    some 200 tested by the authors). The authors observed three different CC361-MRSA strains. All are PVL-negative.
                    CC361-MRSA-IV is detected sporadically in Western Australia (ST672-MRSA-IV or WA
                    MRSA-29, [72])
                    and one isolate originated from Ireland. CC361-MRSA-V was isolated in Abu Dhabi
                    where it appears to be rare [31]. A CC361-MRSA-VIII was found in Australia where it is
                    referred to as WA MRSA-28 [72]. Isolates harbour the enterotoxin gene locus
                        egc, which, however, might be partially deleted. One out of
                    three tested WA MRSA-29 isolates carries tst1 and
                        seb, which is a highly unusual combination of virulence
                    genes [193]. CC398-MRSA has recently received a lot of attention as strains from this lineage
                    are of animal origin but are able to cause disease in humans. This has led to
                    intense investigations including the sequencing of a complete genome of a
                    ST398-MRSA-V strain, S0385, from the Netherlands [194]. ST398-MRSA-III, spa type t567, has been observed in Belgium
                        [13].
                    ST398-MRSA-IV isolates appear to be a rare livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA)
                    strain. Two infections of humans were observed in Hong-Kong [47] and isolates
                    from poultry have been reported from Belgium [13]. In Germany, this strain
                    has been detected in cattle [195] and in turkeys (courtesy of S. Cortez de
                    Jäckel, Delbrück), and by the authors in turkey meat samples. Isolates
                    are negative for exotoxin genes and for sak, scn and
                        chp. PVL-negative ST398-MRSA-V is frequently found in association with livestock,
                    although this strain is also increasingly isolated from human patients without
                    animal contact. It was first discovered in a family outbreak in the Netherlands
                    in 2006. Family members were farmers, and the strain was subsequently found in
                    pigs from the same farm. Further investigations showed its presence in a high
                    proportion of Dutch pigs as well as in farm personnel, veterinarians and
                    students [196]-[200]. Recently, this strain has been observed not only in
                    pigs, but in humans, cattle [158]; [195], horses [75], dogs [201], poultry
                        [13],
                    chickens and turkeys (courtesy of S. Cortez de Jäckel, Delbrück and of
                    the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, Berlin). It was also found in retail
                    meat of different domestic animals [202]; [203]. In addition to the
                    Netherlands, ST398-MRSA-V has been identified in Germany, Belgium, Italy,
                    Austria, Spain [13]; [90]; [202]; [204]-[208] Canada (http://promedmail.oracle.com/pls/otn/f?p=2400:1001:8447806422203976::NO::F2400_P1001_BACK_PAGE,F2400_P1001_PUB_MAIL_ID:1010,81749),
                    the USA [209]
                    and Australia (author's unpublished observation). This strain shows a
                    remarkable diversity with regard to resistance genes. Isolates carry
                        SCCmec V, or rather SCCmec VT,
                    as indicated by the genome sequence of strain S0385 [194]. Rarely, recombinase
                    genes “ccrAA” and ccrC may be
                    absent. Essentially all isolates harbour the β-lactamase operon and
                        tet(M). Additionally, tet(K) is frequently
                    detected. The multidrug resistance gene cfr has recently been
                    observed in ST398-MRSA-V [19]. In addition to the resistance markers detected by
                    array hybridisation (Figure
                        2), tet(L), dfrK and
                        dfrG can be found by PCR in some isolates [210]–[212]. Recently, the novel
                    trimethoprim resistance gene dfrK
                    [210], the
                    macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance gene erm(T)
                        [212], a
                    ABC transporter gene vga(C) for streptgramin
                    A-lincosamide-pleuromutilin resistance ([213]) and the novel apramycin
                    resistance gene apmA
                    [214] have
                    been described on plasmids from this strain. Many isolates of ST398-MRSA-V
                    harbour multiple resistance genes which provide the same resistance phenotypes
                        (tet(K)+tet(M),
                        tet(L)+tet(M) or
                        tet(K)+tet(L)+tet(M);
                        erm(A)+erm(C) or
                        erm(A)+erm(B)). The vast majority of
                    ST398-MRSA-V isolates are negative for enterotoxin genes. Among 54 swine
                    isolates from Germany, seb was detected only once, and
                        sek+seq were detected in three isolates [215]. The genes
                        sak, scn and chp were absent from isolates
                    of the European LA-MRSA strain. However, these genes where detected by the
                    authors in two human isolates from Hong Kong; one of which harbours
                        sea. PVL-positive ST398-MRSA-V has been described in China [216], and in children of Asian
                    origin living in Sweden [217]. Two isolates (courtesy of C. Welinder-Olsson,
                    Gothenburg, Sweden) have been genotyped. In contrast to the livestock-associated
                    ST398-MRSA-V isolates, they carry sak, scn and
                        chp. One isolate harbours also sea. ST426-MRSA-IV has recently been described from the Arkhangelsk region in Russia
                        [162].
                    The authors did not isolate ST426-MRSA within the present study, but genotyping
                    data of ST426-MSSA isolates [94]; [95]; [113] allow the general features of that sequence type to
                    be described. ST426-MSSA isolates harbour tst1, sea and ORF
                    CM14 as well as, variably sec+sel, see and/or
                        sek+seq. The gene cna can be detected
                    in most isolates. Notably, nuc (encoding thermostable nuclease,
                    DNAse) is not detectable by hybridisation. Since ST426 isolates are
                    phenotypically DNAse-positive, the presence of a variant nuc
                    allele can be assumed. CC509 appears to be a very rare CC [94]; [218], but MRSA belonging to
                    it have previously been observed in Queensland, Australia [218]. One isolate of
                    CC509/ST207-MRSA-V from New South Wales, Australia was genotyped. It is
                    PVL-negative. The egc locus appears to be present in a variant
                    or truncated form with only genes sem and seo
                    being detectable. Sequence types 573 and 772 belong, according to the MLST database, to CC1.
                    However, with respect to the pta allele these strains differ
                    from other CC1 (pta-12 or pta-22,
                    respectively). Their hybridisation profile is also distinct, which may be
                    attributed to one or multiple recombination events that have introduced genes
                    from other CCs into CC1. This includes agr (group II rather
                    than III), genes encoding the capsule type (5 rather than 8), the
                        egc enterotoxin gene cluster, and the enterotoxin homologue
                    ORF CM14. The enterotoxin H gene seh, which is otherwise
                    typical for CC1 strains, cannot be detected in ST573/772. The genes
                        cna and sasG are present. Protease genes
                        splA, splB and splE are absent. A PVL-negative ST573-MRSA-V strain has been described from Australia (WA MRSA-10,
                        [72]). PVL-positive ST772-MRSA-V, which is known as WA MRSA-60 or the Bengal Bay Clone
                        [111],
                    is relatively multi-resistant compared to other CA-MRSA. In addition to a
                        SCCmec V (specifically, a VT[127])
                    element, they carry variably blaZ, erm(C),
                        msr(A), mph(C), aacA-aphD, aphA3,
                        sat and tet(K). Besides the PVL genes, all
                    isolates tested harbour sea, and most carry
                        sec and sel. This strain was found by the
                    authors in Australia, Germany, the UK, Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi. German and
                    British patients usually had a travel history or family background suggesting an
                    infection in India or Bangladesh ([111], H.J. Linde,
                    Regensburg, Germany, pers. communication, and own observations) where it appears
                    to be increasingly common [104]. ST799-MRSA has been found sporadically by the authors in the UK, Ireland, France
                    and Australia. Isolates harbour a C2 mec gene complex
                        (mecA, ugpQ) but carriage of ccr genes
                    varies (“ccrAA”+ccrC or
                        “ccrAA”+ccrA/B4, or no
                    detectable recombinases). Q6GD50 is detectable, possibly indicating a
                    combination of SCCmec and SCCfus elements.
                    ST779-MRSA are PVL-negative, but carry etD and
                        edinB. According to the MLST database, ST834 belongs to CC9. However, microarray
                    hybridisation profiles differ from other CC9 strains in several key features
                    such as agr allele (agr group I rather than
                    II), capsule type (8 rather than 5), spa type, presence of
                        sasG and alleles of some MSCRAMM genes (bbp, map,
                        vwb). ST834-MRSA-IV occurs rarely in Australia, where it has been
                    described as WA MRSA-13. The tested isolates harbour tst1, sec
                    and sel, but lack PVL genes. PVL-negative ST834-MRSA-IV also
                    has been observed in Cambodia [165]. A single isolate of a ST913-MRSA-IV was identified by the authors from a Lebanese
                    refugee in Germany who suffered from haemorrhagic bronchitis. It is positive for
                    two genes encoding exfoliative toxins (etA and
                        etD) as well as for edinB. It lacks
                    enterotoxins and PVL. A recent paper [39] on MRSA isolates from the
                    Negev region of Israel suggests a wider distribution of this strain in the
                    Middle East as well as the presence of closely related ST912 and ST914. This sequence type has only been reported in Hong Kong where it was sporadically
                    isolated in nursing homes [125]. The authors found a single isolate from Hong Kong.
                    ST1048 is related to CC7, but differs in some markers including the presence of
                        sasG and cna, and the alleles of
                        arcC and spa. It has spa
                    type t1081, which can also be observed in CC45 and ST1774. The tested isolate
                    carries SCCmec IV, ccrC, and ACME. It is
                    negative for PVL and enterotoxin genes, but a previous study [125] indicated the
                    presence of egc genes seg and
                        sei in some isolates of this ST. This strain was isolated from several patients in Hong Kong and has not been
                    described previously. It shares spa type t1081 with other
                    clones (CC45 and ST1048, see [125]). Isolates carry SCCmec IV,
                        ccrC, and ACME. PVL and enterotoxin genes cannot be
                    detected. Variable resistance markers include the β-lactamase operon and
                        qacC. Genes of the “core genome” and the “core variable genome”
                        [219]
                    yield essentially the same phylogenetic information as the seven housekeeping
                    genes used for MLST. Consequently, a MLST clonal complex can be identified by
                    microarray hybridisation based on a characteristic fingerprint pattern [96], provided
                    that a hybridisation pattern for this CC has been defined previously. For CC
                    assignment, the presence or absence of sasG, cna, fosB,
                        lukD+lukE, egc, seh,
                    ORF CM14 as well as the identification of the actual allelic variant of genes of
                    the agr, ssl/set, hysA, hsdS,
                    and capsule loci and of genes encoding MSCRAMMs, proteases and a leukocidin
                    homologue (“lukY”) are used [96]. Whilst clonal complex
                    affiliation can be easily determined, the assignment to “strains” is
                    not that straightforward. The concept of the “strain” can be
                    beneficial for infection control purposes and subsequently, a wide variety of
                    different epidemic or pandemic MRSA strains have been described. Unfortunately,
                    different criteria and different methods have been applied for defining and
                    naming MRSA strains. This has resulted in a confusing situation with several
                    strains having multiple designations. For instance, ST5-MRSA-II is known as the
                    Rhine-Hesse Epidemic Strain in Germany, UK-EMRSA-3 in the UK, USA100 in the USA,
                    CMRSA-2 in Canada, AR07.3, AR07.4 or AR11 in Ireland, and New York-Japan Clone
                    in Australia and elsewhere. For this reason, Enright et al.
                        [220]
                    proposed to designate strains by “sequence
                        type-MRSA-SCCmec type” such as
                    “ST5-MRSA-II”. We largely followed this principle. However, this
                    nomenclature has shortcomings if clearly different strains have the same ST and
                        SCCmec type (such as the various ST8-MRSA-IV). Additional
                    information, such as PVL status or carriage of superantigens, is of relevance in
                    defining the “pathotype” of the organism, which is important for
                    clinical management purposes. Thus, PVL-positive and PVL-negative strains of the
                    same ST and SCCmec affiliation are treated separately here, as
                    their clinical significance may be different. Another challenge, beyond the definition of individual strains, is that the
                    concept of a “strain” in itself cannot properly be defined.
                    Traditionally a strain has been defined as “an isolate or group of
                    isolates that can be distinguished from other isolates of the same genus and
                    species by phenotypic characteristics or genotypic characteristics or
                    both” [221]; [222], which is essentially
                    the same as a clone which is defined as a group of “isolates that are
                    indistinguishable from each other by a variety of genetic tests” [221]; [222]. Thus,
                    the definition of a clone or strain depends on the discriminatory power of the
                    test and/or on the number of different tests applied. Isolates which appear to
                    be indistinguishable by, e.g., PFGE might yield differences
                    detectable by microarray hybridisation or genome sequencing. In the case of
                        S. aureus, all previously defined strains can be subdivided
                    into a considerable number of variants as they harbour variable genes in
                    different combinations [29]; [43]; [82]. Of course, it is not practical to regard all these
                    variants as “strains” and to invent and to use different names for,
                        e.g. the variants of ST22-MRSA-IV which just differ in
                    carriage of erm(C) or sec+sel. However,
                    UK-EMRSA-2 and UK-EMRSA-6 (both CC8-MRSA-IV) are regarded as different
                    “strains” although they differ only in the presence of
                        aphA3 and sat, neither of which are
                    particularly important from a clinical perspective. Similarly, Vienna and
                    Hungarian epidemic strains differ basically in the presence of
                        tet(K). On the other hand, isolates which are known as the
                    Hannover Epidemic Strain could easily be divided into two “strains”
                    based on their different SCCmec elements. In fact, a
                    “strain” may be of polyphyletic origin. MSSA from different branches
                    of one clonal group may have acquired the same SCCmec element
                    independently on several occasions. This has previously been proposed in the
                    case of ST5-MRSA-II [46]. These few examples emphasise the fact that the
                    concept of “strains”, although convenient and practical, is in fact
                    a rather arbitrary approach of forcing taxonomy on permanently changing and
                    evolving biological subjects. When scrutinised by methods such as genome
                    sequencing or microarray hybridisation, “strains” are not static
                    blocks comprised of identical isolates, but rather consist of groups of isolates
                    with similar sequences. These sequences might differ in single point mutations
                    (as sometimes obvious in MLST, e.g., Taiwan Clone isolates may
                    have different gmk alleles), in the composition and sequence of
                    single loci (such as the variable part of the spa gene or the
                        dru region within the SCCmec element) or
                    in the presence or absence of complete genes or multi-gene mobile elements.
                    Thus, the concept of “quasispecies” [223]-[227] could be applied in
                    which the genome “cannot be described as a defined structure, but rather
                    as a weighted average of a large number of individual sequences” [228]. The
                    difference between S. aureus and the RNA-viruses (to which this
                    concept has been applied first [228]), is basically the time frame in which variations
                    evolve. Conveniently, the extent and time frame of variability in S.
                        aureus provide ample opportunities for typing,
                        i.e., for outbreak investigations and infection control
                    purposes. For more than three decades, MRSA was mainly an issue of hospital hygiene and
                    infection prevention and control. Interestingly, the “older”
                        SCCmec elements found in HA-MRSA strains have largely been
                    observed in and restricted to a few genotypes, mainly to CC5 and CC8. CC5 and
                    CC8 harbour the widest diversity of SCCmec elements, and some
                    of the most recently described types have only been found in these CCs (Figure 5). This is not related
                    to their overall abundance, i.e., to the statistical
                    probability of a gene transfer event. In contrast, MRSA from the equally
                    abundant CC15 [94] has only been described once, some 30 years ago [33]. Thus,
                        SCCmec elements from other species may be more readily
                    integrated into CC5 and CC8 than into other S. aureus lineages.
                    These two CCs might serve as some kind of “entry gate” of
                        SCCmec elements into the S. aureus gene
                    pool from which, possibly after some adaptations, these elements can be
                    transferred into other S. aureus lineages. The reason for this
                    is unclear, but peculiarities of, e.g., lineage-specific
                    restriction-modification systems which can control horizontal gene transfer into
                        S. aureus and between different S. aureus
                    could be scrutinised with in this regard.  Roman numerals indicate SCCmec types; PVL-negative
                            strains are shown with black letters on white background, PVL-positive
                            in white letters on black. A, ACME; F, SCCfus; M,

              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017936.g005 The epidemiology of MRSA has changed over the last two decades with the rise of
                    CA- and LA-MRSA harbouring a previously unknown variety of
                        SCCmec elements. It is tempting to speculate that the rise
                    of new strains was not only paralleled, but triggered by the emergence of these
                    elements, especially of SCCmec IV. Compared to other
                        SCCmec elements, SCCmec IV can be found in
                    a wide diversity of different S. aureus clonal lineages (Figure 5). Interestingly, it
                    is also the most common SCCmec element in S.
                        epidermidis. It has been detected in approximately 40% of
                    methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis from humans, which
                    belonged to wide variety of genetic backgrounds [229]; and it is also common
                    among coagulase-negative staphylococci from animals [230]. The evolutionary success
                    of this element might suggest either a better ability to be transmitted between
                    different strains, and even species, and/or lower fitness costs [7]; [8]. Recently, a
                    variety of “atypical” SCCmec elements have been
                    observed, some of which are described in this study. Whether they are variants
                    of previously known types or entirely new elements still needs to be determined.
                    However, these observations indicate that the spread and evolution of
                        SCCmec elements is still ongoing. This prompts the question
                    of where novel elements originated from. Apparently, these elements evolve
                    independently of the S. aureus genome they actually reside in.
                    Different SCCmec elements may be observed in otherwise
                    virtually identical strains, and strains from completely different clonal
                    complexes may acquire the same SCCmec elements. Similar to
                    other mobile genetic elements they could be considered as “selfish
                    genes” [231], i.e., as parasitic pieces of
                    genetic information which undergo their own evolution and compete against each
                    other, as previously discussed by Novick (“Mobile genetic elements are
                    arguably selfish in that their evolution is driven by selective forces that
                    operate on the elements themselves, independently of the host organisms within
                    which they must of necessity reside” [193]). However, contrary to
                    other “selfish” mobile genes (such as endogenous retroviruses in
                    eukaryotic genomes) they confer an advantage to their “host
                    organism” by introducing antibiotic resistance properties and even
                    additional virulence factors such as a recently discovered phenol-soluble
                    modulin [232].
                    The relative independence of such elements from host genomes also allows them to
                    reside in other species, and, indeed, a wide range of SCCmec
                    elements can be found in other staphylococci [229]. These bacteria provide
                    an ample pool of additional hosts for the SCCmec elements, and
                    it can be expected that novel elements may be transferred from other
                    staphylococci to S. aureus. For that reason, the evolution of
                    antibiotic resistance in bacteria infecting/colonising livestock is highly
                    relevant. Many animal species harbour S. aureus as well as
                    their own host-specific staphylococci (such as S. hyicus in
                    swine or S. pseudintermedius in dogs). Global livestock
                    populations now exceed the populations of most wild animals which might serve as
                    hosts for S. aureus. For example, there are 1,300 million
                    cattle, 900 million pigs, 500 million cats and 400 million dogs in the world
                        [http://www.cattle-today.com/, http://en.wikipedia.org]. Because of their close proximity to
                    humans, domestic animals might serve as reservoir for new strains as well as for
                    novel SCCmec elements. While some animal-specific S.
                        aureus such as ST151 have so far failed to evolve into MRSA or to
                    infect humans, others have truly zoonotic potential with the best documented
                    example being ST398-MRSA-V. Although PVL has been known for a long time [10]; [233], its occurrence in
                    MRSA strains is a recent phenomenon. Since PVL is phage-encoded, it can be found
                    in S. aureus belonging to many different clonal complexes.
                    Occurrence in diverse MSSA has been discussed previously [113]. PVL-positive MRSA are
                    found in clonal complexes or sequence types CC1, CC5, CC8, CC22, CC30, CC59,
                    ST72, CC80, CC88, ST93, ST154, ST398 and ST772 (Figure 5). Additionally, PVL-positive
                    ST45-MRSA have recently been reported [45]; [122]. As with
                        SCCmec elements, PVL phages undergo a host-independent
                    evolution. As a set of “selfish genes” they evolved to confer a
                    selective advantage to their staphylococcal hosts in helping them to cope with
                    the immune defences of the vertebrates in which these staphylococci parasitize.
                    Thus, these phages compensate their staphylococcal host for the fitness costs
                    they may cause. This strategy appears to be evolutionary successful as it
                    evolved on multiple occasions. Staphylokinase-encoding phages in S.
                        aureus can be regarded as another example. Staphylokinase improves
                    the fitness of S. aureus in the human host by facilitating
                    their entry into deeper host tissues and by inhibiting host defensins [234].
                        SCCmec elements also “pay” for being
                    transmitted and multiplied by helping their staphylococcal hosts to cope with
                    antibiotic compounds, which in a certain sense also belong to the defences of
                    the human host against staphylococcal infection. Some of the recently emerged PVL-positive MRSA strains are known to occur and
                    predominate in certain regions such as USA300 in the USA, ST80-MRSA-IV in Europe
                    and the Middle East, ST772-MRSA-V in India, ST59-MRSA-VT in Taiwan
                    and ST93-MRSA-IV in Australia. Cases outside these regions are increasingly
                    being reported. In part, this can be attributed to human travel activities.
                    Other PVL-positive strains have been found in multiple distant settings
                        (e.g., ST22-MRSA-IV in Bavaria, Germany, in Australian
                    patients of Indian origin, in Abu Dhabi and in Great Britain) which might
                    suggest a polyphyletic origin (see also [40]). Crudely, three
                    different epidemiological situations can be distinguished. First, in European
                    countries (such as Germany, [29]; ; the UK, [111]; Malta, [40] or
                    Ireland, [57]; [235]), the prevalence of PVL-MRSA is low and has remained
                    low for several years. In these countries, a variety of different strains can be
                    observed and individual cases can often be traced to travel histories or to the
                    foreign origin of patients. Thus, detection of such strains in travellers might
                    indicate an epidemic situation elsewhere, and should prompt a thorough
                    documentation of the patient's travel history. It may be speculated that an
                    overwhelming presence of successful PVL-negative clones (ST22-MRSA-IV and
                    ST398-MRSA-V) may hinder the dissemination of PVL-positive clones. However,
                    there are no data indicating whether these strains would prevail in direct
                    competition with a successful PVL-MRSA-clone, and generally it is not known
                    which properties might render a strain “successful”. Secondly, in
                    Australia or Abu Dhabi [31] PVL-MRSA are common and a number of different strains
                    co-exist. Since Australia as well as the Gulf Emirates witnessed a recent and
                    massive immigration of people from all over the world, it can be assumed that
                    these people have introduced epidemic strains from their respective home
                    countries. For instance, USA300 may have come with North American expatriates,
                    or ST772-MRSA-V from India [111]. Thirdly, another situation emerged in the USA,
                    where a single strain of PVL-MRSA (USA300) spread extensively and where this one
                    strain effectively marginalised all other strains, whether PVL-positive or not
                        [76].
                    Similarly, in Taiwan, most MRSA infections are caused by ST59-MRSA-VT[14]; [236]. A
                    comparable picture may currently evolve in Australia due to a massive increase
                    in ST93-MRSA-IV infections. The role of PVL in MRSA and especially in USA300 has been extensively and
                    controversially discussed [61]; [237]-[239], with particular
                    emphasis on the situation in the USA. However, other parts of the world harbour
                    other PVL-MRSA. If different strains from diverse clonal groups cause the same
                    distinct syndromes (such as chronic/recurrent SSTI in immunocompetent young
                    adults) the causative factor should be present in all of them. Thus, the
                    observation that, e.g., PVL-positive CC5, CC8 and CC30 isolates
                    can cause the same symptoms, but behave differently than essentially isogenic
                    but PVL-negative CC5, CC8 and CC30 strains rendered it improbable that a factor
                    other than PVL was the key marker of virulence in PVL-positive MRSA. As PVL-MRSA
                    belong to different agr-groups, a connection of the
                    evolutionary success of PVL-MRSA to agr group affiliation,
                        i.e., to peculiarities of gene regulation is also
                    improbable. The diversity and abundance of PVL-MRSA clones in Abu Dhabi and
                    Australia could also indicate that no USA300-specific factor besides PVL (such
                    as ACME) was necessary for the expansion of a PVL-MRSA clone. Thus, our
                    observations suggest that PVL plays a key role in the evolutionary success of
                    MRSA in a clearly defined ecological niche of chronic/recurrent SSTI in
                    otherwise healthy young adults and, rarely, of necrotising pneumonia. In
                    settings where PVL-MRSA is abundant, they also have been observed to cause,
                        e.g., bloodstream infections [240]. However, this can be
                    attributed to their overall abundance and to the relative rarity of other
                    strains, since PVL is thought not to contribute to the pathogenesis of
                    bloodstream infections [241]. The evolving issue of community-acquired and livestock-associated MRSA poses a
                    major public health threat. The biological diversity of MRSA is increasing and
                    this enables MRSA to move out of the small and relatively controllable
                    ecological niche of hospitals and intensive care units into the general
                    population of developed and developing nations and into livestock animals.
                    Consequently, it can no longer be considered an exclusive hospital-associated
                    problem, and it cannot be fought by hospital infection prevention and control
                    measures alone. Some of the MRSA strains may replace MSSA in a similar way as
                    penicillinase-positive strains replaced penicillinase-negative strains in the
                    1950s and 1960s. A consequence of such a development may be that β-lactam
                    antibiotics could only be used when proven to be effective,
                        i.e. not as an initial therapy but only after
                    susceptibility testing has been performed. This would result in an increased use
                    of antimicrobials which are more expensive and/or less effective and in dire
                    consequences for individual patients as well as for entire national healthcare
                    systems. Due to the increasing biodiversity of MRSA and the resulting exploitation of
                    novel ecological niches outside of hospitals it cannot be realistically expected
                    that MRSA might be eradicated easily. In order to check its current
                    proliferation, factors which confer advantage to MRSA need to be turned into a
                    disadvantage. Thus, carriage of mecA and/or PVL needs to be
                    “penalised” by consequent treatment, eradication and infection
                    prevention and control measures. Practically, a “search-and-destroy”
                    policy as in Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands and Western Australia is
                    warranted. This requires routine screening assays for mecA
                    and/or PVL as well as advanced typing techniques and we anticipate that the
                    methods and data from our study might contribute to this. A database of microarray experiments performed by the authors on more than 3,000
                    MRSA isolates has been used for this study. Isolates have been collected as part
                    of routine diagnostic work from the following sources: the Dresden University
                    Hospital (Saxony, Germany) and hospitals of Hoyerswerda (Saxony, Germany) and
                    Saarbrücken (Saarland, Germany), a variety of German intensive care units
                    (as part of the S.A.R.I. study, [242]), the “Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut”
                    (Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, Germany), the national MRSA
                    reference centres in London (UK), Lyon (France) and Dublin (Ireland), hospitals
                    in Ireland, Msida (Malta), Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates), Hong Kong (China),
                    Trinidad & Tobago and from the Gram-positive Bacteria Typing and Research
                    Unit, Perth (Australia). The majority of isolates were sampled between 2000 and
                    August 2010. A small number of older isolates were also included (such as for
                    ST247- and ST250-MRSA-I); this is mentioned in the text along with the strain
                    descriptions. Additionally, a collection of reference strains from the Network
                    on Antimicrobial Resistance in S. aureus (NARSA, Herndon,
                    Virginia, USA) was characterised, mainly to reflect the diversity of MRSA
                    strains in the USA. A few strains originated from other sources that are
                    acknowledged in the respective sections and in the Acknowledgments. Additional information on emerging MRSA strains and their geographic
                    distributions as reported in recent publications has also been included. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST), which is based on sequencing of internal
                    fragments of arcC, aroE, glpF, gmk, pta, tpi and
                        yqiL housekeeping genes, was performed on selected
                    isolates. The protocol used was as described by Enright et al.
                        [25]. The
                    sequences obtained were compared with those at the MLST website (http://saureus.mlst.net/) to assign a sequence type (ST).
                    Related sequence types were clustered to clonal complexes (CC) using BURST
                    analyses as provided on the MLST website. The spa typing procedures were performed according to previously
                    published protocols [243] using the nomenclature as described on the Ridom
                    website (http://spa.ridom.de/) and either the RIDOM or SPATYPEMAPPER
                    (freeware, download at http://www.clondiag.com/fileadmin/Media/Downloads/SPATypeMapper_0_6.zip)
                    software packages. The Alere StaphyType DNA microarray was employed using protocols and procedures
                    previously described in detail [29]; [ 96]. The DNA microarray covers 334 target sequences,
                    (approximately 170 distinct genes and their allelic variants) including species
                    markers, SCCmec, capsule and agr group typing
                    markers, resistance genes, exotoxins, and MSCRAMM genes. Primer and probe
                    sequences have been published previously [29]; [96]. Target genes and information on primers and probes are provided in Supplemental
                        file
                        S1. MRSA were grown on Columbia blood agar and incubated overnight at 37°C.
                    Culture material was enzymatically lysed prior to DNA preparation using
                    commercially available spin columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Purified DNA
                    samples were used as templates in a linear primer elongation using one primer
                    per target. All targets were amplified simultaneously, and within this step,
                    biotin-16-dUTP was incorporated into the resulting amplicons. An alternate
                    protocol was used for a few isolates in which amplification and labelling were
                    directed by random primers [139]; [244]. As this protocol does not rely on conserved primer
                    binding sites, it proved to be useful for characterisation of unusual strains
                    which are not fully represented by the published genome sequences
                        (e.g., ST75 strains). Amplicons obtained using either protocol were hybridised to the microarray
                    followed by washing and blocking steps, and the addition of
                    horseradish-peroxidase-streptavidin conjugate. After further incubation and
                    washing steps, hybridisations were visualised by using a precipitating dye. An
                    image of the microarray was taken and analysed using a designated reader and
                    software (ALERE Technologies GmbH, Jena, Germany). Normalised intensities of the
                    spots were calculated based their average intensities and on the local
                    background [96]. Results were regarded as negative if the normalised
                    intensity for a given probe was below 25% of the median value of species
                    markers (coa, eno, fnbA, gapA, katA, nuc, rrn, sarA sbi, spa,
                        vraS) and a biotin staining control. If the normalised intensity of
                    a given probe was higher than 50% of this breakpoint, it was interpreted
                    positive. If it was between 25% and 50%, the result was regarded
                    as ambiguous. For some markers, for which allelic variants were to be
                    discriminated (bbp, clfA, clfB and fnbB as
                    well as some set/ssl genes, isaB, mprF and
                        isdA), a different approach was used because these alleles
                    differed only in single nucleotides. Here, only the probe with the strongest
                    signal value was regarded as positive, provided that it exceeded the 50%
                    breakpoint. All others were regarded as ambiguous or, if below the 25%
                    breakpoint, as negative. This allowed an easy and clear distinction of clonal
                    complex-specific variants of these genes. Genes which are not present in all
                    tested isolates are labelled as rare, variable or common in Figures 2 and 3 as well as in Supplement S2 (see
                    legends). The affiliation of isolates to clonal complexes (CCs) or sequence types (STs) as
                    defined by MLST [25] was determined by an automated comparison of
                    hybridisation profiles to a collection of reference strains previously
                    characterised by MLST [29]; [96]. Analysis of hybridisation patterns cannot
                    discriminate sequence types which differ only in single point mutations
                    affecting MLST genes (e.g., ST5 and ST225, or ST59 and ST952).
                    However, there are also sequence types which originate from chromosomal
                    replacements as previously described [170]; [173]. As these events result in
                    different hybridisation patterns, such STs can be easily identified. MRSA
                    strains which belong to these sequence types will be described separately from
                    the parental CCs. The SCCmec elements were typed using previously described PCR
                    primers and conditions and by array hybridisation as described below. For PCR-based typing, structural architecture and mec-complex
                    were determined using the primers described by Zhang et al.,
                    2005 [132].
                        SCCmec type IV was further sub-typed using published
                    primers [245]. The cassette chromosome recombinase
                        (ccr) was typed as described previously [246]. An
                    ISau4-like transposase (GenBank accession number DQ680163) inserted into the
                    open reading frame V011 of SCCmec VT was detected by
                    the production of a ca. 1,600-bp PCR and confirmed by
                    sequencing [126]. All Irish MRSA isolates underwent SCCmec typing for (i) the
                        ccr and mec complex genes and (ii) the J
                    regions and mecI
                    [15]; [85]; [246]; [247]. In
                    addition, isolates harbouring SCCmec IV underwent
                        SCCmec IV sub-typing. Sub-typing of variant
                        SCCmec II and IV elements from Irish isolates was performed
                    as described previously [15]; [ 245]. The array includes probes for mecA, an accompanying gene,
                        ugpQ, mecI and xylR. Two
                    different probes for mecR1 allow the discrimination of
                    un-truncated mecR1 and truncated mecR1
                        (ΔmecR1). Four different alleles of ccrA and
                        ccrB (ccrA-1, ccrB-1, ccrA-2, ccrB-2, ccrA-3,
                        ccrB-3, ccrA-4 and ccrB-4) can be distinguished.
                    The gene ccrC and a “hypothetical protein”
                    accompanying ccrC form an additional pair of recombinase genes.
                    Because the latter is an analogue to ccrA, it is here
                    tentatively named “ccrAA”. Alleles from strain
                    85-2082 (GenBank AB037671) and strain MRSAZH47 (GenBank AM292304) can be
                    distinguished by different probes. While all SCCmec V strains
                    react with the former probe, only a part of them yield signals with probes for
                    the latter variant. This includes strains ST398-MRSA-V and Taiwan Clone
                        ST59-MRSA-VT which are known to harbour a distinct variant,
                        SCCmec VT (5C2&5). J-region genes dcs, pls-SCC and the
                        kdp-operon can also be detected. Other genes with relevance
                    for SCCmec are a mercury resistance operon, the tobramycin
                    resistance gene aadD, the macrolide, lincosamide and
                    streptogramin B resistance gene erm(A), the tetracycline
                    resistance gene tet(K) and the fusidic acid resistance marker
                    Q6GD50. However, as these genes are plasmid- or transposon-encoded, they are not
                    necessarily restricted to SCCmec elements. An overview on
                    hybridisation patterns associated with the different SCCmec
                    types is provided in Figure
                        1. In order to visualise similarities between hybridisation profiles, a network tree
                    using SplitsTree software [248] was constructed. Array hybridisation profiles of the
                    tested strains (Supplemental file S3) were converted into a series of
                    ‘sequences’ (Supplemental file S5). Each position in this
                    ‘sequence’, i.e., each probe, could have a value of
                    ‘positive’ (‘C’), ‘negative’
                    (‘G’), ‘ambiguous’ (‘A’) or
                    ‘variable’ (‘T’) with the latter including all these
                    markers which are in Supplemental file S3 designated as ‘rare’,
                    ‘variable’ or as ‘common’. These ‘sequences’
                    were used with SplitsTree version 4.11.3 on default settings (characters
                    transformation: uncorrected P/ignore ambiguous states, distance transformation:
                    Neighbour-Net, and variance: ordinary least squares). For CC15 and ST426, data
                    from MSSA [96] were used as no MRSA isolates were found. The scale
                    bar represents the number of differences between signal strings (with 0.1
                    meaning 10% difference). Due to the high rate of recombination affecting many genes covered by the array,
                    this tree does not reflect necessarily true phylogenetic relations. However, the
                    observation that strains of the same clonal complex cluster together indicates
                    that phylogenetic relationships indeed result in similar hybridisation patterns
                    and, on a practical level, that the hybridisation profile can be used to predict
                    CC affiliation [96]. Similarly, also CCs which are related according to
                    sequence analyses (e.g., CC22, CC30, CC45 and ST207, see [115]) also
                    cluster together. For comparison, a SplitsTree analysis of the concatenated MLST sequences
