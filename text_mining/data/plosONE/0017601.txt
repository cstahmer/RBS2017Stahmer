   The prognosis, specifically the case fatality and duration, of untreated
                        tuberculosis is important as many patients are not correctly diagnosed and
                        therefore receive inadequate or no treatment. Furthermore, duration and case
                        fatality of tuberculosis are key parameters in interpreting epidemiological
                        data. To estimate the duration and case fatality of untreated pulmonary
                        tuberculosis in HIV negative patients we reviewed studies from the
                        pre-chemotherapy era. Untreated smear-positive tuberculosis among HIV
                        negative individuals has a 10-year case fatality variously reported between
                        53% and 86%, with a weighted mean of 70%. Ten-year case
                        fatality of culture-positive smear-negative tuberculosis was nowhere
                        reported directly but can be indirectly estimated to be approximately
                        20%. The duration of tuberculosis from onset to cure or death is
                        approximately 3 years and appears to be similar for smear-positive and
                        smear-negative tuberculosis. Current models of untreated tuberculosis that assume a total duration of 2
                        years until self-cure or death underestimate the duration of disease by
                        about one year, but their case fatality estimates of 70% for
                        smear-positive and 20% for culture-positive smear-negative
                        tuberculosis appear to be satisfactory.

                    Organization. Funding involved time allocation of the authors and attendance to
                    two workshops discussing the estimates used to assess the burden of tuberculosis
                    in the scope of the Global Burden of Disease project. The funders had no role in
                    study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation
                    of the manuscript. Competing interests:  The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Before the advent of chemotherapy, tuberculosis was one of the major causes of death
                in both Western [1]
                and also several non-Western countries [2]. While effective chemotherapy
                for tuberculosis has been available since the 1950s (isoniazid (INH) was introduced
                in 1952, the less effective para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) and streptomycin slightly
                earlier [3]) the
                prognosis of untreated tuberculosis is still of great importance, as many patients
                will not receive appropriate treatment because their condition was never properly
                diagnosed as tuberculosis. For example, both the Cambodian [4] and Vietnamese [5] prevalence survey
                show that only about 20% of tuberculosis-patients identified in these surveys
                were on treatment at the time of the survey. This is especially true for
                smear-negative culture-positive pulmonary cases because in many places in the world
                Ziehl-Neelsen (Z-N) direct sputum smear, with low sensitivity for paucibacillary
                disease, is the only available diagnostic tool [6]. Also, many national
                tuberculosis programmes based on the DOTS (directly observed therapy, short course)
                strategy only offer free treatment to smear-positive cases in view of their
                disproportionate role in tuberculosis transmission and thus their large public
                health impact [7]. In
                addition, despite the availability of standard chemotherapy, with the recent
                increases in multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR)
                tuberculosis [8]
                many patients will have a prognosis that is in all likelihood not very different
                from untreated tuberculosis. This also holds true for tuberculosis, both drug
                susceptible and resistant, in HIV-positive patients, most of whom live in Sub-Sahara
                Africa, where adequate diagnosis and treatment is unavailable in many (especially
                rural) areas. Since a substantial number of tuberculosis cases will not receive
                adequate treatment the prognosis in terms of duration and outcome of (untreated)
                tuberculosis is an important parameter in models used for estimating the disease and
                mortality burden caused by tuberculosis [9], [10]. The prognosis of untreated tuberculosis is difficult to study these days as leaving
                patients untreated, especially in a study setting, is unethical. As an alternative,
                one could consider, as an approximation, the prognosis of multi-drug resistant (MDR)
                tuberculosis treated with first line drugs. However, MDR-tuberculosis patients may
                benefit to some extent from first line therapy [11]–[14] and many of these patients may
                have a history of tuberculosis treatment and may thus suffer from a relapse with
                secondary (acquired) drug resistance with a prognosis that may differ from that of
                those who never received tuberculosis treatment. Furthermore, Mycobacterium
                    tuberculosis strains resistant to rifampicin and INH might be less fit
                than drug susceptible strains and therefore lead to longer duration of disease with
                less mortality [15]. Therefore, to estimate the prognosis of HIV-negative
                tuberculosis, one inevitably has to rely on data collected in the pre-chemotherapy
                era even though many of those studies do not meet modern standards. To estimate the duration and case fatality of untreated pulmonary tuberculosis, we
                reviewed studies from the pre-chemotherapy era. For tuberculosis in HIV infected
                patients there are, of course, no data from the pre-chemotherapy era. Thus the only
                data that are potentially relevant are those on MDR-tuberculosis HIV positive
                patients treated with (inadequate) first line tuberculosis drugs, as their prognosis
                would probably be similar to that of untreated HIV positive tuberculosis. However,
                it is clearly important to distinguish patients by stage of HIV disease and by
                treatment (ART, type of ART, or not [16]). The complexity of this far
                exceeds that of estimating the prognosis in HIV- negative patients and requires
                separate reviews. We studied the duration until death or self-cure of untreated tuberculosis and 5- and
                10-year survival probabilities in representative adult populations (>15 yrs of
                age) with pulmonary tuberculosis, identifiable as either smear-positive or
                smear-negative. Not a single study has measured the duration of disease directly, as this would
                    require an exhaustive ascertainment of incident cases as well as a follow-up to
                    either death, which is easy to establish, or cure, which is more difficult to
                    establish, while withholding treatment, at least for some time. One thus has to
                    rely on indirect information to estimate duration of disease, on the assumption
                    that duration of disease (D) and case fatality (CF) are related to incidence
                    (I), prevalence (P) and mortality (M): D = P/I and
                    CF = M/I [17]. We defined four types of data sources which may contribute information on the
                    natural duration and/or outcome of disease: We searched PubMed including OldMedline with publications from the early decades
                    of the 20th century up to 17 December 2010 and EMBASE, including
                    references from 1900 until 1966. The search strategy is summarized in Table 1. These searches did,
                    for a variety of reasons (see below), not yield any eligible papers. Therefore,
                    additionally a snowball sampling method was applied, using reference lists of
                    various papers and books, starting with Hans Rieder's book
                    “Epidemiological Basis of Tuberculosis Control” [18],
                    supplemented with literature identified from the authors' personal
                    libraries [19]–[23]. We also asked the members of the tuberculosis expert
                    group of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk factors study (see
                    Acknowledgements for names) for suitable references. For practical reasons, we
                    only included papers in English, French, German, Spanish and Dutch. Papers in
                    other languages with English table and figure legends as well as an English
                    summary were also included.  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017601.t001 All references were first screened independently by two authors (ET and NN) on
                    title and, if no title was available, in the snowball sampling method, on
                    reference in the text to assess whether they potentially assessed the prognosis
                    of untreated pulmonary tuberculosis in representative adult populations. Of
                    potentially eligible papers, if available, abstracts were subsequently assessed
                    for eligibility using the same strategy. If no abstract was available, papers
                    were accessed in full text. Among the identified sources we selected those that
                    would potentially provide estimates of CF and/or duration of pulmonary
                    tuberculosis in adults (≥15 years) by any of the four methods outlined above.
                    Studies were included provided: a) their methodology was sound (e.g.
                    (near-to-)complete follow-up or making use of actuarial methods), considering
                    populations that can be considered as more or less
                    ‘population-based’ (thus not including only specific population
                    subgroups or pre-selecting certain categories of patients), b) they contained
                    original data (i.e., no editorials, opinion papers, minutes; reviews were only
                    included if the literature these referred to was not found), c) we could decide
                    whether patients included were smear-positive or smear-negative but
                    culture-positive; in studies where patients were described as having
                    “open” tuberculosis or “bacillary tuberculosis” before
                    1930 (when culture became available) we assumed that these patients were
                    smear-positive, d) description of the available data was sufficient to enable
                    calculation 5- and/or 10-year survival probabilities or disease duration, and e)
                    the study population was not treated with chemotherapy or was treated with
                    probably or proven ineffective therapy (e.g. collapse therapy, lung resection,
                    short duration mono-drug therapy, etc.). Eligibility and data extracted from all eligible sources were checked and
                    discussed by two authors (NN and ET) using the criteria described above. The
                    data sources were reviewed and summarized with respect to their information
                    regarding the duration and outcome of untreated tuberculosis, and CF.
                    Discrepancies between authors with respect to extracted data were resolved by
                    discussing the differences and independently re-reviewing the data. There are some important limitations to studying the duration and CF of untreated
                    tuberculosis, since many of the included studies do not meet modern research
                    standards. For example, the case definition, the onset of disease, or the
                    beginning of follow-up in cohort studies (onset of symptoms, sputum positivity)
                    are often ill-defined or poorly described in older publications, and many cases
                    included in those studies would not meet modern diagnostic standards. A large number of studies are based on passive case finding, which inevitably
                    entails some selection bias, as diagnosed cases may well differ from undiagnosed
                    ones. Some studies are limited to hospitalized (sanatoria) cases and therefore
                    presumably exclude both the mildest and the most severe cases, as some of the
                    latter probably died before they could have been hospitalized. An additional methodological problem constitutes the way cases have been
                    classified in old studies. Using the distinction of pulmonary tuberculosis into
                    sputum smear-positive (smear-positive) and sputum smear-negative
                    (smear-negative) cases, the most common classification used today, we must
                    assume (highly unrealistically) that the sensitivity and specificity of direct
                    smear has not changed. Especially the diagnosis of smear-negative cases is
                    problematic as culture using the Löwenstein-Jensen (L-J) medium did not
                    become available until the 1930s [24], [25] and thus all Z-N
                    smear-negative tuberculosis was diagnosed on the basis of radiology and/or
                    symptoms with uncertain specificity [26]. In some publications
                    cases are reported as having “open” tuberculosis without explicit
                    definition. This presumably depends on various non-standardized Z-N like
                    procedures of directly demonstrating M. tuberculosis in sputum.
                    A comparison between sputum smear microscopy used in those days with that
                    currently in use is not available. Another methodological problem, also
                    affecting many modern studies on tuberculosis, is the implicit assumption that
                    pulmonary tuberculosis can reliably be classified as either smear-positive or
                    smear-negative and that no transitions between these categories take place. This
                    is almost certainly untrue, if only because of the poor sensitivity of sputum
                    smear and its dependence on factors such as the number of repeat smears [14]. Yet, it is
                    well established that many smear-positive patients who become smear-negative in
                    the absence of adequate treatment subsequently relapse and become smear-positive
                    again [12].
                    Whether they are still culture-positive while being smear-negative or
                    temporarily “cured” (i.e. culture-negative) is largely unknown.
                    Presumably, some smear-negative patients who die will become smear-positive
                    prior to death, vitiating the assumption of stable categories. Yet how common
                    this is, remains unknown. Nevertheless, the classification into smear-positive
                    and smear-negative has become so widely established, and is so much part of the
                    methodology of estimating the burden of tuberculosis, that it is impossible to
                    avoid it. A further methodological pitfall is that by combining different estimates one
                    makes the implicit, and untested, assumption that the natural history of
                    tuberculosis does not differ significantly among countries and periods. However,
                    the risk of infection with M. tuberculosis and progression to
                    tuberculosis disease is influenced by host factors and especially risk of
                    progression depends on the hosts' immune status, which may be reduced due
                    to concomitant HIV infection, diabetes, and other underlying diseases [27], [28]. Given
                    these methodological challenges, it is clear that only by combining, often in an
                    ad-hoc fashion, different sources of information can one probably get somewhat
                    adequate or reasonable estimates of the “correct” duration and case
                    fatality (CF) of various types of tuberculosis. Data were extracted into Excel sheets and survival probabilities re-calculated
                    and provided with accompanying 95% Greenwood confidence intervals using
                    the original paper's life table's information. Where insufficient
                    details were available to recalculate survival probabilities, estimates as
                    calculated by the studies' authors were taken. Duration of active pulmonary
                    tuberculosis disease from diagnosis till death or cure could be assessed from
                    two studies with a very different study design [20], [29]. Because of the above-described methodological problems with combining the results
                    of such diverse studies, we did not attempt to do a formal meta-analysis
                    here. Using the methods described above we identified a wide range of studies on the
                    prognosis of tuberculosis in the absence of chemotherapy (Figure 1). In total, 2256 references were
                    identified of which 2171 (96%) were screened on title, abstract and/or
                    reference in the text. Of the 193 references selected for full-text reading, 84,
                    i.e. 43% (Note that.) were not available in consulted libraries. However,
                    32 of these references most probably do not contain any useful information, as
                    they had a very general title including only “tuberculosis” and
                    “mortality” or “research” or “annual report”
                    and appeared in regional journals or were old text books. Another 87 were
                    excluded after reading because they contained no original data [30]–[38] or the
                    selection [39]–[46], description and/or
                    classification of the patients included [21]–[23], [47]–[72], such as the number of smear-positive patients, or
                    (the description of) the available data [73]–[109] were
                    either insufficient, too rudimentary or different from current practice to be
                    useful to us (Figure 1). For
                    example, Elderton and Perry [47], [48] classified patients as “incipient”,
                    “moderately advanced”, “arrested” etc. without providing
                    sufficient details about these patients for us to decide what the operational
                    definition of such classification may have been nor whether these patients were
                    in all likelihood smear-positive or smear-negative culture-positive, or neither.
                    Other authors (e.g., [55], [60]) classified tuberculosis
                    according to three stages defined by Turban. Four papers were excluded because
                    all or part of the patients were treated with chemotherapy. Most of these papers
                    also did not contain sufficient follow-up time nor details to calculate 5-year
                    survival or duration of disease [10], [110]–[112].  Flowchart schematically showing inclusion and exclusion of papers. Those
                            marked with a * were excluded either because they were referred to
                            at places in the text that did not discuss duration of tuberculosis,
                            tuberculosis mortality, case fatality, life tables or natural history,
                            or because the title indicated that the paper was not about one of these
                            topics; ** for two of these, data were included to the extent
                            mentioned by Berg [115] (see legend of Table 3). 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017601.g001 The sources we considered relevant to the natural (pre-chemotherapy) history of
                    tuberculosis are listed in Table
                        2. The data sources cover different periods and different countries,
                    but except for two studies [29], [113], all are from the pre-chemotherapy era. All included
                    both sexes. Although sanatorium treatment and surgical therapy were available,
                    these are unlikely to have affected mortality by much [114]. The type of patients
                    included was highly variable in terms of diagnostic criteria (as explained
                    above, diagnostic criteria were often unclear) and age composition (if
                    reported). For example, the age distribution of the population included in the
                    study of Berg was 36%, 50% and 14% for men in the age
                    groups 15–24, 25–44, and 45 years and older, and 43%,
                    50% and 7% for women [115], whereas that of
                    Drolet's population was 23%, 45%, 33% and 36%,
                    46% and 18% for men and women respectively [116].  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017601.t002 1. Berg's study [115] is probably the most comprehensive study of all
                        the (retrospective) follow-up studies and has tried to include all patients
                        (including those ascertained after death) with “open”
                        tuberculosis from Gothenburg (Sweden) diagnosed between 1928 and 1934. He
                        followed all patients who were ever found to have bacilli in sputum from
                        diagnosis of tuberculosis. He identified various difficulties and biases
                        (e.g. “ascertainment” biases) in doing so. Berg also reviewed
                        earlier studies on the prognosis of tuberculosis and open tuberculosis more
                        specifically. However, the starting point of follow-up of most of these
                        patients is unclear and the studies usually included highly selected
                        patients (e.g. sanatorium, tuberculosis dispensary), and are thus less
                        representative than Berg's own material from Gothenburg [115]. We
                        included the relevant studies that were not available to us in full text
                        (Trail and Stockman (1931) [117], and Hartley, Wingfield and Burrows (1935) [118]), to
                        the extent summarized by Berg [115]. Trail and Stockman carried out a cohort study
                        in the UK among patients of the King Edward VII sanatorium in Midhurst (UK).
                        Hartley and colleagues did a retrospective cohort study of cases treated for
                        tuberculosis at Brompton Hospital. Only the pre-war (World War I) period is
                        presented here, as Berg considered the results of the period 1915-1931 being
                        less representative. 2. Sinding-Larsen [119] did a cohort study in Denmark among sanatorium
                        patients, with the objective of evaluating the impact of collapse
                        therapy. 3. Backer [120] followed patients notified to the Board of
                        Health in Oslo, Norway, between 1911 and 1920 until 1931 and reported
                        survival from date of notification, not date of diagnosis. 4. Krebs [121] considered pulmonary tuberculosis patients
                        discharged from Barmelweid sanatorium in Switzerland treated from its
                        opening in 1912 up to 1927. In his report patients are categorized according
                        to different categories/stages, including whether tuberculosis is open or
                        closed but he does not clarify the exact definitions of open and closed
                        tuberculosis. It is also unclear whether all closed tuberculosis patients
                        would meet the current definition of smear-negative culture-positive
                        tuberculosis. Probably, the study included patients diagnosed on the basis
                        of chest radiographs or clinical symptoms, as L-J medium was not yet
                        available. Five- and 10-year mortality rates of all 1464 patients who were
                        followed for at least 5 years (discharged between 1912 and 1924) were
                        re-calculated by Fürth [122]. 5. Tattersall [123], [124] included
                        sputum-positive cases attending Reading (UK) dispensary between 1914 and
                        1940 from the time of their diagnosis until death or up to 31 December
                        1945. 6. Magnusson [125] studied cases admitted for treatment at the
                        Vifillsstadir Sanatorium in Reykjavik, Iceland, recruited between 1916 and
                        1923 with a subsequent follow-up time reaching up to 1935. Cases of
                        ‘closed’ and open tuberculosis were reported separately. 7. Rutledge and Crouch [19] reported on the follow up of tuberculosis
                        patients discharged from a particular sanatorium in the United States of
                        America (USA). Smear-positive and smear-negative (note: not necessarily
                        culture-positive) cases were reported separately. 8. Münchbach [126] included sanatorium patients with open bacillary
                        tuberculosis, which should probably be interpreted as smear-positive
                        tuberculosis. 9. Braeuning and Neisen [127], [128] included
                        tuberculosis dispensary patients from Szczecin, Poland (then known as
                        Stettin, Germany) from two periods, 1920-21 and 1927-28 from the date of
                        their first positive sputum. 10. Griep [129] followed-up all notified cases of open pulmonary
                        tuberculosis occurring in The Hague, The Netherlands during a 18-year period
                        (1920-1937). Although cultures were being performed, only those who had at
                        least one positive sputum smear were included in his analyses. He estimated
                        that about 62% of all tuberculosis patients were notified, with
                        overrepresentation of those in the lowest socio-economic classes, since
                        those in higher classes probably sought private care. 11. Baart de la Faille [130] explored the
                        outcome of tuberculosis cases hospitalized in the Sanatorium “Berg en
                        Bosch” in The Netherlands. He distinguished three different groups of
                        patients based on sputum smear results at admission and during the last two
                        months before discharge: positive/positive, positive/negative and
                        negative/negative patients. Cultures were being done from 1931 onwards and
                        smear-negative culture-positive patients were added to the negative/negative
                        group, this group thus being a mixture of culture-positive and
                        culture-negative patients. Results from 1936 show that 30% of the
                        negative/negative group in fact had negative smear(s) but one or more
                        positive cultures. 12. Buhl and Nyboe [131] reported on mortality among Danish tuberculosis
                        patients diagnosed between 1925 and 1954. Only patients for whom bacilli had
                        been demonstrated in sputum or gastric washings were included. However, it
                        is not stated by which method bacilli were demonstrated. We therefore only
                        used data from patients diagnosed between 1925 and 1929
                        (N = 314) as for this period L-J culture was not
                        available yet and all the patients must have been smear-positive. The
                        decline in mortality that they observe during the pre-chemotherapy era
                        suggests that after 1930 some patients were smear-negative
                        culture-positive. 13. Lindhardt [132] reported on tuberculosis mortality in Denmark
                        between 1925 and 1934. All notified cases and all notified smear-positive
                        cases were reported separately. As the category “all cases” may
                        include cases for whom no smear result was available (in addition to
                        smear-negative patients), we only considered smear-positive cases. 14. Thompson [133] included all sputum-positive tuberculosis
                        patients occurring in a compact industrial area in Middlesex County, UK,
                        diagnosed between 1928 and 1938. The study of the National Tuberculosis Institute, Bangalore, India (NTI)
                            [29]
                        involved a series of 4 waves of community surveys in the South of India. The
                        study clearly documents its (more modern) methods and is based on systematic
                        surveys. Pamra [113] and colleagues used very similar methodology in
                        four survey waves following the National Sample Survey in New Delhi. Both
                        studies looked at the (bacteriological) status of survivors during follow-up
                        survey waves and included patients with any chest radiograph abnormalities
                        (screening) who were either positive on direct smear (Z-N/fluorescence
                        microscopy) and/or L-J culture. As such, these are the only studies that
                        included smear-negative, culture-positive patients. In the NTI study, the
                        fractions of smear-negative culture-positive patients were 53.4%,
                        53.0%, 55.1% and 41.4% in the subsequent 4 surveys. In
                        the other study, the fraction of smear-negative culture-positive cases was
                        lower in the first two surveys (24% and 30%) and similar in
                        the subsequent surveys [113], which may suggest changes in tuberculosis
                        epidemiology, capturing cases earlier in the development of active
                        tuberculosis, or in practice of culturing. Unfortunately, the reporting of both studies leaves much to be desired. For
                        example, prognosis (death or cure) is not presented broken down by Z-N
                        status (i.e. for smear-positive and smear-negative separately). Moreover,
                        Pamra and colleagues did not give any information about treatment of
                        tuberculosis [113], whereas the NTI study reported that no
                        organized anti-tuberculous treatment was available in the area, and that the
                        study did not provide chemotherapy (except for one month of INH monotherapy
                        at the second and third survey) which was highly unethical given the fact
                        that effective treatment was available at the time of the study. INH was
                        definitely available to some patients in that part of India as the authors
                        discovered a high percentage of INH drug resistance, which again clearly
                        indicates that patients could have been provided with full chemotherapy in
                        this study. In all likelihood treatment was only adequate in some
                        exceptional cases and otherwise of such a low quality that its impact can be
                        ignored [29]. Drolet [116] reported overall mortality ratios (i.e. the
                        ratio of mortality to notification as reported by the departments of Health
                        of the various cities and states in the USA, and the Ministry of Health in
                        the case of the UK) for New York (pulmonary), Chicago (all forms), Detroit
                        (pulmonary), New Jersey (all forms), Philadelphia (all forms, including
                        childhood tuberculosis), Massachusetts (pulmonary), and England and Wales
                        (pulmonary) during the period 1915-35. Braeuning [134] similarly reported
                        population rates, notification rates of new ‘open’ tuberculosis
                        cases and tuberculosis mortality in Stettin between 1925 and 1929. The Framingham Community Health and Demonstration project [20],
                            [135]–[137] was an extensive
                        community based project on tuberculosis epidemiology and prevention
                        initiated in 1916 in the same community that later became the focus of the
                        famous Framingham Heart Study. Several publications report on its findings.
                        Although we did not identify any systematic follow-up of patients, data on
                        the relationship between prevalence and mortality are provided. Direct estimates are available from cohort studies. Table 3 shows 5- and 10-year survival
                        rates from all cohort studies considered in this review. Only one study
                            [125] provided follow-up findings for periods of more
                        than 10 years and showed that mortality rate declined with time since
                        diagnosis. Between 10 and 20 years, mortality for both open and closed
                        tuberculosis dropped to 3.4%, which must have been close to the
                        mortality of non-tuberculous persons. Thus, it seems plausible to assume
                        that almost all mortality will occur within 10 years of onset of disease or
                        diagnosis. Even if the mortality rate and self-cure rate (µ and γ
                        respectively) were constant, i.e. independent of time since onset of
                        disease, the fraction (self) cured among those still alive after 10 years
                        would be
                        (γ/(γ+µ))(1-exp(-(γ+µ)10))/{(γ/(γ+µ))(1-exp(-(γ+µ)10))+exp(-(γ+µ)10)}
                        (which will be close to 1 for values of γ and µ that are
                        consistent with observed 5- and 10-year CF of approximately 59% and
                        70% respectively (as for smear-positive tuberculosis, see below).  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017601.t003 In studies that reported on this (particularly Berg [115] who reports a
                        30.7% mortality during the first year of follow-up) mortality tended
                        to be highest shortly after diagnosis. This decline in risk with time is
                        also apparent from Table
                            3 as 10-year survival probabilities tend to be better than the
                        square of the 5-year survival probabilities, as would be obtained with
                        constant mortality rates (risk of dying among those still alive). As cures
                        were not recorded, it is unclear whether this decline is due to a decline in
                        the mortality rate among those still having active tuberculosis, or whether
                        this is due to a decline in the number of people still diseased, so that the
                        denominator gets progressively inflated by cured patients. Nevertheless, although mortality rates decline, long-term survivorship (of 10
                        years or more) is much poorer (a 10-year CF of 70% or more) than
                        5-year survival showing that tuberculosis can be a very long-lasting,
                        chronic disease. Taking the crude unweighted average of all studies one
                        arrives at a 5-year case fatality of 58% and a 10-year case fatality
                        of 73% for open (smear-positive) tuberculosis. Taking an average
                        weighted by sample size these numbers are 55% and 72%
                        respectively. Of course, these mortality data are somewhat distorted by
                        mortality from other causes, as most studies do not record cause of death,
                        and all-cause mortality rates may have been somewhat higher in the
                        pre-antibiotic era than they are now. On the basis of the above data,
                        especially the studies by Berg [115], Thompson [133], and
                        Buhl and Nyboe [131] which – unlike studies on sanatorium
                        patients – appear to be mostly population based, a 30% 10-year
                        survival for smear-positive patients, i.e. a 70% CF, as used by WHO
                        and others in their estimates of the burden of tuberculosis [27], seems
                        a reasonable ballpark figure. As tuberculosis is mostly a disease of young
                        to middle-aged adults the distortion by other causes of death is probably
                        small. A single, aggregate, CF for all smear positive patients is only justified if
                        in most studies the differences in mortality between the sexes and age
                        groups are rather small. This appears to be the case for sex, but higher
                        ages appear to have somewhat poorer prognosis. For example, in Berg's
                        study (providing the most detailed data), age- and sex specific 10-year
                        mortality rates were 66% for men aged 15–29 years, 70%
                        for men aged between 30 and 49 years, and 94% for men of 50 and
                        older. For women, these rates were 70%, 69%, and 92%
                        respectively [115]. Similar patterns are apparent in other studies
                        providing age (but often using different age-groups) and sex specific
                        mortality. Braeuning [134] reported a ratio of mortality to notification (RMN)
                    for ‘open’ tuberculosis of 70%. This was adjusted for
                    mortality arising from not-previously notified tuberculosis cases by identifying
                    the number of tuberculosis deaths that had been notified as tuberculosis cases
                    previously, but not for changes in either population or incidence over time. Drolet [116]
                    reported RMNs of approximately 43% for New York City and Detroit,
                    approximately 32% for Chicago, 51%–52% for both New
                    York State and New Jersey, and 55% for Philadelphia. For Massachusetts
                    and England/Wales mortality to notification ratios of 54% were reported.
                    Percentages in all areas were approximately stable over the period for which
                    data are provided, with the possible exception of England and Wales where
                    declines in RMNs were observed. Cases in New York City, Chicago, and
                    England/Wales (from 1923 onwards) also include those first identified from death
                    certificates, all others areas include “primary” notifications only.
                    As this was a period of general decline in tuberculosis incidence, RMNs may
                    slightly overestimate CF as the deaths occur among tuberculosis patients who
                    were incident cases several years earlier and thus the number of deaths in any
                    year would exceed the number of future deaths that would (ultimately) occur
                    among incident cases in that year. In addition, some additional overestimation
                    may be possible if mortality data were more complete than notification data.
                    Pulmonary forms were diagnosed by Z-N smear and chest X-ray and/or clinical
                    symptoms and do not necessarily only include L-J culture-positive cases. The
                    proportion of smear-positive cases was not presented. Variations in CF among
                    regions may well be due to differences in diagnostic methods, reporting systems,
                    inclusion of cases from death certificates, etc., rather than true heterogeneity
                    in prognosis. The only conclusion that stands out from these data is that the
                    prognosis of all forms of (pulmonary) tuberculosis is much better that that of
                    smear-positive cases only. The CF of pulmonary tuberculosis, smear-positive and/or culture-positive, can
                        also be estimated from the NTI study [29] which comprised 4
                        successive waves of surveys. Diagnosis was by both smear and culture among
                        those with chest radiograph abnormalities. This study reports on: i)
                        prevalence of tuberculosis at each survey, stratified by smear status; ii)
                        the incidence between surveys, i.e. new cases at each survey among those
                        free of tuberculosis at previous surveys, outcome (dead, alive and excreting
                        bacilli, or not excreting bacilli) of prevalent cases at each survey during
                        the subsequent survey; iii) the outcome of prevalent cases at the first
                        survey during all subsequent surveys; iv) the outcome of prevalent cases at
                        each survey during the subsequent survey; v) the outcome of incident cases
                        at each survey at the subsequent survey, i.e. 1.5 years later; vi) the
                        relapse ‘rate’ (which was actually a proportion). The
                        presentation of some of the data in the paper is misleading. Notably, the
                        reported (approximately) 50% 5-year mortality, which is also reported
                        in the abstract of the paper, is incorrect. The reason for this is that
                        loss-to-follow up is inadequately accounted for, and disproportionately
                        affects surviving patients. Once a patient is observed to have died he can
                        no longer become lost to follow-up. A simple comparison of data on the
                        cohort of patients identified at survey 1 (Their Fig. 2. Fate of
                            cases discovered at the first survey and of patients still excreting
                            bacilli when examined at subsequent surveys) with data on the
                        fate of patients present at each survey (Their Fig. 3. Fate of
                            prevalence cases discovered at survey I, II, and III over a period of
                            1.5 years) shows this. In Fig. 2 mortality of those discovered
                        at survey I, after 1.5 years is 30.2%, while in Fig. 3 it is
                        24.7%. Another shortcoming of the paper is that patients without
                        abnormalities on chest radiograph were not examined in this survey and thus
                        not identified. The percentage of pulmonary tuberculosis patients without
                        chest radiograph abnormalities varies between 3 [138] and 50% [139]. There is a better approach to estimating the CF from the NTI data.
                        Ultimately, all tuberculosis patients will either die or get cured. If the
                        ratio of the mortality rate to the cure rate is independent of disease
                        duration, then one can simply look at the ratio of the number of deaths to
                        number of patients cured over a fixed period of follow-up. This assumption
                        seems to be supported by their data (their Fig. 2), as the cured-to-death
                        ratio among the cohort of tuberculosis patients discovered at survey 1 seems
                        to remain about equal at 27.8/30.2, to 23.6/20.0 to 17.2/15.0 in the
                        intervals between survey 1 and 2, between survey 2 and 3, and between survey
                        3 and 4 respectively. Thus, the prognosis (outcome) of the
                        participants' disease (death or cure) did not seem to depend on the
                        time they had already suffered from tuberculosis. Nevertheless, an exception
                        may have to be made for incident tuberculosis patients who appear to fare
                        somewhat better than prevalent cases, with a cured-to-death ratio of
                        44/24. The study reports a total of 428 (often overlapping) individuals alive with
                        tuberculosis at the beginning of any of the 1.5-year intervals. During the
                        subsequent 1.5 years, a total of 89 died and 132 were cured, suggesting an
                        (ultimate) tuberculosis mortality of 40.2%. However, this is not
                        entirely correct as the paper reports 7% mortality among “cured
                        cases” (most presumably dying from tuberculosis) and a “relapse
                        rate” of 10%. We thus subtract 17% from 132 giving 109.5
                        and add 7% of 132 to 89 giving 98. Thus if the fate of prevalent
                        cases would equal that of incident cases, 47% would ultimately
                        die. The assumption, as stated above, that there is a constant death-to-cure ratio
                        may not be entirely true, as among follow-up incident cases
                        there were almost twice as many cured cases (44) as deaths (24). This
                        ignores relapses. However, as the proportion dying (35%) among those
                        who either die or get cured in these incident cases differs only marginally
                        (and statistically not significantly) from the uncorrected (for relapse)
                        mortality of prevalent cases (40.2% of those who either die or get
                        cured), we seem to be justified assuming a constant death-to-cure rate. Thus
                        our ‘best’ estimate of tuberculosis CF from this study is
                        47%. Unfortunately, it is not possible to estimate the CF for smear-positive and
                        smear-negative tuberculosis separately from the data provided. If we accept
                        an ultimate mortality of smear-positive tuberculosis of 70% (based on
                        the studies presented elsewhere in this paper) then assuming that 50%
                        of cases are smear-positive (of all prevalent cases,
                        51% were smear-positive [29], but what counts is
                            incident cases which are unidentifiable from their
                        data, so this assumption is questionable) then (ultimate) mortality among
                        smear-negative pulmonary patients would be 24%. Thus the 20%
                        mortality for smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis, as assumed by WHO and
                        others in their estimates of the burden of tuberculosis (Table 4) seems a
                        reasonable figure.  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017601.t004 The duration of disease is the time from onset of disease till cure or death. For
                    tuberculosis, it is not possible to measure exactly when it started, as patients
                    may remain asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms shortly after getting the
                    disease. Moreover, of the two possible end points, cure is hard to measure, as
                    relapses are common [140] and establishing cure in untreated tuberculosis
                    patients requires extensive medical investigations. No single study reports on
                    the duration of disease by systematic follow-up of incident cases so we had to
                    estimate duration indirectly. Duration of disease can be estimated indirectly from the ratio of prevalence
                        to mortality. The Framingham Community Health and Tuberculosis Demonstration
                            [20], [135]–[137]
                        reported a presence of approximately 9 active (presumably a combination of
                        smear-positive, smear-negative culture-positive, and other forms
                        tuberculosis) living cases to every death, and 3 smear-positive cases for
                        every death. Assuming a long term mortality of 70% among
                        smear-positive and 16% mortality among all others (i.e. assuming that
                        active smear-negative cases are similar to Krebs' closed tuberculosis
                            [121],
                        as both presumably included cases with only chest radiograph abnormalities
                        in addition to culture-positives) one obtains a CF of 0.34, and an average
                        duration of 3 years. On the basis of this study it is impossible to stratify
                        by smear and culture status. The duration of disease in the pre-chemotherapy era was only studied
                        prospectively in one other study, viz. the NTI study [29]. As
                        follow-up of prevalent cases does not provide reliable data about duration
                        of disease, the best approach to estimate this parameter would be the
                        prevalence-to-incidence ratio which is (almost) 4. This is very close to the
                        ratio found for bacillary (i.e., sputum and/or culture positive) pulmonary
                        tuberculosis in New Delhi, India over the period 1962–1970 [113] using
                        similar methodology as the NTI study. Unfortunately, availability of
                        treatment, affecting the duration of disease, was not reported on;
                        therefore, we cannot include the study to estimate the duration of untreated
                        tuberculosis. As waves of surveys in the NTI study were 1.5 years apart (even 2 years for
                        the interval between wave 3 and 4) [29], one has to adjust
                        for missed incident cases, i.e. for the incident cases who recovered,
                        migrated out or died before being detected in one of the surveys. If we
                        would assume an exponential duration of disease with parameter δ (the
                        inverse of the duration of disease), then in an interval of length T (1.5
                        years) we would observe a fraction (1-exp(-δT))/(δT) of the
                        intervening incident cases at the following survey. Under these assumptions
                        an average duration of 3.33 years (i.e. δ = 0.3)
                        would fit the NTI data almost perfectly. Perhaps, the number missed between
                        surveys may be slightly larger due to non-exponential survival
                        (specifically, incident cases recovering or dying on average faster than
                        prevalent cases). If so, 3.3 years would slightly overestimate the duration
                        of disease. We infer that an average duration of approximately 3 years of
                        smear-positive and smear-negative cases combined would seem the most
                        plausible estimate. There is almost no reliable information regarding the relative duration of
                        smear-positive and smear-negative tuberculosis disease. A study from South
                        India [141]
                        provides some insight in the natural duration of smear-positive tuberculosis
                        as the authors give the ratio between incidence and prevalence for these
                        patients. They estimated a ratio of 0.46 corresponding to an average
                        duration of 2.2 years. This is considerably shorter than the mean duration
                        estimated in the NTI study in Bangalore for the mix of smear-positive and
                        smear-negative patients, suggesting a much shorter duration for
                        smear-positive than for smear-negative patients. However, as the study was
                        carried out in the 1980s it seems likely that the average duration must have
                        been shortened by available chemotherapy (INH plus thiacetazone), as was
                        also suggested by the authors of the paper. This is also supported by
                        another study carried out in South India [142] where the
                        incidence of culture-positive tuberculosis was 1,578 and that of
                        smear-positive culture-positive tuberculosis 726/100,000 (V. Kumaraswami,
                        personal communication), supporting the assumption that approximately
                        50% of both incident and prevalent cases of culture
                        confirmed tuberculosis are smear-positive. Overall this seems to support the
                        notion that the natural duration of smear-positive and smear-negative
                        disease are roughly similar. In our study we combined available information on untreated tuberculosis to
                    estimate its case fatality and duration of disease. We found only few studies
                    from the pre-chemotherapy era that allow for estimation of CFs and duration of
                    disease of smear-positive tuberculosis. Given the limited information available
                    and assuming that a 10-year CF will closely approximate lifetime CF, we conclude
                    that (lifetime) CF in untreated smear-positive tuberculosis among HIV negative
                    individuals is approximately 70% and about the same for both sexes.
                    Mortality seems to be approximately independent of age until the age of 50 years
                    after which it increases, perhaps due to concomitant complicating diseases such
                    as diabetes or cancer and a greater mortality from other causes. However, this
                    age effect would only be important in (patient) populations with a dramatically
                    different age structure than the ones used in this review. For most high burden
                    countries this is not the case. For culture-positive smear-negative tuberculosis, lifetime CF is probably
                    slightly over 20%, although this could only be estimated indirectly and
                    with uncertain precision. The duration of tuberculosis from onset to cure or death is approximately 3 years
                    and appears to be grossly similar for smear-positive and smear-negative
                    tuberculosis. Because of the expected heterogeneity between studies with respect to study
                    design and population, study period, duration and intensity of follow-up,
                    definition of pulmonary tuberculosis (‘open’/‘closed’,
                    bacillary/abacillary, smear-positive/smear-negative), etc., we did not do a
                    formal meta-analysis. Additional heterogeneity among studies may also exist in
                    patient selection and diagnostic procedures, for example the number of sputum
                    samples analyzed and how these were obtained (e.g. induced or spontaneous).
                    However, these data were hardly ever reported in the included studies. Despite the fact that (HIV negative) tuberculosis has for centuries been a major
                    cause of mortality, the number of studies on its natural history is surprisingly
                    low. This contrasts sharply with, for example, HIV for which detailed information on
                    its natural history became available within decades of the discovery of the
                    virus. Long term follow-up studies of HIV patients in carefully monitored
                    cohorts have generated this information. In contrast, follow-up of most
                    tuberculosis patients is nowadays usually limited to the duration of their
                    treatment. Another limitation is our serious lack of knowledge on the prognosis of
                    extra-pulmonary and smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis as most data on the
                    natural history are available for patients who tested sputum smear-positive. No
                    reliable prospective data on smear-negative culture-positive pulmonary patients
                    are available and their long term survival can only be estimated indirectly and
                    thus with great uncertainty. These patients form currently the group most likely
                    to receive no or inadequate treatment, and may well account for large proportion
                    of tuberculosis deaths. The prognosis of untreated extra-pulmonary patients - a
                    very heterogeneous group that also includes most tuberculosis in children - is
                    even more uncertain, and insufficient data were identified to include it in our
                    review. An important limitation of using electronic databases going back in time is that
                    these do not include abstracts and searches therefore may miss potentially
                    eligible papers. We have tried to obviate this by including quite general search
                    terms (see Table 1).
                    However, this way of searching yielded many references
                    (n = 1560), 43 of which were selected for reading and
                    available in full-text, but none of which was eligible for inclusion into our
                    review. We therefore supplemented our search strategy with snowball sampling. A
                    limitation of this approach is that it depends, perhaps heavily so, on its
                    starting point. We choose dr. Rieder's book [18] as the starting point since
                    it is known for its thoroughness with respect to discussing all important
                    aspects of tuberculosis and inclusion of (older) literature. Although this
                    approach may have lead to some underrepresentation of e.g. American and
                    francophone literature, this latter strategy yielded 22 eligible papers whereas
                    the electronic searches did not yield any useful references. Quite some of the identified potentially eligible papers were not available to
                    us. In theory, this may have influenced the outcome of our review. However, we
                    were able to identify papers appearing in a variety of journals, text books and
                    published as reports (‘grey literature’) and did not find any
                    evidence for a correlation between the type of source and the quality of the
                    data. Therefore, we expect no important ‘availability bias’
                    correlated with prognosis of untreated tuberculosis. Another limitation of our review is that most of the included studies on CF were
                    on predominantly Caucasian populations whereas most untreated patients currently
                    are of different ethnicity. This is probably mainly due to the fact that
                    evaluating the natural history of tuberculosis requires long term follow-up
                    which has proven to be difficult, especially in resource constrained
                    settings. A key limitation is that we had to restrict our review to HIV-negative patients,
                    as explained in the introduction. This does
                    not imply that no information on the prognosis of tuberculosis in HIV-positive
                    patients is available. For example, two relevant systematic reviews have been
                    carried out recently: one on any form of tuberculosis in people with HIV
                    infection [143], and one on HIV and MDR-tuberculosis [144]. The
                    prognosis of the latter type of patients likely resembles that of untreated
                    patients. If we exclude data on patients receiving ART, because of the
                    heterogeneity in ART regimes and ART resistance patterns - both between and
                    within countries, then we can at least explore the prognosis of HIV co-infected
                    tuberculosis patients. As regards CF, the review of Payne and Bellamy [143] provided no
                    information on the prognosis of HIV positive MDR-tuberculosis patients. However,
                    it identified several sources on tuberculosis in HIV patients from the pre-ART
                    era. One from the USA found a median survival of tuberculosis patients,
                    including patients with drug susceptible tuberculosis, of 16 months [145]. However,
                    only 13% of patients died from tuberculosis, the others from other AIDS
                    related diseases. Development of tuberculosis may thus be a marker for being
                    severely immunocompromised. Another study, from Malawi, found a mortality of
                    47% among patients followed-up for 32 months [146]. Thus, HIV infected
                    patients with tuberculosis not treated with ART, have a poor prognosis. The
                    other review [144] identified 8 sources of HIV associated
                    MDR-tuberculosis outbreaks. Five of these were from the USA where second line
                    tuberculosis treatment is presumably available and adequate, and these studies
                    thus did not represent “untreated” tuberculosis. This also appeared
                    from case fatality rates which were lower than those from outside the USA. The
                    other three studies were from Italy (N = 116) [147], Spain
                    (N = 48) [148], and Argentina (N = 124) [149]. The
                    studies from Italy and Argentina both reported that second line treatment was
                    not adequate, while the use of second line drugs was not reported in the study
                    from Spain. Reported mortality was between 93% (Argentina) and 98%
                    (Spain), and time to death was short. In the Spanish study the mean time from
                    diagnosis to death of the 47 who died was 77.6 days [148]. In the Italian study the
                    median time to death was reported as 93 and 79 days for the two participating
                    hospitals [147].
                    The Argentinean study only reported that half of the patients survived less than
                    5 weeks and that 1-year survival was as low as 5% [149]. As regards the duration of disease, findings from these studies [143], [144], [146]–[149] suggest that untreated
                    tuberculosis in HIV infected patients must be rapidly fatal, with a mean
                    survival of less than 6 months. However, a limitation of the use of these
                    patients is that all suitable reports were on nosocomial outbreaks among
                    hospitalized HIV patients. Such patients may be more immunocompromised than the
                    “average” HIV patient who develops tuberculosis, and alternative
                    approaches to estimate the prognosis of tuberculosis in various types of HIV
                    infected patients should be developed. While pre-chemotherapy data appeared to be a useful source of data for the
                    prognosis of untreated tuberculosis, inevitably questions remain. Particularly,
                    the impact of risk factors other than (variably defined) smear status was hard
                    to explore systematically. Perhaps, long-term follow-up of patients with
                    inadequately treated MDR or XDR tuberculosis may fill some of the gaps in our
                    knowledge. Such follow-up may also fill other gaps in our knowledge such as the
                    frequency of transitions between smear-positive and smear-negative tuberculosis
                    and the prognosis and duration of HIV-positive tuberculosis. We thank dr. Ana Bierrenbach, dr. Philippe Glaziou and dr. Ikushi Onozaki from the
