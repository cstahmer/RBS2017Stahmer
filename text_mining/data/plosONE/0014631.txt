                encompass three different oceanic domains—the Caribbean, the Pacific, and the
                Atlantic—ranging in latitude from 12°N to 55°S. The 10 countries that
                border these coasts have different research capabilities and taxonomic traditions
                that affect taxonomic knowledge. This paper analyzes the status of knowledge of
                marine biodiversity in five subregions along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of
                South America (SA): the Tropical East Pacific, the Humboldt Current, the Patagonian
                Shelf, the Brazilian Shelves, and the Tropical West Atlantic, and it provides a
                review of ecosystem threats and regional marine conservation strategies. South
                American marine biodiversity is least well known in the tropical subregions (with
                the exception of Costa Rica and Panama). Differences in total biodiversity were
                observed between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans at the same latitude. In the north
                of the continent, the Tropical East Pacific is richer in species than the Tropical
                West Atlantic, however, when standardized by coastal length, there is very little
                difference among them. In the south, the Humboldt Current system is much richer than
                the Patagonian Shelf. An analysis of endemism shows that 75% of the species
                are reported within only one of the SA regions, while about 22% of the
                species of SA are not reported elsewhere in the world. National and regional
                initiatives focusing on new exploration, especially to unknown areas and ecosystems,
                as well as collaboration among countries are fundamental to achieving the goal of
                completing inventories of species diversity and distribution. These inventories will
                allow accurate interpretation of the biogeography of its two oceanic coasts and
                latitudinal trends, and will also provide relevant information for science based
                policies. The marine areas of the South American continent extend for almost 30,000 km of
                    coastline and encompass three different oceanic domains—the Caribbean, the
                    Pacific, and the Atlantic. The latitudinal and longitudinal ranges within this
                    region are similarly wide, from 12°N to 55°S, and from 34° to
                    81°W. Ten countries border on these coasts, each with different research
                    capabilities and taxonomic traditions; therefore, taxonomic knowledge differs
                    among countries. Coastal biodiversity is strongly influenced by the physical and
                    geological history of these coasts. The eastern tropical Pacific region, which
                    encompasses the continental coasts of southern Central America (Costa Rica and
                    Panama) and of northwestern South America (Colombia and Ecuador) is
                    characterized by cliffs alternating with pocket beaches, alluvial and deltaic
                    plains with extensive sandy beaches, well-developed mangrove forests, estuaries,
                    lagoons, and, reefs. It also includes important offshore island systems such as
                    the Pearl and Galapagos islands [1], [2]. The Peruvian coast also is diverse with bays, cliffs,
                    kelp and macroalgal beds, rocky shores and sandy beaches, islands, and
                    peninsulas, as well as wetlands, which include the southernmost limit to the
                    tropical Pacific mangrove ecosystem [3], [4]. The Chilean coast is
                    4,500 km of mainly rocky shores, but does include some sandy-beach bays with
                    channels and archipelagos toward the south (Patagonian region) [5], [6]. Some of
                    the most diverse ecosystems in Chile are the beds of kelp
                        (Lessonia and Macrosystis) and macroalgae
                        (Gracillaria and Ulva). The combination of
                    the unique oceanographic conditions and coastal heterogeneity in the Chilean
                    coast has resulted in high levels of endemism (near 40%) in many
                    invertebrate groups [5], and several marine invertebrate taxa show latitudinal
                    biodiversity patterns, some of them explained by the presence of Antarctic fauna
                        [7]–[9]. Ecuador, Peru, and Chile are under the influence of
                    the Humboldt upwelling system and subject to high environmental variability
                    caused by the ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation) and LNSO (La
                    Niña Southern Oscillation), which cause important changes in community
                    composition and abundance, particularly of the plankton [1], [10]. The Atlantic coast of the South American continent is distinctly different from
                    the Pacific coast. It includes three major rivers (Orinoco, Amazon, and La
                    Plata), which discharge enormous amounts of freshwater and sediment to the
                    ocean, and the coast has an extensive continental platform. Argentina's
                    coast has mostly sandy beaches [6], [11] and some rocky formations
                    located mainly at Mar del Plata and at Peninsula Valdes. At Mar del Plata, these
                    rocky shores are dominated by two mussel species and by a diverse macroalgal
                    community with a clear tidal zonation [12], [13]. The Uruguayan coast is
                    dominated by sandy beaches with a narrow portion of rocky habitats known to
                    sustain a rich biological diversity [14]. Observed variations in
                    community composition and distribution may be related to the salinity gradient
                    caused by La Plata River discharge [15]. The coast of Brazil, extending almost 7,500 km, is under the influence of the
                    warm Brazil Current, the cold Malvinas/Falklands Current, and many rivers and
                    upwelling regions [16]. The warm northern coast, where the Amazon discharges
                    into the ocean, is characterized by a combination of freshwater, estuarine, and
                    marine ecosystems, with diverse but poorly known habitats [17]. The colder southern coast
                    is characterized by a variety of ecosystems, including mangrove forests,
                    seagrass beds, coral reefs, sandy beaches, rocky shores, lagoons, and estuaries.
                    Because of its vastness, extensive areas of Brazil's coast remain
                    unexplored. North of Brazil are Suriname, French Guiana, Guyana, and the
                    Venezuelan Atlantic Front. This area, including about 1,900 km of coastline, is
                    under the strong influence of the Amazon River. Therefore, the typical
                    ecosystems are estuaries, mudflats, sandy beaches, and mangrove forests, which
                    extend along most of the coastline [18]. The Venezuelan Atlantic
                    coast is also under the influence of the Orinoco River, with coastal mudflats
                    and extensive mangrove forests [19]. In this paper, we analyze the status of knowledge of marine biodiversity in five
                    subregions along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America. As most of
                    the information is based in national reports, these subregions were based in the
                    Large Marine Ecosystem boundaries as defined for South America, with a few
                    practical adaptations, based in country political borders. The paper also
                    provides an updated review of ecosystem threats, such as invasive species, and
                    the marine conservation strategies employed by South American countries with
                    access to the coast, excluding the Caribbean coasts of Venezuela and Colombia,
                    as these are included in another paper of this collection [20]. The first studies of the South American coastal biota were carried out during a
                    series of expeditions by European and North American researchers in the late
                    1700s and first half of the 1800s with naturalists Alejandro Malaspina, Roberto
                    A. Philippi, Alcyde d'Orbigny, Alexander Von Humboldt, Aimé
                    Bonpland, Charles Darwin, and Henry A. Pilsbry, among others [21], [22]. In the
                    late 1800s, several other important oceanographic expeditions, including the HMS
                        Challenger, collected samples along the coasts of Ecuador,
                    Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil [23]. In the 1900s, the Deutsche
                    Sudpolar Expeditions in 1901–03 [24], the Swedish Lund University
                    expedition to Chile in 1948–49 [24], the Royal Society Expedition
                    to Southern Chile [25], the Soviet Antarctic Expedition in 1955–58
                        [26],
                    and the Calypso campaigns in 1961–62 [27], [28] were among the most
                    significant European expeditions to South America. Other important
                    campaignsduring the second half of the twentieth century which increased the
                    knowledge of marine biodiversity and strengthened the local research capacities
                    were carried out by the R/V Academik Knipovich (1967), the R/V
                        Almirante Saldanha (1966), the R/V Atlantis
                        II, (1971), the R/V El Austral (1966–67),
                    the R/V Vema (1962), and the R/V Walther
                        Herwig (1966–71). At present, the oceanographic vessel
                        Polarstern from the Alfred Wegener Institute (Germany) has
                    been carrying out exploration voyages for more than 20 years to the southern
                    regions of the continent as well as Antarctica. In the northern latitudes of the continent, the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP)
                    Biogeographic Region has a rich history of oceanographic and biological
                    explorations dating back to the voyage of Charles Darwin to the Galapagos aboard
                    the HMS Beagle in 1835 and other scientific expeditions.
                    However, none of them visited the Pacific mainland shores and shelves of
                    Colombia and Ecuador. It was the Eastern Pacific Expedition of the U.S National
                    Museum of Natural History in 1904 aboard the U.S. Fish Commission steamer
                        Albatross that marked the beginning of systematic
                    oceanographic and biological studies in this region. The
                        Albatross sampled zooplankton and other biological material
                    in four shallow-water stations along the Colombian shore and nine deep-water
                    settings off the Panamanian, Colombian, and Ecuadorian coasts. Fish, mollusks,
                    and jellyfishes, among others, were collected and later described from these
                    localities [29],
                        [30],
                        [31]. A
                    series of research cruises and expeditions organized by North American
                    institutions in the first half of the twentieth century contributed greatly to
                    the knowledge of the marine fauna and flora existing in the rich area between
                    the low tide mark and 200 m of depth in the Panama Bight, including Panama,
                    Colombia, and Ecuador. The “Saint George” expedition visited Gorgona
                    Island in 1927 and collected relevant material of marine organisms, particularly
                    crustaceans [32]; the Allan Hancock cruises aboard the
                        Velero III and IV vessels, dating from 1931 to 1941 (see
                        [33]), and
                    the Askoy Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History in 1941 also
                    visited and collected material in Panamenian, Colombian, and Ecuadorian waters.
                    Many new species of fishes, mollusks, polychaetes, crustaceans, and other taxa
                    were described from material obtained from these cruises [34], [35]. A considerable number of
                    taxonomic and ecological studies have been carried out in the last three decades
                    in Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador. However, most of this work has
                    been geographically concentrated in a few localities such as the Gulf of Nicoya,
                    the Bay of Panama, the Pearl Islands, the Bay of Buenaventura, Gorgona Island,
                    and the Gulf of Guayaquil. Important collections or libraries of regional marine
                    fauna are maintained by the Los Angeles County Museum, the Scripps Institution
                    of Oceanography at La Jolla, California, the California Academy of Sciences in
                    San Francisco, and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama
                    City. In the Tropical Western Atlantic (TWA), the natural history of Guyana
                    (formerly British Guiana) was described by early explorers Sir Walter Raleigh
                    (circa 1600) and Charles Waterton (early 1800s), who reported his discoveries in
                    the book Waterton's Wanderings in South America, which
                    served as inspiration to British schoolboys like Charles Darwin and Alfred
                    Russell Wallace. In French Guiana, the first studies were carried out after
                    World War II, with fish inventories and later on, in the 1950s, with the benthic
                    (mostly shrimps) and demersal continental shelf fauna, from 15 to 100 m depth
                        [18]. The
                    Venezuelan Atlantic Front was until recently almost completely unexplored, and
                    the little information available concerned commercially valuable species of fish
                    and shrimp [19]. The local and regional academic community also had significant historic
                    representatives. Two pioneering figures were the Uruguayan-born (1788)
                    Dámaso Larrañaga in Uruguay and Argentina, who introduced the
                    Linnean binomial nomenclature in the continent, and the Argentinean-born (1896)
                    Irene Bernasconi, who studied the echinoderms. In the 1900s, research in coastal
                    biodiversity received a strong stimulus due to the immigration of many European
                    scientists before, during, and after World War II who contributed to knowledge
                    and capacity building mainly through their involvement in local universities and
                    natural science museums. Although a few research institutions were established
                    in the region early in the twentieth century, such as STRI in Panama (1923), the
                    most important stimulus to regional, autochthonous marine science was given by
                    the establishment of several marine research institutions, mostly in the 1950s
                    and 1960s. These institutions include the Instituto Oceanográfico de la
                    Universidad de Sao Paulo in Brazil (1946), the Montemar Institute of Marine
                    Biology (1941) founded by the Universidad de Chile and today part of the
                    Universidad de Valparaíso Faculty of Ocean Sciences, the Instituto de
                    Biología Marina de Mar del Plata in Argentina (1960, transformed to the
                    INIDEP in 1977), the Instituto Oceanográfico from the Universidad de
                    Oriente in Venezuela (∼1960), the Instituto del Mar del Perú
                    (∼1958), the Colombian Oceanographic Commission (1968), the Colombian
                    Science Foundation, Colciencias (1968), the departments of marine biology at
                    universities in Bogotá (1969) and Cali (1973), the Instituto de
                    Tecnología y Ciencias Marinas in Venezuela (1970), and the Oceanographic
                    Institute of the Ecuadorian Navy, Inocar (1972), and the Center for Marine
                    Science and Limnology of the University of Costa Rica (1979). These institutions
                    changed the way that marine science was done by incorporating into the
                    traditional taxonomic studies, time series of the environmental variables and
                    their effect on biodiversity. In the 1960s, the Food and Agriculture
                    Organization of the United Nations began to develop projects giving an impulse
                    to fisheries, especially in the southwest Pacific, an upwelling zone of
                    extraordinary productivity responsible for 20% of the world's
                    fisheries by the end of that decade. In the 1980s and 1990s, centers for marine
                    biodiversity research were created along the coasts of several countries,
                    especially Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. Argentina, developed several
                    institutions that depend on the national science council CONICET in the
                    Patagonian region (Puerto Madryn, Ushuaia, and Bahía Blanca), while in
                    Chile and Brazil, similar institutions are mostly dependent on universities
                    (e.g., Valdivia and Coquimbo in Chile and FURG, the Federal University of Rio
                    Grande, in Brazil). Access to oceanographic vessels, isolation between researchers, and the lack of
                    coordination between scientific programs have been an important limitation for
                    marine research in South America [36]. The countries with the best shipping capacities are
                    Brazil and Chile. The ships are mostly from a national navy or for fisheries
                    research, and in some instances, access to researchers from other institutions
                    is restricted. On the other hand, South America has benefited from regional
                    cooperation. One example is the establishment of a common fishing zone between
                    Uruguay and Argentina under the academic leadership of the Universidad de la
                    República in Montevideo and the DINARA (National Direction for Aquatic
                    Resources) in Uruguay, as well as the network of marine reserves (Red
                    Iberoamericana de Reservas Marinas). The natural history museums in South
                    America have been fundamental to preserving the regional marine biodiversity
                    patrimony both in collections and in literature and are considered to be
                    taxonomically indispensable. Some of the most relevant museums are the Museo de
                    La Plata and the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales (Argentina), the Museo de
                    Historia Natural (Quinta Normal) in Chile, the Museo Dámaso
                    Larrañaga and the Museo de Historia Natural in Uruguay, and the Museo de
                    Boa Vista (Brazil). Other collections are held either at research institutions
                    such as the STRI in Panama, the IMARPE in Peru, the INVEMAR in Colombia, or at
                    universities, such as the Universidad de San Marcos in Peru and the Universidad
                    Simón Bolívar in Venezuela. The activities of the Census of Marine Life (Census) program on the South
                    American continent began in October 2002 with the First South American Workshop
                    on Marine Biodiversity held at the University of Concepción in Chile. In
                    this workshop, most of the South American countries with access to the sea
                    reviewed the status of knowledge of their marine biodiversity (Venezuela, French
                    Guyana, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia). These
                    reviews were compiled as a special issue of the journal Gayana
                    in 2003. During this workshop, a regional South American Steering Committee
                    (SASC) was established with representatives from each of the above-mentioned
                    countries as well as representatives from OBIS, the Ocean Biogeographic
                    Information System established by the Census. The main goal of this committee
                    was to promote in a coordinated and well-organized way the implementation of
                    marine biodiversity research in the South American region under the umbrella of
                    the Census program, with particular emphasis on unexplored areas, and to
                    integrate the regional biodiversity databases into OBIS through the creation of
                    regional OBIS nodes located in Argentina, Brazil and Chile (http://www.iobis.org/obis/regional-nodes). Since 2002, the SASC
                    has held several workshops, and researchers in the South American region have
                    engaged in some of the Census projects: the Natural Geography in Shore Areas
                    (NaGISA), the Census of Antarctic Life (CAML), the Continental Margins
                    (COMARGE), the International Census of Marine Microbes (ICoMM), and the
                    Mid-Atlantic Ridge Ecosystem (MAR-ECO) projects. All of these projects have contributed significantly to increase the knowledge of
                    marine biodiversity in the region. In the nearshore, for example, the NaGISA
                    project has focused on the benthic diversity associated with rocky shores and on
                    seagrass communities by using a common protocol worldwide. In the Atlantic and
                    Pacific coasts of South America, four NaGISA sites were established at different
                    latitudes in Argentina (Puerto Madryn and Mar del Plata), Brazil (Paranagua
                    Bay), and Ecuador (Santa Elena). From these sites, preliminary data show that
                    macroalgae and bivalves are the most abundant groups in the intertidal rocky
                    shores of Argentina, while macroalgae, gastropods, and echinoderms are the most
                    abundant groups in the intertidal rocky shores of Ecuador. In the seagrasses of
                    Paranagua Bay in Brazil, polychaetes are the most abundant and diverse group
                        [37], [38]. In
                    the deep sea, on the other hand, the COMARGE project has studied the
                    biodiversity patterns along and across the Chilean margin through a complexity
                    of ecosystems such as methane seeps and oxygen minimum zones reporting that such
                    habitat heterogeneity may influence the biodiversity patterns of the local fauna
                        [39]–[41]. Furthermore, in these
                    soft reduced sediments below the oxygen minimum zone off the Chilean margin, a
                    diverse microbial community composed by a variety of large prokaryotes (mainly
                    large multi-cellular filamentous “mega bacteria” of the genera
                        Thioploca and Beggiatoa, and of
                    “macrobacteria” including a diversity of phenotypes), protists
                    (ciliates, flagellates, and foraminifers), as well as small metazoans (mostly
                    nematodes and polychaetes) has been found [42]. These authors argue that
                    the likely chemolithotrophic metabolism of most of these mega- and macrobacteria
                    offer an alternative explanation to fossil findings, in particular to those from
                    obvious non-littoral origins, suggesting that traditional hypotheses on the
                    cyanobacterial origin of some fossils may have to be revised. One of the major questions studied by the Census South American working groups on
                    continental margins and the Antarctic was how Antarctic isolation from other
                    continents by the Southern Ocean is relevant for understanding circulation
                    patterns in the world oceans and atmosphere, and how biological communities have
                    responded to past and present environmental changes. To answer this question,
                    about 50 researchers from South America and several countries in Europe as well
                    as the USA centralized their data in SCAR-MarBIN (Scientific Committee on
                    Antarctic Research Marine Biodiversity Information Network) within the framework
                    of the Antarctic-South America Interactions (ASAI) Workshop held in November
                    2009. This workshop provided an opportunity to exchange data and to compile an
                    integrated document on the potential Antarctic South American biodiversity
                    connections, taking into account all the marine realms. Results are to be
                    published in a special issue of the journal Oecologia
                    Australis. Another regional joint effort in the region is the Latin American and Caribbean
                    International Census of Marine Microbes (LACar-ICoMM) network launched in 2006
                    to evaluate the research capabilities and to identify complementary strengths
                    and possibilities for enhanced collaboration. Artigas et al. [43] summarized
                    some current studies on microbial diversity in both the Caribbean and South
                    American regions. LACar has also submitted a set of samples to the ICoMM
                    “454-tag sequencing” program in 2007, a metagenomics project
                    especially targeting Eubacteria and Archaea in a latitudinal gradient from the
                    southwest Atlantic (Patagonian littoral and shelf sediments and waters) to the
                    Caribbean (Puerto Rico sediment and bays), including large estuarine systems
                    (Río de la Plata and Amazon), and coastal brackish waters of Laguna de
                    Rocha and Guanabara Bay. Three other projects are under way dealing with the
                    giant bacteria of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) of the upwelling system in the
                    southeastern Pacific (Chile), the bacterial diversity at different depths of the
                    Cariaco Basin (Venezuela), and in French Guiana the bacterial diversity in the
                    fluid muds originating in the Amazon River. Although microbial metabolism and
                    productivity are at present being described in a variety of ecosystems in South
                    America and the Caribbean, only scarce information on microbial dynamics and
                    community composition is available for the planktonic and benthic realms of many
                    coastal and oceanic regions of the area. Such information is important to fully
                    understand topics such as biogeochemical processes and gradients in these
                    systems that are submitted to increasing pressure from human activities and
                    climate-change issues. The use of a wide range of available methods, techniques,
                    and protocols in molecular biology, electron microscopy, and in situ and remote
                    sensing facilities allow us to study all groups in a better and more systematic
                    way. All the data collected from the Census field projects in the South American
                    region as well as from museums, academic institutions, scientific literature,
                    and species databases, are being integrated in the South American regional nodes
                    of OBIS, which have contributed with nearly 300,000 records to OBIS from almost
                    7,000 species. This paper reviews and analyzes the marine biodiversity in five subregions of the
                    South American Pacific and Atlantic coasts. The areas considered here are based
                    in the Large Marine Ecosystem classification or LMEs (http://www.lme.noaa.gov/) which are defined as “areas of
                    the ocean characterized by distinct bathymetry, hydrology, productivity and
                    trophic interactions”, however with certain practical (political) border
                    considerations. The subregions as reviewed in this paper are: (1) the Tropical
                    East Pacific which includes the Pacific coasts of Colombia, Ecuador, Panama and
                    Costa Rica, and excluding the Galapagos Islands, (2) the Humboldt Current system
                    which includes Chile and Peru, (3) the Patagonian Shelf which includes Argentina
                    and Uruguay, (4) the Brazilian shelves which includes the north, south, and east
                    shelves of Brazil, and (5) the Tropical West Atlantic which includes the
                    Venezuelan Atlantic Front, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana (Figure 1). The paper also
                    assesses the research capacity in each of these five subregions as well as the
                    threats to biodiversity and the conservation initiatives to protect it.  [The Caribbean subregion (yellow) is subject of another article
                            within this collection [20]. Bathymetry

              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014631.g001 The total number of species was compiled from different sources depending on the
                subregion, and using the OBIS database as a point of departure. Species diversity in
                the area corresponding to the Tropical East Pacific region (see Sherman &
                Hempel, 2009) was reviewed and compiled from the literature and open-access
                databases and sources including local, country/territory, and regional checklists
                and inventories, (see Table S1 for information sources). Species
                diversity in the area corresponding to the Humboldt Current system (Chile and Peru)
                was reviewed and compiled from sources including OBIS and other electronic databases
                such as SeaLifeBase [44] and Algaebase [45]. For Cnidaria, the database
                linked to SeaLifeBase provided only species names, so the taxonomy was completed
                using the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) (http://data.gbif.org/welcome.htm). Other sources used were the
                database by Lee et al. [46], which provides information about free-living benthic
                marine fauna of Chile, and the species list in Castilla & Neill [47]. Species
                diversity in the area corresponding to the Patagonian Shelf (Argentina and Uruguay)
                was reviewed and compiled from OBIS through the Argentinean OBIS node AROBIS and
                from other electronic databases and sources. Data on vertebrate species were
                reviewed from publications as well as information available in OBIS (AROBIS node).
                These OBIS records combine published information from scientific papers and reports
                of pinnipeds, whales, and dolphins in the southwestern Atlantic and Magellanic
                region. Offshore records include reported sightings from scientific vessels and
                satellite tracking for seabirds, seals, and sea lions. These censuses include the
                distribution at or near shore waters of open coast, sheltered fjords, bays, and
                river mouths. Different records encompassing counting, sighting, and stranding
                programs, personal communications with trained individuals, photographs, unpublished
                abstracts from meetings, books newspaper articles, and specimen collections from
                academic institutions and museums (INIDEP-UNMdP) were also considered. The oldest
                records were accepted by the authors when the documentation and synonymy were
                reviewed. In addition, surveys made onboard fishing vessels provided additional
                biological information on targeted species and bycatch. Data on invertebrate taxa
                were obtained from the available literature, technical reports, databases, museum
                data collections, and the NaGISA project in the case of Golfo Nuevo rocky shore
                invertebrates. The only available, detailed and integrative compilation of reported
                marine invertebrate species was restricted to environments shallower than 50 m and
                was of limited geographical scope (Uruguayan shelf; [48]). There are no similar
                studies on the much larger and presumably more diverse Argentinean coast. It should
                be taken into account that the data presented here do not represent a revision of
                the identifications. Species must be evaluated through the material deposited in
                museum collections or by searching the species in the locality or area in which they
                were reported [48]. However, and although data presented must be verified by
                experts of each group, our results should reflect the current knowledge of marine
                invertebrate biodiversity in the area. Finally, data on algae, and the validity of
                seaweed taxa reported were checked with Algae Base [45] to update species names or
                higher taxonomic levels. Plankton were included in the different invertebrates
                groups (1,000 species were cited for Brazil and Argentina, [49]) (See Table S2 for a
                list of the main organizations in the Patagonian region that have contributed to
                knowledge of biodiversity on the regional scale and provided data sources for this
                revision). For the Brazilian shelf region, besides OBIS, the information was
                gathered with the assistance of several taxonomic specialists, and also taken from
                the available literature in both national and international journals, as well as
                many sources found in the gray literature (dissertations and theses) from major
                university libraries. Also, the National Council for the Development of Science and
                Technology (CNPq) Lattes Platform was accessed to assemble information based on
                Brazilian scientists' publications. Lattes Platform is a database where all
                Brazilian scientists are required to deposit their curriculum to gain funding for
                their research work. For the Tropical West Atlantic region, the data were compiled
                from OBIS and from a few literature sources. On the other hand, most information on
                threats and conservation was assembled from documents produced by the various
                national ministries of environment and from available scientific texts. Information regarding microorganisms such as bacteria and phytoplankton is provided
                for the overall continent and is not separated by subregions. The Tropical East Pacific (TEP) coastline is about 5,100 km long, extending from
                    the Nicaragua-Costa Rica border (11°04′34″N,
                    85°41′55″W) to the Ecuador–Peru border
                    (3°24′34″S, 80°18′25″W). According to Briggs
                        [50], this
                    area, including the corresponding 45,000 km2 of continental shelf,
                    belongs to the TEP Biogeographic Region, which encompasses the continental
                    shoreline and shelf that extends south of the lower end of the Gulf of
                    California along the continental coastline down to about Cabo Blanco near the
                    Ecuador–Peru border. It also includes several oceanic islands and
                    archipelagos, such as Galapagos, Malpelo, Cocos, and Clipperton [50]. More
                    specifically within the TEP, this subregion represents the southern half of the
                    Panamanian Province, which extends from the Gulf of Tehuantepec in Mexico
                    (22°N) to Cabo Blanco (4°S), Peru [50]. The boundaries and extent
                    of the Panamanian Province almost coincide with those of the Pacific
                    Central-American Coastal Large Marine Ecosystem [51]. According to the
                    bioregionalization scheme of the world's coasts and shelf areas [52], [53],
                    the Pacific coasts of Costa Rica and western Panama fall within the Nicoya
                    Ecoregion, whereas the eastern half of the Pacific coast of Panama, the
                    Colombian coast, and the northern half of the Ecuadorian mainland coast
                    correspond to the Panama Bight Ecoregion, and the southern Ecuadorian coast and
                    the northernmost Peruvian coast fall within the Guayaquil Ecoregion. These three
                    ecoregions are in any case part of the TEP [52]. The morphology of the coast throughout this region is highly variable and
                    heterogeneous, as are the features of the coastal masses. Much of the shoreline
                    includes high cliffs with alternating pocket beaches. This pattern dominates the
                    shorelines of northern and southern Costa Rica, central Panama, northern
                    Colombia, and norther Ecuador. By contrast, low coasts are made of ample
                    alluvial plains or deltas, backed by estuarine lagoons, tidal channels, and
                    extensive mangrove swamps on mudflats [53]–[57]. The Pacific coasts of Panama, Colombia, and northern Ecuador are covered mostly
                    by mangroves and dense rainforest vegetation. This is one of the wettest places
                    in the world, with local rainfall of more than 10,000 mm/year on the northern
                    Pacific coast of Colombia and very high river discharges. These conditions lead
                    to the largest concentration of estuarine systems with high freshwater outflows
                    of the South American Pacific, including the San Juan-Buenaventura,
                    Patía, Mira, Cayapas, and Gulf of Guayaquil estuaries. The predominant
                    dry climate in northern Costa Rica gradually changes toward the southeast to
                    rainy, humid conditions in eastern Panama-Colombia and then, to the south, again
                    to dryer climate in southern Ecuador and to arid conditions in northern Peru,
                    where less than 100 mm/year of rainfall is recorded [55], [58], [59]. Oceanic currents are rather complex in this region, with the North Equatorial
                    Counter Current entering from the Central Pacific and a branch of the Humboldt
                    Current, called the Colombia Current, coming in from the south. These currents
                    create a large anticlockwise gyre in the Panama Bight and generate the Panama
                    Current, which flows southwest toward the Galapagos (Figure 2). The northernmost coastal waters of
                    Costa Rica are seasonally influenced by an upwelling system at the Gulf of
                    Papagayo as well as the Gulf of Panama and adjacent areas, and the southern edge
                    of the Ecuadorian coast is affected by the huge upwelling system along the
                    shores of Peru [60]. The region is greatly affected by El Niño
                    events, which occur at about four- to nine-year intervals and widely change
                    climatic and oceanographic conditions (Figures 3 and 4). During El Niño the North
                    Equatorial Counter Current strengthens and widens, producing a surge of
                    relatively hot water from the central Pacific that hits the coast and
                    substantially reduces the influence of the upwelling systems [60], [61].  Bathymetry scale in meters.

              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014631.g004 The continental shelf is variably narrow in Costa Rica, western Panama and
                    northern Colombia (less than 20 km wide). The only places where the width
                    exceeds 100 km are off the gulfs of Panama and Guayaquil. Roughly one-third of
                    the coastline consists of stretches of mangroves on mudflats, with major
                    concentrations along the southern half of the Colombian and northern Ecuadorian
                    coast and in the gulfs of Guayaquil, San Miguel, Chiriquí, and Nicoya
                        [1], [55], [58]. There are
                    substantial stretches of rocky shores scattered throughout the coast; the
                    longest uninterrupted sections occur at the northwesternmost coast of Costa
                    Rica, along the Nicoya and Osa Peninsulas, at the northernmost edge of the
                    Colombian shoreline, and in the central coast of Ecuador. Long stretches of
                    sandy beaches are mostly concentrated along the Costa Rican, central Panamanian,
                    central Colombian and northern-central Ecuadorian shorelines [1], [56]–[58]. Coral reef development in
                    this region is limited by the regular impact of El Niño events and
                    unfavorable conditions that result from freshwater input from river runoff,
                    siltation, nutrient enrichment, and upwelling influences [62]. The overwhelming majority
                    of reef habitat in this region consists of rocky reefs. More suitable conditions
                    for coral development are found around islands and rocky promontories located
                    away from the mainland shoreline such as Isla del Caño (Costa Rica), Isla
                    Coiba, the Pearl Islands (Panama), Isla Gorgona (southwestern Colombia), Isla La
                    Plata, Isla Salango, and Bajo Montañita (central mainland coast of
                    Ecuador) [63]–[66]. At least 6,714 species-level taxa have been reported in the Pacific coastal
                        waters of Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador (Table 1, Table
                            S3), from four Protista groups, (Foraminifera, Radiolaria,
                        Tintinnida, Dinoflagelata), two plant phyla (algae, angiospermae), and 30
                        animal phyla. The quality of information was different for each of the taxa,
                        and no information was available on bacteria, fungi, Gastrotricha, and
                        Rotifera. This species number is constantly increasing, as new species are
                        described every year or are recorded for the first time in the region.
                        Knowing the taxonomic background (availability and expertise) of the region,
                        we did not expect to be able to produce species accounts of the same quality
                        for all the taxonomic groups. For most of the groups, the review can be
                        considered satisfactory, but several of these counts would greatly benefit
                        from further taxonomic review. At the phylum level, no species were reported
                        from five phyla, and this is probably because of a lack of taxomomic
                        attention rather than the absolute absence of these groups from the region,
                        which is highly unlikely. Not a single species of the phyla Placozoa,
                        Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, Loricifera, and Nematomorpha has been
                        recorded from the entire TEP region. The most diverse taxa in the region are
                        the Polychaeta (1,894 species), fishes (1,212 species), Crustacea (863
                        species), and Mollusca (875 species), which together account for
                        47.3% of the total known biota.  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014631.t001 A few of the species recorded from this region do not have resident
                        populations in the area or in the entire TPE, but are vagrant species that
                        reside in the Peruvian or Galapagos provinces. These include the Humboldt
                        penguin (Spheniscus humboldtii) and three species of
                        otariid pinnipeds that have been regularly recorded in Ecuador and southern
                        Colombia [67], [68]. In addition, under
                        certain anomalous oceanographic conditions (e.g., strong El Niño
                        events), the pelagic larvae of some Indo-West Pacific or Central Pacific
                        species seem able to cross the eastern Pacific zoogeographic barrier and can
                        succesfully settle in suitable places in the TEP. In this way the occasional
                        records of the Indo-West Pacific crown-of-thorns starfish
                            (Acanthaster planci) in Panamanian reefs [69] and the
                        Indo-West Pacific gastropods Mitra mitra and
                            Erosaria caputserpentis around Gorgona Island in
                        Colombia [70], [71] can be explained. Estimation of the number of endemic species could be accomplished with
                        relatively high confidence for only 21 of the 68 taxa groups (31%),
                        because information was simply not available for the remaining groups. The
                        total number of endemic species in the region for the 21 taxa is 122, which
                        represents only 2.18% of the species for these groups. The seemingly
                        low number of endemics in this region is a consequence of the widespread
                        distribution of the great majority of species beyond the Central-American
                        Coastal region. However, at a global scale, endemism in the TEP is among the
                        highest of any of the world's marine biogeographic regions [50]. For
                        example, of the nearly 1,300 species of fish recorded in the TEP, about
                        71% are endemic [72]. With the exception of mangroves, seagrasses, mammals, birds, and reptiles, we
                        can expect that the number of species recorded in this region will increase
                        in the future particularly for those groups scored 1–3 (least well
                        known) in the column “state of knowledge” in Table 1 and Table
                            S3. However, even for relatively well known groups such as
                        mollusks, echinoderms, and fishes, the inventories have by no means been
                        completed, and further discoveries ought to be expected. The marine biota of
                        the coastal waters in this region is far from being well known. Indeed, the
                        Colombian and Ecuadorian coastal waters have been recognized as the least
                        explored in the TEP region [1], [2], [66], [72]. The 6,700 species of marine taxa recorded at
                        present are clearly an underestimate. The lack of comprehensive regional
                        identification guides for most taxa is a major handicap to carrying out more
                        accurate species inventories, and most of those that are available need
                        thorough revisions. The OBIS database for the TEP region reports a total of
                        3,446 species, which is about 51% of the actual number of species
                        reported in this review (Table 2).  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014631.t002 A total of 19 alien species belonging to six of the 68 taxa groups were
                        registered (Table 1).
                        The most important introduced taxa in numbers of species are the Pisces (10
                        species). The absence of recorded introductions of more species from other
                        groups is indicative of the poor level of taxonomic knowledge for these
                        groups, rather than a lack of actual introductions. The Panama Canal has
                        provided opportunities for partial reconnection of the shallow-water faunas
                        of the TEP and the Caribbean since 1914, particularly by freshwater-tolerant
                        species. However, only two of the six Caribbean fishes that have entered the
                        TEP by this method, but only one or two species (a pipefish and the Western
                        Atlantic tarpon) seem to have successfully become resident populations there
                            [73]. In addition, for the majority of invertebrate
                        groups, there is often difficulty in deciding whether newly reported marine
                        species are introduced aliens, native species that had not been formerly
                        recorded, or cryptogenic species. Taxonomic expertise in the region provides limited coverage. For many groups,
                        the only currently active taxonomists work outside the region. Current local
                        expertise is completely absent or inadequate for many important taxa,
                        particularly those with small body sizes and little economic significance.
                        The taxa best covered by local expertise are Angiospermae, Aves, Reptilia,
                        Pisces, Algae, Echinodermata, and some groups of Cnidaria, Crustacea, and
                        Mollusca. Moreover, only a small fraction of the local experts are employed
                        as full-time systematists or taxonomists. For several groups, the coverage
                        of available guides and identification keys is relatively good (fishes,
                        turtles, birds, reef corals, mollusks, decapod crustaceans), although some
                        are outdated. For all the other groups, such guides are either inadequate or
                        completely lacking. An outstanding, collective effort for cataloging the
                        known marine biota of Costa Rica has recently been published [74]. Inevitably, given the limited number of active taxonomists in the region,
                        certain taxa (e.g., fish, mollusks, corals, and some crustacean groups) have
                        received far more attention than others, whereas many others have even been
                        completely neglected. Sampling effort has also been strongly biased toward
                        specific locations and habitats in coastal and shallow waters (mangroves,
                        sand beaches, coral and rocky reefs), with scarce collecting of demersal and
                        benthic organisms in waters deeper than 100 m. The major threats to marine biodiversity in this region are fisheries, global
                        climate change, habitat destruction or alteration, invasive species,
                        pollution, and human overpopulation along the coastal zone [1], [58]. The
                        eastern Panamanian and northern Colombian Pacific are in this sense not
                        severely affected, considering that human settlements in this area are
                        small. However, the marine ecosystems are moderately influenced by
                        terrestrial runoff, which has significantly increased in the last 20 years.
                        Reefs in this area also share some common threats such as bleaching, and the
                        live coral cover has decreased because of temperature increases of at least
                        1°C–2°C associated with the ENSO effect [75]. Other threats identified
                        in this region are fisheries and occasional oil spills from ships [58], [76].
                        Fisheries not only pose a threat to fish and benthic invertebrate species
                        such as shrimp, but have also proved to have detrimental effects on sea
                        turtles, particularly on the species Lepidochelys olivacea
                        and Chelonia agassizii, which are incidentally captured by
                        shrimp trawling nets [77]. There are 33 Marine Protected Areas, or MPAs, in
                        this region, including nature reserves, narional parks, and coastal wetlands
                        of international importance, 6 in Costa Rica, 19 in Panama, 5 in Colombia,
                        and 9 in Ecuador. The Humboldt Current Large region (HC) extends about 7,280 km along the west
                    coast of South America from northern Peru (3°24′34″S,
                    80°18′25″W) to the southern tip of Chile
                    (54°55′39″S, 64°52′12″W) [78], [79]. It has a surface area of
                    2.5 million square kilometers, containing 0.42% of the world's
                    seamounts and 24 major estuaries [79]. The HC is one of the
                    major upwelling systems of the world, with moderate to extremely high primary
                    productivity (150–300 gC/m2/yr, Figure 4) and highly productive fisheries
                    (e.g., in 1994, fish captures of Peru and Chile amounted to 12 million tons)
                    accounting for 16%–20% of global fish captures [79]–[81]. This current system is characterized by cold waters
                    that flow toward the equator, with offshore Ekman transport and coastal
                    upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich subsurface water (Figures 2 and 3). The current system is complex and marked
                    by coastal currents that can export waters up to 1,000 km offshore [79], [82] with
                    subsequent effects on biological populations of species with planktonic
                    dispersal [80].
                    While the northern part of the HC is affected by ENSO events, characterized by
                    influx of warm (e.g., temperature anomaly in northern Chile 2.5°C to
                    5.5°C; Sielfeld et al. 2002), nutrient-depleted equatorial waters and
                    consequent shifts in species composition [80], these events are of short
                    duration. In fact, over the last 25 years the overall tendency of the HC has
                    been slight cooling (−0.10°C SST; [83]). The HC has traditionally been divided into two principal biogeographic provinces:
                    the Peruvian Province north of 30°S, which is under subtropical influence,
                    and the Magellanic Province south of 41°S, which is under subantarctic
                    influence [25], [84]. Between these zones (30°–41°S)
                    researchers distinguish a transition zone [25], [85]–[87]. In a review of 27
                    biogeographic classifications proposed for the southeastern Pacific coast, Camus
                        [88]
                    identified three consistent spatial units: a Northern Area (north of 30°S)
                    containing a warm temperate biota (the Peruvian Province), a Southern Area
                    (41°–43°S to 56°S) with an austral biota (the Magellanic
                    Province), and an extensive Intermediate Area (30°S to
                    41°–43°S) lacking transitional elements and containing a mixed
                    biota without a distinguishing character. In spite of the numerous efforts made
                    to describe patterns on the Chilean coast ([89] and see reviews by Camus
                        [88];
                    Fernández et al. [90]; Thiel et al. [80]), there are few studies
                    focused on understanding the macroscale patterns of the HC, and no studies have
                    been conducted using an explicit two-dimensional spatial analysis of
                    biodiversity in this subregion. Historically, the lack of studies based on georeferenced data of marine
                    biodiversity was due to a lack of macroscale databases compiling this kind of
                    information. However, since 2002 the Ocean Biogeographic Information System
                    (OBIS) [91],
                        [92] has
                    begun to provide georeferenced data of marine biodiversity from all oceans, with
                    access through a Web portal (www.iobis.org). Analysis of the compiled data indicates three zones of high richness for this
                        region (Figure 5): (a)
                        the northern Peruvian coast between 5° and 8°S, with 501 species,
                        270 genera, and 193 families at the point of maximum diversity; (b) the
                        northern Chilean coast between 22° and 24°S, with 431 species, 273
                        genera, and 159 families at the point of maximum diversity; and (c) the
                        southern Chilean coast between 52° and 56°S, with 522 species, 324
                        genera, and 188 families at the point of maximum diversity. The richness
                        distribution was only consistent with the biogeographical limit between the
                        previously described Peruvian Province and Intermediate Area (30°S).
                        This limit is characterized by an area of low richness between 25° and
                        29°S. This pattern separates the Peruvian Province to the north, with
                        two areas of high richness (northern Peru and northern Chile), and the
                        Intermediate Area and Magellanic Province to the south, with one area of
                        high richness in the southern Magellanic Province (southern Chile).  Scale represents number of species. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014631.g005 The current diversity of the HC includes 10,201 species (Table 3, Table
                            S4). Amphipoda, Gastropoda, and Polychaeta are the taxa with the
                        greatest number of described species, while 18 taxa do not have reliable
                        taxonomic information (e.g., Oomycota, Loricifera). The best state of
                        taxonomic knowledge is for Mammalia, Aves, Reptilia, Pisces, Echinodermata,
                        and Mollusca. All of the other taxa had few, or very old, identification
                        guides and few experts currently working in the field until very recently,
                        when a comprehensive illustrated guide of marine benthic fauna of the
                        Chilean Patagonian fjords was published [93]. In this book, the
                        authors point out that the Chilean fjord region is one of the most diverse
                        in terms of marine fauna but also the least studied. This field guide
                        represents a 10 year unprecedented collective taxonomic effort in South
                        America in which nearly 50 specialists from 28 institutions and 14 countries
                        all over the world participated. The book provides identification keys for
                        nearly 500 species from 32 taxonomic groups within 13 phyla, and reports
                        more than 1800 species for this region.  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014631.t003 As for endemicity and alien species in the HC region, only Polychaeta, Aves,
                        and Mammalia have records of endemic species, while 31 taxa report
                        introduced species. Rhodophyta, Salmoniforme, and Polychaeta have the
                        greatest number of reported introduced species. The greatest number of
                        experts is concentrated in Mammalia, Aves, and Mollusca, while some highly
                        diverse groups have few taxonomic experts (e.g., Polychaeta) and other
                        groups lack taxonomic experts altogether (e.g., Nematoda, Rotifera). The
                        taxa with the greatest number of identification guides are Decapoda and
                        Amphipoda, while 49 taxa have only one (n = 23) or no
                        (n = 26) published identification guides. Of these
                        total number of described species for the HC, only 1.5% are used as
                        fishery resources, nine of them being commercial fish species which
                        constitute the greatest part of annual captures in the study area (i.e.,
                            Engraulis ringens, Sardinops sagax,
                            Trachurus murphyi, Strangomera
                            bentincki, Scomber japonicus,
                            Merluccius gayi gayi, Macruronus
                            magellanicus, Sarda chiliensis, and
                            Merluccius australis
                        [94]). The OBIS database for the HC region reports of
                        3,894 species, which is about 38% of the actual number reported in
                        this review (Table 2).
                        Despite the fact that the OBIS database for the HC needs to be completed
                        considering the existing knowledge of biodiversity in this region (Table 3 and S3), it
                        shows patterns consistent with previously described biogeographic limits and
                        with the potential processes (e.g., ENSO, OMZ, historical glacial events)
                        that could explain the observed differences in biodiversity between the
                        Peruvian and Magellanic provinces. An improvement of the OBIS database will
                        only be possible with an increase in the number of taxonomic experts to
                        cover underrepresented taxa, together with the widespread incorporation of
                        molecular approaches for species recognition. Nevertheless, OBIS has an
                        advantage over other available electronic datasets given that data are
                        georeferenced, which increases potential for the analysis of patterns and
                        underlying processes. The incorporation of revised taxonomic data, and the
                        investment in new coastal and oceanic expeditions will help to improve OBIS
                        with better georeferenced data which will allow us to reevaluate the HC
                        regional biodiversity patterns. Currently, the governments of Peru and Chile have made efforts to protect the
                        biodiversity contained in the HC through declared Coastal Marine Protected
                        Areas [95], [96]. In Chile there are 74 areas subject to some form
                        of marine conservation (22 officially protected areas and 52 proposals). The
                        currently protected areas in Chile cover over 30,000 km2 and
                        include five marine reserves, one marine park, six natural sanctuaries,
                        eight coastal marine protected areas, one biosphere reserve, and one RAMSAR
                        site. In Peru there are 14 marine and coastal protected areas comprising
                        over 3,000 km2, including six natural protected marine and
                        coastal areas, two natural sanctuaries, two national reserves, one wildlife
                        refuge, one reserved zone, and two areas of regional conservation. These
                        different designations translate into different degrees of protection, which
                        vary from regulated take (e.g. regulated fishing activities) to highly
                        restricted extraction [96]. In total, only about 1.4% of the HC is
                        currently under some degree of protection (this value is based on the most
                        current report of Coastal Marine Protected Areas of the Southeastern
                        Pacific, and increases the percentage reported by Heileman et al., [79] more
                        than twelvefold). In spite of these conservation efforts, Fernández
                        and Castilla [95] indicate that the apparently disparate goals for
                        conservation (i.e., exploitation of marine resources vs. preservation of
                        marine species) pose a challenge and constraint for the formation of a
                        network of marine protected areas. Threats to the biodiversity of the HC include contamination and
                        overexploitation of resources. However, while such activities can have
                        important impacts on marine biodiversity at the local scale, the wide
                        distibution of many species and their spatial structure as metapopulations
                        may protect the diversity of species' populations at the regional and
                        global scales, where these threats could cause local, but not global,
                        extinction. Furthermore, at the global level, species invasions have been
                        identified as an important cause of biodiversity decline [97].
                        Although there are few reports of highly invasive or aggressive
                        nonindigenous species in the HC [47], we believe that the
                        introduction of nonnative species represents a large risk to native
                        biodiversity. The rise in the aquaculture of exotic species (mostly
                        introduced salmonid species) and of international maritime transport in this
                        ecosystem, coupled with deficient taxonomic and biogeographical information
                        about native species, and the lack of explicit studies evaluating species
                        introductions in nonpristine areas such as ports and aquaculture centers,
                        leaves the door wide open for a potential disaster. In spite of this threat,
                        there have been few efforts to recognize and map endemic flora and fauna of
                        the HC and the biogeographical regions within this study area (Table 3). As mentioned
                        above, this deficiency makes it difficult to identify nonindigenous species.
                        A case in point is the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis in
                        Chile [47], which is a recognized invader around the world,
                        but because of the lack of taxonomic expertise and georeferenced data, the
                        date of introduction and current distribution in Chile is unknown. The
                        internationally recognized problem of nonindigenous species introductions
                        has recently been addressed in the HC where researchers and policymakers of
                        Chile and Peru have begun to try to generate practical solutions through
                        organizations such as Globallast and I3N-IABIN (Invasive Species Information
                        Network – Interamerican Biodiversity Information Network). The Patagonian Shelf (PS) extends for about 5,649 km along the Atlantic coast of
                    South America from northern Uruguay (33°51′21″S,
                    53°11′43″W) to the southern tip of Argentina, bordering with
                    Chile (54°55′39″S, 64°52′12″W). The area of the
                    Patagonian Shelf extends more than 3 million square kilometers in Uruguayan and
                    Argentinean territories and comprises coastal environments, the continental
                    shelf and slope, and ocean basins. Its continental shelf is generally up to 100
                    m in depth, and is the largest and one of the most productive ecosystems in the
                    Southern Hemisphere [98]. In the PS, two major marine currents coexists: the
                    cold Malvinas and the warm Brazil currents (Figure 2). The former originates in the
                    Antarctic circumpolar current and carries a high nutrient load north along the
                    Argentine coast. The nutrient-poor waters of the Brazil current meet the
                    Malvinas current as it moves southward along the edge of the slope [99], [100]. In the
                    confluence or transition zone (from 30° to 46°S), a series of
                    oceanographic phenomena (eddies, marine fronts, etc.) allow for high biological
                    production [101]
                        (Figures 3 and 4). Together, the coastline
                    extension of Uruguay and Argentina measures about 5,649 km of coastline [102]–[104] and span approximately
                    24° in latitude; consequently, the region exhibits large topographical
                    changes and climatic heterogeneity. Tidal regime is semidiurnal and the mean
                    tidal amplitude varies from 0.5 m in Uruguay to over 8.2 m in the southern
                    Argentinean Patagonia [105]. Air temperature changes seasonally in response to
                    variations in solar radiation, cloud cover, winds, and marine currents [100]. The
                    minimum and maximum air temperatures are −10.5°C and 39.4°C,
                    respectively, while maximum and minimum average ranges from 3.9°C to
                    20.9°C. Mean wind speed varies from 14.5 to 30.0 km/h [106]. The Río de la Plata estuary represents the greatest freshwater inflow to
                    the region, discharging on average 2.4×104 m3/s
                        [104], and
                    is one of the few geographical features (i.e., Valdés Península,
                    the Northpatagonic Gulfs, and the Magallanes Strait) that influence water
                    circulation at a regional scale [107]. Thus, the confluence of the Malvinas and Brazil
                    currents, together with the abundant terrestrial runoff of Río de la
                    Plata, and the relatively shallow waters of the area, combine to produce a
                    singular hydrographic system [53]. Biogeographically, the PS is divided into two zoogeographical provinces, the
                    Argentinian and the Magellanic, that join around Valdés Península.
                    The Argentine Biogeographic Province extends from 36° to 43°S,
                    encompassing coastal or relatively shallow shelf areas off Uruguay, and the
                    provinces of Buenos Aires, Río Negro, and Chubut in Argentina. The
                    Magellanic Biogeographic Province, extending from 43°to 56°S, includes
                    the coasts of southern Patagonia and the Malvinas/ Falkland Islands [108], as
                    well as deep waters in the outer Uruguayan shelf and slope [109] and in outer Buenos
                    Aires province. The coastal transition between both faunistic assemblages occurs
                    around 43°–44°S. On the continental shelf, it follows a
                    southwest–northeast direction around 70–100 m depth. In some benthic
                    taxa (e.g., Amphipods) only 15.3% of marine benthic species known to
                    Brazil have also been found in Argentina, suggesting that the Río de la
                    Plata estuary may act as a biogeographic barrier for many warm-temperate and
                    subtropical species. However, most Magellanic species that occur in southern
                    Chile extend to the southwest Atlantic [108], [110]. Total marine biodiversity of Argentina and Uruguay is 3,776 species,
                        invertebrates accounting for nearly 75% of total records. Mollusca
                        (22.5%), Crustacea (16.2%), and Pisces (14.3%) were the
                        most diverse taxa, and together with the echinoderms, cnidarians, and
                        macroalgae account for 65.3% of the total (Table 4 and S5).
                        The number of species listed in the OBIS database is nearly 3,200 (Table 2), meaning that
                        important efforts have been carried out in this region by incorporating data
                        into the georeferenced format of OBIS. For most taxonomic groups, species
                        records in this region need thorough revision, however, the estimated number
                        of taxonomists devoted to invertebrates in this region is low, and most are
                        focused on mollusks and crustaceans.  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014631.t004 Globally, 129 species of marine mammals have been described, and 44 of those
                        occur in the southwestern Atlantic. These include members of three families
                        of Misticeti (seven species of whales) and five families of Odontoceti (27
                        species). From 36 known species of pinnipeds, 10 were reported for the
                        Patagonian Shelf. Four breed in Uruguayan and Patagonian coasts, and six
                        species have frequent or occasional presence while migrating beyond
                        Antarctic waters. Sixteen percent of the marine mammals occurring in the
                        southwest Atlantic Ocean are endemic or limited in distribution (La Plata
                        River dolphin, Austral dolphin, and Commerson dolphin). Some are
                        representatives of distant populations in the Southern Hemisphere, such as
                        the Commerson dolphin observed in the mouth of rivers and bays in Patagonia.
                        The southern right whale breeds in waters of the north Patagonian gulfs, the
                        second most important reproductive area after South Africa in terms of
                        number of animals. Species with relatively small populations but high
                        aesthetic value, such as the killer whale, are also commonly observed in
                        Patagonia, with only some dozens of individuals. The most important
                        biodiversity of marine mammals has been recorded around Cabo Polonio in
                        Uruguay and from Río Negro Province to Beagle channel in Argentina.
                        In Río Negro the sea lions breed under the cliffs at Islote Lobos and
                        San Matías Gulf. Marine and coastal birds are relatively well known in the Patagonian Shelf
                        region, where there are 147 recorded species belonging to nine orders and 24
                        families. Seabirds comprise over 60 species, of which penguins represent the
                        largest biomass. This group includes 18 species that breed and feed in the
                        shelf waters, and the rest breed in other regions, such as Antarctica or New
                        Zealand, and use the area as feeding grounds [111]. The breeding
                        distribution of seabirds along the Patagonian coast of Argentina and the
                        Uruguayan coast is relatively well known, totaling close to 300 colonies of
                        between one and eight species each [112], [113].
                        Highest species diversity and abundance of breeding seabirds is found in
                        central and southern Patagonia (Chubut and Santa Cruz Provinces) and the
                        Malvinas/Falkland Islands [113], [114]. Less is known about their distribution at sea,
                        although surveys have been conducted in waters of the Malvinas/Falkland
                        Islands [115] and several studies have tracked seabirds during
                        their feeding and migration trips [116], [117].
                        The coasts of this region are also important feeding and resting sites for
                        close to 20 nearctic and Patagonian migratory shorebirds, and the migratory
                        patterns of some of them are well known. Little is known, however, about the
                        distribution and abundance patterns of the rest of the coastal bird species.
                        Twenty-five of the birds recorded in this PS are listed as threatened by
                        Birdlife International. Marine invertebrate groups from Argentina and Uruguay present great diversity
                        and have not been studied in their totality. For example, the molluscan
                        fauna (0–50 m) from Uruguay is composed of more than 380 marine and
                        estuarine species [21], [118]. In front of
                        Río de la Plata (Banco Inglés), 25 macroinvertebrate taxa were
                        registered, including 1 ophiurid, 1 bryozoan, 4 crustaceans, and 4
                        polychaetes, of which the mollusks are the dominant group: 15 species, 1
                        Polyplacophora, 8 Bivalvia, 6 Gastropoda (1 invasive), represented by 11
                        families and 11 genera [119]. Exposed sites on the rocky shores of the Cabo
                        Dos Bahias protected area (Chubut Province, Argentina), harbor a great
                        diversity of species [120]. In San Sebastián Bay (Tierra del Fuego)
                        113 macroinvertebrate benthic taxa were recorded, representing 12 phyla
                        typical of the Magellanic Biogeographic Province, [121]. In a study of the
                        macrozoobenthos of the Beagle Channel, 32,500 organisms from 34 taxa were
                        recorded; of which Bivalvia and Polychaeta were the most abundant, while
                        Asteroidea and Decapoda dominated in biomass [122]. A survey on the
                        amphipod biodiversity showed a total of 43 families, 118 genera, and 212
                        species registered in the Argentina and Magellanic biogeographic provinces
                        (including Malvinas Islands) from 36° to 56°S [108]. Some 15 species of
                        Volutid snails are endemic to the Atlantic Patagonian shelf and adjacent
                        areas [123]. The Burwood Bank (east of Isla de los Estados)
                        has great abundance and diversity of endemic species, including 22 species
                        of isopods and 12 species of bivalves [21], [118],
                            [123], [124]. Concerning regional flora, about 45% of the species occurring in the
                        Uruguayan coast represent a southern extension of the subtropical
                        distribution, and about 38% are a northern extension of the
                        warm-temperate flora with several cosmopolitan species. Therefore, typical
                        representatives of a tropical or temperate flora are equally absent in the
                        region [125]. More information is required to gain a better
                        understanding of seaweed diversity along the coast of the southwestern
                        Atlantic. At present there are few taxonomists in Argentina and in Uruguay.
                        To have good, reliable taxonomic information, it is necessary that young
                        researchers incorporating new techniques (including environmental genetics)
                        advance the exploration of poorly studied areas. Within the the Patagonian Shelf region, Sullivan and Bustamante [53]
                        ranked the Uruguay–Buenos Aires Shelf ecoregion high in biological
                        importance and need for conservation actions, because the area presents high
                        biological productivity, abundant populations of finfish, and numerous
                        marine mammals and seabirds that feed upon those fish. Intensive fisheries
                        in the Patagonian region are limited to a few species of fishes and
                        invertebrates, and 10 species (seven fish, one squid, one shrimp, and one
                        bivalve) represent 85% of the catch [98], [104], [126]. At least 15 species
                        that inhabit this region, mainly birds and mammals, provide some of the
                        greatest examples of marine fauna on the planet [117]. As top predators,
                        these species play key and varied roles in the marine ecosystem.
                        Albatrosses, petrels, penguins, sea lions, and elephant seals require large
                        areas and abundant food supplies for their survival. The International Union
                        for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has evaluated 223 species from the
                        Patagonian region, and of these, 65 species are actually endangered, 39 of
                        them fishes, 5 mammals, 16 birds, and 5 turtles [98]. In general, major threats to marine biodiversity include fisheries
                        overexploitation, habitat deterioration, and invasion of exotic species. The
                        most serious threats to vertebrates are overfishing, bycatch of seabirds,
                        marine mammals, and turtles, as well as degradation of coastal and marine
                        environments, urban pollution, and pollution from industrial activities such
                        as fishing and oil exploration, exploitation, and transport. Threats to
                        marine invertebrates biodiversity include degradation and disturbance of
                        environments, urban development in coastal areas, dredging, resuspension of
                        sediment, establishment and operation of ports, presence of exotic species,
                        tourist use, global and local aquatic contamination, fisheries targeting for
                        invertebrate species or bycatch resulting from dredging [123].
                        Activities carried out with bottom nets are also responsible for
                        modifications in the communities, which are generally slow to recover, even
                        after the activities stop. Bottom trawling dominates coastal and deep-sea
                        fishing and produces large amounts of discards of benthic invertebrates,
                        equivalent to 80% of the catch [127]. Bycatch affects
                        at least four species of marine turtles, some 20 species of birds, and seven
                        species of mammals (sea lions, elephant seals, and dolphins) as well as fish
                        and marine invertebrates. For example, an estimated 7,000 albatrosses and
                        petrels belonging to 12 species were killed as a result of interaction with
                        longline fishing vessels between 1999 and 2001. In the hake fishery, 37
                        species of fish, crustaceans, and mollusks (including the Argentine squid,
                            Illex argentinus) are caught and discarded. Between
                        35,900 and 42,000 tons of hake were caught in 2002 as bycatch in the trawl
                        fishery targeting the Argentine red shrimp, Pleoticus
                            muelleri
                        [126]. In
                        Uruguay, 55 species of macroinvertebrates were recorded in the fisheries of
                        the volutid Zidona dufresnei. The fishery targeting for the
                        scallops Psichrochlamys patagonica and Aequipecten
                            tehuelchus is the largest scallop fishery in the world, with
                        catches of more than 11,000 tons in 2006, exploiting banks with a total area
                        of 11,250 km2[127]. In recent years, a series of biological invasions including algae, mollusks,
                        hydroids, bryozoans, ascidiaceans, and crustaceans occurred in marine
                        environments because of involuntary transport or voluntary introduction,
                        always with severe consequences not only for the local biodiversity but also
                        from an economical perspective [123], [128]–[130]. This problem
                        constitutes a serious threat to biological diversity in the area. At least
                        41 non-native species have been recorded, especially invertebrates and algae
                            [128]. Undaria pinnatifida is a
                        successful invasive seaweed widespread along a large area of the coast of
                        Patagonia. Its presence is associated with a dramatic decrease in species
                        richness and diversity of native seaweeds. This impact should be considered
                        not only from a biodiversity point of view but also from an economic
                        perspective [131]. Undaria has been found
                        widespread in populations of the agar-producing red alga
                            Gracilaria and recently was reported settled on
                        shellfish commercial beds (M.L. Piriz, personal communication). Even when
                        native sea urchins feed on Undaria, they are unlikely to
                        play a role in the control of this kelp [132]. In Argentina, there are currently 45 coastal and marine protected areas aimed
                        at protecting marine or coastal resources [133], [134]. The
                        strong interest in coastal resources has resulted in the designation of
                        protected areas in which the extension of marine environments is in general
                        relatively small or simply lacking [134]. Thus, only 16 of these
                        protected areas include adjacent waters, while the rest protect exclusively
                        terrestrial environments on the coast. However, these coastal protected
                        areas include marine organisms, such as seabirds and marine mammals, among
                        their main conservation targets. Recent initiatives, led mainly by the
                        National Parks Administration of Argentina, are focusing on the designation
                        of new marine parks that include larger areas of marine waters. In the
                        Malvinas Islands, there are 17 natural reserves with significant coastal
                        habitat [98]. In Uruguay, there is an incipient process to implement the first Marine
                        Protected Areas. The newly developed National System of Protected Areas is
                        responsible for this process, and there are currently three coastal areas
                        considered (Santa Lucía, Cabo Polonio, and Cerro Verde). In addition,
                        there are proposals for a network of marine protected areas [104]. The
                        banning of hunting in the 1960s was the first national strategy for the
                        conservation of marine mammals in Argentina. Then, emblematic species such
                        as the southern right whale prompted specific protective initiatives such as
                        National Natural Monuments (Law 23.094/84). Uruguay (1998) also adopted the
                        protection and conservation of cetaceans and pinnipeds. Relevant actions for
                        conservation are aimed at the creation of more protected areas, development
                        management, and mitigation plans, including education and scientific
                        research. For benthic species, the most important feature requiring urgent
                        conservation is the habitat, which can be done by avoiding or minimizing the
                        effects of the dredging nets. Recently, ecosystem-based fishery management
                        and Marine Protected Areas are emerging as promising tools to conserve
                        marine environments, in view of declining fisheries indicators in the region
                            [104],
                            [135], [136]. In this sense, the Secretary of Environment and
                        Sustainable Development and the Federal Fishery Council of Argentina
                        recently (2009) banned “totally and permanently” fisheries
                        activities in the Burwood Bank (www.ambiente.gov.ar).
                        This zone presents high biodiversity and endemism, and the policy is in
                        agreement with the conservation of marine bottom environments in relation to
                        Argentine commitments with UN Food and Agriculture Organization. An
                        international, ecoregional conservation program will contribute to the
                        continuity of the ecological processes supporting the rich biodiversity of
                        this subregion. This will be critical to ensure ecosystem resilience and
                        adaptation to a changing environment, maintaining ecosystem processes and
                        sustainable use of marine resources. Brazil has the longest coastline in South America, extending 7,491 km on the
                    Atlantic coast of South America from Brazil's border with French Guiana in
                    the north at Cape Orange (4°20′20″S, 51°22′12″W)
                    to its southern border with Uruguay at Chuí (33°51′21″S,
                    53°11′43″W). Its territorial sea includes the 12 nautical miles
                    from the coastline, the maritime zone that begins in the coastal region,
                    including the marine continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone that
                    extends 200 nautical miles from the coast. Besides this area, Brazil has
                    successfully pleaded to the United Nations for an addition of 900 km2
                    where the continental shelf extends beyond the 200 nautical miles based on the
                    UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. This means that the Brazilian
                    jurisdictional waters now comprise 4.5 million km2 and have been
                    designated by the Interministerial Committee on the Sea Resources (CIRM, acronym
                    in Portuguese) as the “Blue Amazon.” The Brazilian continental shelf and margin are very heterogeneous. The shelf is
                    narrowest in the Northeast Region (8 km off Recife) and widest both off the
                    Amazon River in the north (∼300 km), and in the south off Rio Grande do Sul
                    (246 km). Apart from the Amazon, there are other important river outflows such
                    as the São Francisco in the Northeast Region, the Pardo, Doce, and
                    Jequitinhonha in the central part of the country, Paraíba do Sul, and the
                    combination of the La Plata and Patos Lagoon outflows in the South Region [137]. Also, the
                    continental shelf breaks at different depths depending on the region:
                    80–100 m in the North Region; 60–70 m in the Northeast and northern
                    Southeast regions from the Vitória-Trindade ridge to the north;
                    160–200 m in the southern part of the Southeast and South regions. Around
                    70% of the Brazilian exclusive economic zone defined between 12 and 200
                    miles off the coast is within the slope and abyssal zones. The slope is much
                    steeper in the Northeast and Southeast regions than in the North and South
                    regions and also comprises a variety of deep-sea canyons, cold corals, and cold
                    seeps. The western South Atlantic including its seamounts and topographic ridges has
                    been formed since the opening of the Atlantic Ocean around 110 million years
                    ago. The northern Brazilian margin has several major topographic highs that form
                    the North Brazilian Ridge and several scattered seamounts rising from the ocean
                    floor. These constrain the North Atlantic Deep Water flow, causing turbulence
                    and upwelling due to the seamounts topography [138]. Large erosional and
                    accretionary forces in the Amazon River mouth, caused by water boils,
                    crosscurrents, eddies, and tides, result in unstable channels and banks with few
                    stable points [139]–[141]. Fluid muds occur on the
                    inner shelf north of the river mouth. However, south of the Amazon mouth, the
                    lack of sediment influx has resulted in a complexly embayed erosional coastline
                        [142]. The
                    Amazon Fan area is stable tectonically, with subsidance rates of 5–20 cm
                    in a thousand years, but it is not quiescent. Numerous earthquakes within the
                    last 20 years have recorded magnitudes of 3.0 to 4.8 [163]. Besides earthquake
                    activity, near-surface faults and large methane gas deposits also create
                    unstable seabed conditions [143]. High-resolution seismic profiles near the shelf
                    edge show evidence of near-surface slumps and faulting 20–50 m in the
                    subsurface and concentrations (about 500 m2) of methane gas [143]. Several
                    studies (e.g., Amazon Shelf Study—AMASEDS, LEPLAC, REMAC, GLORIA, Ocean
                    Drilling Program—ODP) indicate that there is evidence for gas seepage on
                    the slope off the Amazon fan based on the incidence of bottom-simulating
                    reflections (BSRs), mud volcanoes, pock marks, gas in sediments, and deeper
                    hydrocarbon occurrences. The existence of methane at relatively shallow depths
                    and extensive areas of gas hydrates have been mapped in this region. Also, gas
                    chimneys have been reported, and exploratory wells have discovered subcommercial
                    gas accumulations and pock marks along fault planes. A sound geological and
                    geophysical understanding of the Foz do Amazonas Basin is already available and
                    used by the energy companies. A major oceanic plateau occurs off the eastern boundary of the Amazon cone: the
                    Ceara Rise. The Fernando de Noronha Ridge formed by a seamount ridge and
                    basement highs occurs at the western extremity of the Romanche Trench off the
                    Northeast Region of Brazil. Along this ridge, the Atol das Rocas is on the
                    western side of the flat top of a seamount, and oceanic basalt outcrops form the
                    Fernando de Noronha Island at the eastern extreme of this ridge. Basaltic rocks
                    are close to the surface at the Atol das Rocas, but only shallow-water
                    carbonates outcrop [144]. This is one of the first marine protected areas
                    created in Brazil because of the intense bird and turtle activities and also
                    rich marine life [144]. Many other seamounts, such as the Pernambuco and
                    Bahia seamounts, occur along fracture zone lines farther south. The Victoria-Trindade Ridge comprises seamounts arising from the Brazilian
                    continental margin toward the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, with volcanic rock
                    outcroppings at Trindade and Martin Vaz oceanic islands at the eastern extremity
                    of this chain, about 1,050 km from the continent. Between the continental margin
                    and Trindade, the other seamounts on this ridge rise from around 5,000 m in the
                    southwest Atlantic abyssal plain, but have fairly shallow summits at depths of
                    34–76 m. Along the eastern Brazilian continental margin, several plateaus
                    can be found, but the major ones are the Abrolhos Bank and Pernambuco Plateau,
                    and smaller ones such as João Pessoa and Rio Grande do Norte
                    Plateaus. The large Sao Paulo Plateau is in the southern region off Brazil, and its
                    southern edge is formed by a sharp volcanic ridge with more than 2,000 m relief
                    and with several seamounts at its eastern boundary [145]. According to these
                    authors, a broad aseismic ridge occurs to the southeast of the São Paulo
                    plateau. These topographic features also form a major barrier to the Antarctic
                    Atlantic Bottom Water (AABW), which flows northward through the Vema channel
                        [146],
                        [147].
                    According to Campos et al. [138], major upwelling and turbulent submarine flows are
                    likely to occur on the flanks of these topographic highs, and the occurrence of
                    cobalt crusts and manganese nodules can be expected in the abyssal areas. The climate of the Brazilian coast generally depends on the South Atlantic
                    tropical and polar anticyclones, the latter with its cold air mass originating
                    in southern Argentina [148], or in the Weddell Sea in the Antarctic region
                    (Aquino personal communication). Over the last few centuries, the wind regime
                    oscillation has been the major factor causing water temperature variability
                        [149].
                    This also greatly influences the displacement of water masses and the occurrence
                    of eddies and upwellings of seawater in the subantarctic (South Atlantic Central
                    Water) especially in the Southeast and South regions of Brazil [148]. Meridional temperature gradients characterize the South Atlantic, where the sea
                    surface temperature increases with latitude and decreases toward the southern
                    region [150]. Warmer temperatures from the South Equatorial
                    Current dominate the margin north of the Vitória-Trindade Ridge at the
                    north-northeastern border where they meet cooler waters from the North
                    Equatorial Current. South of the Vitória-Trindade Ridge, water masses are
                    more stratified as the southward flow of the Brazil Current encounters the
                    subtropical gyre south of Rio de Janeiro [151]. Each year, during the
                    first semester, five water masses are dominant at 20°S: (1) the Tropical
                    Water (TW) from surface to 200 m (22°C–27°C and salinity
                    36.5–37); (2) the SACW from 200 to 660 m (6°C–18.5°C and
                    salinity 34.5–36.4); (3) the Antarctic Intermediate Waters (AIW) from 700
                    to 1,200 (4°C–10°C and salinity 34.2–34.8); (4) the North
                    Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) from 1,200 to 2,000 m (3°C–4°C and
                    salinity 34.6–35); and (5) the Atlantic Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) at
                    abyssal depths (0.5°C and salinity 34.60) [151]–[154] (Figure 3). The Brazilian continental margin is strongly influenced by the western contour
                    currents. There are two major contour currents detected at the surface: the
                    Brazil Current (BC) flowing southward and the Brazilian Northern Current (BNC)
                    flowing northward [137]. The BC, which is shallowest between 15° and
                    20°S, transports saline, oligotrophic tropical waters, and as it reaches the
                    Vitória-Trindade Ridge, it receives additional contribution from the
                    South Atlantic Central Waters (SACW), reaching a vertical extension of about 500
                    m, and continues to flow southward toward the Subtropical Convergence
                    (33°–38°S) where it merges with the Malvinas Current and then
                    flows away from the coast to the east [155] (Figure 2). The BC changes direction near Cabo Frio in the state of Rio de Janeiro as a
                    wind-driven process following the continental margin to the southwest and
                    causing eddies throughout the year [156]. This process promotes
                    the upwelling of the SACW, which is rich in nutrients [157], [158],
                    enhancing fisheries biodiversity and biomass in the region [159]. The BC increases in
                    volume as it reaches the south of Cape Santa Marta Grande because of the
                    intermediate portion of the subtropical gyre circulation (500–1,200 m).
                    The AIW is transported at this depth range, and the BC becomes more than 1,000 m
                    thick as it flows through the South American Atlantic southern continental
                    margin [160]. The AIW receives the Intermediate Contour Current (ICC)
                    at intermediate levels around 28°S. The ICC flows northward, contours the
                    Vitória-Trindade Ridge, and receives a contribution at the level of the
                    Southern Equatorial Current branch at 19°S, forming the Brazilian Northern
                    Subcurrent (BNS). This transports the SACW and AIW toward the equator, and it
                    strengthens toward the northern part of Cape Branco in Paraíba as a
                    result of its fusion with the BNC and equatorial branches of the South
                    Equatorial Current [161]. This allows the BNC to cross the equator moving
                    away from South America at 10°N. According to Vink et al. [161], the
                    Brazilian North and Northeast regions are strongly influenced by the BNC. The BNC reaches speeds of 1–2 m/s, forcing the Amazon River water and
                    sediments to the northwest. The Amazon shelf in itself is a dynamic region, and
                    dominated by the effluent of the Amazon River, which has a mean annual transport
                    of approximately 1.8×105 m3/s of freshwater flowing
                    into the Atlantic Ocean [162] and depositing a daily average of 3 million tons of
                    sediment near its mouth [142], [163]. The annual outflow from the river accounts for
                    20% of all the freshwater that drains into the oceans of the world [164]. Waters
                    from the Amazon River can migrate as far north as Barbados and as far as 320 km
                    offshore. The South Atlantic is possibly a major corridor to the deep Atlantic oceanic
                    circulation with the northward flow of the AABW, which originates especially in
                    the Weddell Sea, and the southward flow of the NADW above it [152]. The
                    latter greatly contributes to the circulation toward the east and upwells at the
                    Antarctic Divergence at 60°S. The circulation of water masses, especially
                    the deep-water circulation, is greatly influenced by all topographic features
                    along the Brazilian continental margin and the presence of adjacent seamounts.
                    The southwest Atlantic thermocline is well marked with its upper limit between
                    50 and 100 m, but its depth varies depending on latitude and season, being
                    deeper in the winter at highest latitudes. Near the seamounts with shallow
                    summits (e.g., those at the Vitória-Trindade Ridge or at the North
                    Brazilian Ridge), local turbulence because of the upwelling effects disturbs the
                    thermocline [150, and authors therein]. Considering the heterogeneity of the Brazilian continental shelf, margin,
                    adjacent seamounts, and abyssal plain, the very large Brazilian marine ecosystem
                        [165]–[168] is hydrologically and
                    topographically complex. In fact, it has contrasting dominant ecosystems of
                    unique features, including mangroves, coral reefs, dunes, sand banks, sandy
                    beaches, rocky shores, lagoons, estuaries, and salt marshes, all of which host
                    an uncountable number of flora and fauna species with high levels of endemism.
                    Some species are in danger of extinction, while others are detected as being
                    invasive. Despite its low productivity (less than 150 gC/m2/y, based
                    on SeaWiFS global primary productivity estimates) (Figure 4), this whole “Blue
                    Amazon” has a high marine biodiversity [167], and its deep seas
                    include a variety of ecosystems such as canyons, gregarious kelp, coralline and
                    sponge systems, pock marks, seamounts, and abyssal plains with manganese nodules
                    and other mineral resources [138], [169]–[174]. A total of 9,103 species have been reported in Brazilian waters (Tables 5 and S6).
                        The most diverse taxa in the region's marine coastal waters are the
                        crustaceans (1,966 species), followed by the mollusks (1,833 species), the
                        fishes (1,294), and the polychaetes (987 species), which together account
                        for 66.79% of the total known biota. While most of the available
                        information on marine biodiversity is about the continental shelf, Brazil
                        also has a number of significant publications on the slope, the seamounts
                        and oceanic islands, and the abyssal plains (Table
                            S7). These publications derive from many cruises along the
                        Brazilian coast, deeper stations mainly at the southeast offshore, but also
                        deep-sea fishing in the North and Northeast regions (Table
                            S8). Most of the deep-sea research has been relatively recent
                        (since 1986) and focused on fish, macrobenthic invertebrates, and
                        zooplankton, while the best-studied areas have been the Campos Basin, the
                        North Brazilian Ridge, Fernando de Noronha, and Vitória-Trindade
                        Ridge. As for the continental shelf, most of the knowledge on marine
                        biodiversity has been gathered from the north of Brazil, part of the
                        northeastern coast, and those from the southern regions derive from the
                        continental shelf shallow waters. The Brazilian continental shelf, like most
                        shelves around the world, is subject to growing pressure from human
                        activities and holds the majority of fisheries resources [175].
                        There are several articles on the taxonomy, phylogeny, biogeography,
                        biology, and ecology of many marine organisms, and also community data
                        available from major national programs such as the REVIZEE (Assessment of
                        the Sustainable Potential of Living Resources of the Brazilian Exclusive
                        Economic Zone), which encompassed the whole of the Brazilian coast. Some
                        examples are provided in Table S8. Also, many studies are regional
                        and include several topics from taxonomy to marine communities, oceanography
                        studies, and conservation. An example of a comprehensive study is the OPISS
                        (Oceanografia da Plataforma Interna de Sao Sebastiao), which was carried out
                        at the Sao Sebastiao Continental Shelf on the northern coast of Sao Paulo
                        State [175]. This region is subject to a complex
                        hydrological regime with physiographic features determined by its proximity
                        to the Serra do Mar (mountains dominated by Atlantic Forest), the presence
                        of Sao Sebastiao Island, and the development of one of the most important
                        oil and gas terminals in Brazil [175]. Other fairly well
                        studied areas are the Guanabara Bay in Rio de Janeiro State [176]–[188]; Ubatuba [189]–[192], Cananéia in
                        São Paulo State [193], [194]; and Paranagua Bay in
                        Parana State [195]–[201].  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014631.t005 Collections of marine organisms exist at several important institutions
                        throughout Brazil, such as Museu Emilio Goeldi (North Region); LABOMar (a
                        marine laboratory at the Universidade Federal do Ceará), Universidade
                        Federal de Pernambuco and Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco,
                        Universidade de Mossoró (Paraíba), all in the Northeast
                        Region; Museu Nacional and Instituto de Biologia at the Universidade Federal
                        do Rio de Janeiro; Museu de Zoologia, Departamento de Ecologia Geral
                        (Instituto de Biociências), Instituto Oceanográfico at the
                        Universidade de São Paulo, SP, and Museu de Zoologia da Universidade
                        Estadual de Campinas “Adão Jose Cardoso” (Southeast
                        Region); Departamento de Zoologia at the Universidade Federal do
                        Paraná, and the Museu Oceanográfico (Fundação
                        Universidade do Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul) in the South Region. Also,
                        several species lists and illustrated guides and manuals have been produced
                        recently including reviews on the biodiversity of the ecosystems in the
                        continental shelf [202]–[221]. According to the REVIZEE program, the Brazilian continental shelf and slope
                        (down to 2,076 m depth) have been divided into four sectors called
                        “scores”: North, Northeast, Central, and South. In each of these
                        scores, extensive surveys have been carried out to estimate the diversity
                        and abundance of planktonic, nectonic and benthic organisms and their
                        sustainable exploitation potential [212], [215], [222], [223]. In the Brazilian North score, the freshwater from the Amazon River, rich in
                        nutrients, is responsible for the highest primary production in the country
                        (more than 300 gC/m2/yr, based on SeaWiFS global primary
                        productivity estimates) [168], [167]. Most of what is
                        known about marine biodiversity in the north is related to fishing, mangrove
                        habitats, and data obtained through the REVIZEE program. About 30% of
                        Brazilian fishing takes place in the North Region, where Pará is the
                        country's second-largest landing port [224]–[226].
                        Harvested species include catfish, corvina, sawfish, red porgy, lobsters,
                        and prawns. The region includes one of the main shrimp banks in the world,
                        extending from Tutóia in Maranhão to Orinoco in the Guiana,
                        mainly because of its extensive mangrove areas [227], [228]. The mangroves sustain
                        high biodiversity of estuarine and marine organisms and represent important
                        nurseries for many species of fish, feeding grounds for some marine mammals
                        such as the manitees, and a nesting place for many species of seabirds [229],
                            [203]. The Northeast score accounts for about 12% of the national fishing
                        (about 70,000 tons per year) and this fishing can be divided into two
                        groups: coastal fishing mainly on the continental shelf, and fishing near
                        islands and oceanic banks [230]–[235]. The oceanic fishing is
                        dedicated to tunas [169], [236]–[243]. Dog
                        snaper, dentex, sawfish, red porgy, flying fish, mackerel, and dorado are
                        among the most important fish landed by artisanal fisherman in the region
                            [230]. Shrimps, prawns, and lobsters are captured in
                        trawling nets and are exploited to the sustainable limit [178], [244]–[246]. Panulirus
                            argus, P. laevicauda, P.
                            echinatus, Syllarides brasiliensis, and
                            S. delfosi are economically important, but only the
                        first two have fishing restrictions. Crustaceans and mollusks are considered
                        important resources in the Northeast Region. According to Alves and Nishida
                            [247],
                        the crab Ucides cordatus (Linnaeus, 1763) or
                        “caranguejo-uçá,” as it is known in Brazil, is one
                        of the most conspicuous and abundant components of the Brazilian mangrove
                        ecosystems epibenthic macrofauna, and the most exploited resource by
                        artisanal fisheries, especially in the Northeast Region. The scientific
                        interest in other marine organisms, which inhabit different ecosystems in
                        the region, is supported by local federal universities and research
                        centers. The Central score is characterized by the presence of coral reefs and
                        calcareous algae. The Abrolhos Bank on the southern coast of Bahia State is
                        the largest coral bank in the South Atlantic (70,000 km2) with
                        more than 16 stony corals recorded [248]. Edged by Atlantic
                        forest, the bank comprises a mosaic of coastal marine environments,
                        including coral reefs, algae bottoms, mangroves, beaches, and sand banks
                            [170],
                            [249],
                            [250]. The highest biodiversity in the South Atlantic
                        is found in this area; Abrolhos shelters not only many endemic species such
                        as the brain coral, but also crustaceans, mollusks, sea turtles, and marine
                        mammals (especially cetaceans) [251]–[253].
                        Nonarticulated calcareous algae found in this region attach to various
                        substrates. As this region is generally oligotrophic and has different water
                        masses including that of the Atlantic Central Waters, which are coldest and
                        rich in nutrients, a rich diversity of macroalgae benefit from these
                        hydrological conditions. These macroalgae include mainly the tropical orders
                        Cladophorales, Bryopsidales, Dyctiotales, Fucales, and Ceramiales, among
                        others [254], which are also usually found in the Caribbean
                        Sea [255]. Conversely, many species with temperate affinities
                        and found only in areas under the influence of the subantarctic-originated
                        Atlantic Central Waters, such as the kelp Laminaria
                            abyssalis
                        [256], the
                        geographic distribution of which extends from the northern part of Cabo Frio
                        in Rio de Janeiro State to the mouth of Rio Doce River in Espírito
                        Santo State [257], [Yoneshigue-Valentin personal
                        observation]. The region is also characterized by endemic species of
                        the kelp Laminaria abyssalis and the agariferous
                            Gracilaria abyssalis and is abundant in economically
                        important rhodolites formed by calcareous algae. About 774 infrageneric taxa
                        of marine macroalgae (482 Rodophyta, 191 Chlorophyta, 101 Heterokontophyta)
                        are so far known for the whole Brazilian coast. Regarding fisheries,
                        Serraniids, groupers, and other species of fish that live in reefs and rock
                        bottoms, and also pelagic fish are often caught in the shores of southern
                        Bahia and also Espírito Santo State. Cabo Frio, Niterói, and
                        Angra dos Reis in Rio de Janeiro State are other important landing ports in
                        the Central score. The artisanal fishing is significant for prawns, corvine,
                        mullet, and cutlass in certain areas such as the Guanabara Bay, Sepetiba
                        Bay, Ilha Grande, and Parati in Rio de Janeiro State. About 185 species of fish have been identified from the Southern score. There
                        are many landing ports (Rio Grande, Itajaí and Navegantes, Santos and
                        Guarujá) in the South Region, and fishing control is harder in this
                        region. In contrast to the Northeast Region, artisanal fishing in the South
                        represents only about 15% of the regional production [258],
                            [259]. But artisanal fishing with bottom trawling is
                        common in São Paulo, Paraná, and Santa Catarina states, where
                        the main fishing targets are prawns, corvinas, hakes, soles, engrauliids,
                        and mullet [260], [261]. Prawns and crabs are
                        heavily fished in Patos Lagoon in Rio Grande do Sul State, and at its
                        coastline the fishing industry aims at corvinas, hake, anchovies, sardines,
                        shark, skate, and dogfish, among others [258]. There are several
                        important field guides and manuals related not only to pelagic organisms but
                        also to benthic ones (e.g., sponges [262], [263], [264], polychaetes [265], [266]). Over the years, the vast extent of the coastline and the variety of coastal
                        marine ecosystems in Brazil gave rise to the public perception of
                        inexhaustible sea resources. This perception led to policies that encouraged
                        unsustainable use of resources. As a result, although marine fisheries
                        contribute 63% of the total fish production in Brazil, over
                        80% of the resources are currently overexploited [267], [268]. On the
                        other hand, the fishing industry in Brazil is responsible for generating
                        approximately 800,000 jobs, apart from providing animal protein for human
                        consumption. This means the fishing industry has enormous social and
                        economic importance affecting some 4 million people who depend directly or
                        indirectly on this sector [269]. Brazilian legislation defines the coastal zone
                        as a national patrimony that includes also the 12 nautical miles of
                        territorial sea. Coastal management is conducted by a national plan legally
                        enforced, complemented by state and county plans, and by coastal
                        ecologic-economic zoning limited to small portions of the coastal zone [270].
                        However, only a small portion of the enormous Brazilian coastline is under
                        some form of protection or management, and there are large areas under
                        anthropogenic pressures [271]. Considering the high levels of endemism of
                        Brazilian marine organisms, and the likelihood that the growing population
                        will exert even higher anthropogenic pressures such as fishing, large-scale
                        conservation and management plans are urgently needed. Some efforts have
                        been undertaken with management from different societal sectors and with
                        background information provided by the scientific community [272]–[274]. Considering all the factors mentioned above, Brazil faces the difficult tasks
                        of identifying, inventorying, and scientifically studying all its biological
                        diversity (terrestrial and marine), as well as developing and implementing
                        management and sustainable use mechanisms [267], [268]. The government's
                        primary formal mechanism for guaranteeing the conservation of Brazilian
                        biodiversity is the Convention on Biological Diversity. This convention was
                        adopted and approved during the United Nations Conference on Environment and
                        Development, held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. As a prime mover in these
                        negotiations, Brazil was the first signatory of the convention, and on
                        December 29, 1994, the Brazilian Federal Government established the National
                        Programme of Biological Diversity (PRONABIO) [267], [268]. This program has been
                        modified since that time to coordinate implementation of Brazil's
                        commitments to the convention, and the Brazilian Ministry of Environment has
                        played a key role in this process, which includes the formulation of the
                        National Biodiversity Policy (Política Nacional de Biodiversidade,
                        PNB). The PNB was prepared in consultation with the federal and states'
                        governmental officials, nongovernmental organizations, scientific,
                        indigenous and local communities, and entrepeneurs. As part of this process,
                        the ministry has coordinated a series of baseline studies, such as an
                        evaluation of the adequacy of the Brazilian legislation in relation to the
                        Convention on Biological Diversity, a state-of-the-art synthesis of the
                        knowledge of the Brazilian biodiversity, a comparative analysis of national
                        biodiversity strategies from 46 countries, and a synthesis of records of
                        traditional knowledge associated with biodiversity [275]. Also, parallel
                        to the national consultancy, the ministry has promoted a general evaluation
                        of seven major biomes in Brazil, including that on the coastal zone and
                        marine environment [267], [268]. Currently, despite existing policies, there is
                        an intensification of conflict between small-scale and industrial fishermen,
                        shrimp farming and mangrove crab harvesting, resorts installation and native
                        communities, NGOs and activities of oil and gas companies, and between
                        federal and state governmental agencies in Brazil over environmental permits
                            [270]. The major challenge for PRONABIO has been to
                        demonstrate the direct benefits of conserving biodiversity and to promote
                        the public action required to increase and guarantee the sustainable use of
                        biodiversity. Even though Brazil has implemented conservation practices in coastal and
                        maritime zones (Marine Protected Areas, Marine Reserves, and Marine National
                        Parks), these efforts represent less than 0.4% of the total area
                        within the territorial sea and EEZ (Figure 6) [269]. Several initiatives
                        have been put in place to change the way people think. These initiatives
                        include teaching the concept of conservation units through the demonstration
                        of case studies, implementation of participative shared management of
                        resources, capacity building aimed at technicians and managers, and outreach
                        to decision makers [276]. Some of these coastal and marine conservation
                        units have been set in the northern coast of Paraná and south of
                        São Paulo, as well as in the south of Bahía, Rio de Janeiro,
                        and Santa Catarina [276]. Today Brazil has 16 Marine Protected Areas
                        mostly over coral reef ecosystems, including three recognized by
                        international acts (RAMSAR and Natural World Heritage sites) [276].  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014631.g006 Shallow-water reefs (those occurring on the continental shelf), are an
                        important physiographic feature of the coast of Brazil and occur along at
                        least one-third of the coastline (about 3,000 km, from Maranhão to
                        south of Bahia). Coral reefs prevail northward (0°52′N to
                        19°S) and rocky reefs southward (20° to 28°S) [170], [248], [277],
                            [278].
                        These extensive areas encompass diverse reef fish and invertebrate
                        communities, in many places overexploited, where only recently have studies
                        related to the impacts of fisheries on these ecosystems provided the basis
                        for implementing management and conservation actions ([276]–[280] and
                        authors therein). Around 18 million people depend directly or indirectly on
                        reef ecosystems in Brazil [249]. As coral reefs are recognized as areas within
                        the Convention, several actions with regard to these environments have been
                        motivated in Brazil. The “Atlas dos Recifes de Coral nas Unidades de
                        Conservação Brasileiras” (Atlas of the Coral Reefs
                        within the Brazilian Conservation Units) published in 2003 was the first
                        initiative to map the corals in the South Atlantic, not included in world
                        maps before. There is a campaign for the Conscious Conduct in Reef
                        Environments, outreach activity on conservation aimed at tourists. A
                        monitoring program of Brazilian coral reefs (Reef Check Brazil, http://reefcheck.org) aims to establish the baselines for
                        the conservation units national monitoring program that protect these
                        ecosystems (this has now more than five years of sampling data). The
                        Ministry has established partnerships with projects such as the Coral Vivo
                        Project (Live Coral, www.coralvivo.org.br) in which several techniques for coral
                        reproduction have been used, besides the country's enrollment in the
                        International Coral Reef Initiative. Other projects associated with reefs
                        are worth mentioning. The Institute Chico Mendes of Biodiversity
                        Conservation (ICMBio – http://www.icmbio.gov.br), an organization responsible for
                        conservation and management of threatened species in Brazil, is leading a
                        national initiative to assess the status of conservation of species,
                        including coral reef species, in partnership with IUCN and the Global Marine
                        Species Assessment. The Goliath Grouper Project (http://merosdobrasil.org) benefits the goliath grouper
                            Epinephelus itajara, the largest Atlantic grouper,
                        which is considered a critically endangered species according to IUCN
                        criteria and has been protected by the Brazilian Federal Law since 2002. The
                        Marine Management Areas Science Program is an international program of
                        Conservation International that is evaluating the effects of different
                        management regimes to devise the best actions for the future. Within this
                        context, the Abrolhos Shelf is part of a network attempting a similar
                        experiment in parallel, which includes four intensive study areas around the
                        globe (Brazil, Fiji, Belize, and Panama). Also in Abrolhos, the mesophotic
                        reefs, holding unique “twilight zone” assemblages, have been
                        revealed through a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional project in
                        which remotely operated vehicles have been used unveiling the potential of
                        the area for a variety of ecosystem services. The established Brazilian Marine Protected Areas, Marine Reserves, and Marine
                        Parks are fairly recent, the majority implemented with the intention to
                        conserve biodiversity and sustain the natural habitats of marine organisms
                        from all realms [167], [168], [276]. The
                        Marine State Park Parcel Manoel Luis, for instance, includes three coral
                        banks off the northern coast of Maranhão State, at the northern
                        distribution limit of several fish species that are endemic to the Brazilian
                        coast [167], [168]. Also, a complex
                        estuarine system of islands, bays, coves, and mangrove forests make up the
                        Reentrancias Maranhenses in the same state and is designated as a RAMSAR
                        site (http://www.mma.gov.br) because of its great importance for
                        numerous species of fish, shellfish, migratory birds, and manatees [167],
                            [168]. Other examples include Atol das Rocas and
                        Fernando de Noronha Marine National Park, both off the northeastern coast.
                        Apart from being a Marine Reserve, Atol das Rocas is also considered a
                        Natural World Heritage Site. It is the second largest reproductive area for
                        the sea turtle Chelonia mydas and the main reproductive
                        area for the seabird species Sterna fuscata, Sula
                            dactylatra, Sula leucogaster, Anous
                            stolidus, and Anous minutus. In the southern
                        coast, the Arvoredo Biological Marine Reserve (Reserva Biológica
                        Marinha do Arvoredo, RBMA) (27°17′7″S and
                        48°25′30″W) is an important nursery for many fish and other
                        marine invertebrates [281]. All these and other conservation units have
                        also been seen as a way of managing fisheries, especially where
                        multispecific techniques are used and conventional management tools do not
                        have any effect [276]. But several specialists have been pointing out
                        the need for the establishment of no-fishing zones, including in the deep
                        sea, as mechanisms for recovery and conservation of fish stocks [272]–[274]. Mangrove ecosystems cover 16 of the 17 Brazilian coastal states, representing
                        85% of the coastline (about 7,300 km), and are therefore crucial to
                        local communities but also subject to huge pressures and human impacts.
                        Mangrove ecosystems are among the most productive and have been considered
                        essential to a variety of natural resources and environmental services, as
                        they support economic activities and secure the environmental integrity in
                        tropical coastal areas. In recognition of the importance of these
                        ecosystems, the challenges of consolidatoffing and maintaining Mangrove
                        Conservation Units, the Ministry of Environment, in partnership with the
                        Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais
                        Renováveis – IBAMA (Brazilian Renewable Natural Resources and
                        Environmental Institute) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP),
                        has submitted a proposal to the Global Environment Facility called
                        “Project on the Conservation and Effective Sustainable Usage of
                        Brazilian Mangroves” (known as Projeto GEF Mangue). This project is to
                        raise funds to establish a network of protected areas that would allow the
                        conservation and sustainable use of this country's 13,400
                            km2 of mangroves (equivalent to 9% of the total
                        mangrove area worldwide) (http://www.mma.gov.br). Apart from these economically important ecosystems, marine mammals, seabirds,
                        and reptiles (mainly turtles) also receive special attention from NGOs and
                        environmental agencies in Brazil. Projeto TAMAR-IBAMA (National Sea Turtle
                        Conservation Program of Brazil), for instance, has a successful history of
                        conservation with a joint governmental and nongovernmental administration,
                        where local communities are involved [282]. Turtles have long
                        lives and grow slowly to adulthood over 20 to 50 years. They have complex
                        life cycles and use a variety of ecosystems, including the land where they
                        lay their eggs as well as coastal and oceanic waters where they feed,
                        develop, and mate [282], [283]. Five species of
                        turtles occur in the Brazilian coast: Caretta caretta,
                            Chelonia mydas, Eretmochelys
                        imbricata, Lepidochelys olivacea, and
                            Dermochelys coriacea
                        [282].
                        Former egg poachers have been employed through the TAMAR Project to patrol
                        the beaches and protect the nests, and this together with an education
                        program and ecotourism have promoted the conservation of endangered sea
                        turtles. Additionally, the project contributes to community festivals,
                        supports local schools and health care facilities, and assists in developing
                        alternative sources of income for residents who once had relied only on the
                        exploitation of sea turtles [282]. The project has
                        established 18 conservation stations covering 1,100 km of the Brazilian
                        mainland coast. Like birds, however, turtles face other threats such as
                        plastic debris and hook-and-line fishing bycatch [284]–[286],
                        and there is a need for further monitoring and to develop mitigation
                        measures [285]. Generally, Brazil is considered relatively poor in seabirds as a result of
                        the low productivity of its tropical waters [287]. But about 130 coastal
                        and marine species can be found throughout the coast and oceanic islands
                            [288]
                        . The great majority of these birds come from the Northern Hemisphere
                        between September and May, and from the meridional extreme between May and
                        August [288]
                        [283], to
                        mate and reproduce in marine protected areas such as the Atol das Rocas, are
                        crucial for the maintenance of these populations. Cetaceans are commonly sighted in along the Brazilian coast, and most studies
                        have been related to their occurrence [289]–[297],
                        abundance and distribution [252], [253], [298], diversity [204], [299],
                        ecology [251], [300], [301],
                        behavior and reproductive biology [246], [302],
                        stranding [303], [304] and accidental capture [305]–[307].
                        Parente et al. [299] have evaluated the relationship between seismic
                        surveys, oceanographic data, and diversity of cetaceans in Brazil since the
                        increase in seismic survey activities. This study suggests that there is a
                        decrease in the diversity of species over time, uncorrelated with changes in
                        oceanographic patterns, but rather associated with the increasing number of
                        seismic surveys. Nonetheless the authors recognize the need for further
                        observations and improved methodologies to analyze the cetaceans'
                        behavioral patterns. Apart from cetaceans, other mammals occur along the
                        Brazilian coast and deserve protection, including manatees that are commonly
                        found in mangrove areas in the North and Northeast regions and and fur seals
                        that occur in the southern part of the country near Chuí. Manatees
                            (Trichechus manatus) were hunted in the past for their
                        meat and skin and were at risk of extinction, but they are currently
                        protected by the Brazilian government. A dedicated center for the study and
                        protection of manatees (Centro Nacional de Pesquisa,
                        Conservação e Manejo de Mamíferos Aquáticos or
                        Centro Mamíferos Aquáticos/IBAMA) was created in 1980. At that
                        time, an extensive survey was carried out, areas of protection were
                        established, and regional executive bases were implemented especially in the
                        North and Northeast regions. This way, the animals have been rehabilitated;
                        some reproduce in captivity and their young are maintained until they are
                        ready for reintroduction to their natural environment. There are only two refuges for pinnipids along the whole Brazilian coastline,
                        and these are in Rio Grande do Sul state in the south. The South American
                        sea lion (Otaria flavescens) is the most anthropogenically
                        affected species, mainly because of its fishing interactions [214], [308] and
                        other authors therein). A program for the conservation and management of
                        pinnipids in Brazil (Programa de Conservação e Manejo dos
                        Pinípedes – NEMA/IBAMA) was implemented from 1993 to 2004 for
                        the protection of pinniped species that use the Rio Grande do Sul state
                        seashore, and two conservation units exist in the south, but further efforts
                        are necessary to promote environmental education, monitoring, and
                        appropriate handling of these animals [214]. Ferreira et al. [309] have compiled information on the threat of
                        invasive species for Brazil. They have considered that Brazil is undoubtedly
                        a major receptor and donor of tropical and subtropical organisms in the
                        world's oceans, taking into account the enormous variety of its marine
                        ecosystems and the extent of its coastline. Currently, 66 invasive species
                        have been recorded for the marine environment in Brazil from the following
                        groups: phytoplankton (3); macroalgae (10), zooplankton (10), zoobenthos
                        (38), fish (4), and pelagic bacteria (1) [310]–[312]. A trend toward increasing bioinvasion events in regional coastal ecosystems
                        may exist, but data are still sparse and locally produced [309].
                        According to these authors, there might be a bias in actual invasion rates
                        as a result of different research efforts in the recent past. As this is a
                        relatively new topic in Brazil, the first comprehensive lists of introduced
                        and invasive species are just beginning to be compiled, and the patterns of
                        invasion are not well understood [309], [313]. The Tropical West Atlantic region is bounded by the non-Caribbean section of the
                    coast of Venezuela as well as by Guyana (formerly British Guyana), Suriname, and
                    French Guiana, and defined by Longhurst [314] as the “Guianas
                    Coastal Province.” It extends for about 1,877 km along the Atlantic coast
                    of South America from the Brazilian border with French Guiana
                    (4°20′20″S, 51°22′12″W) to the northern section
                    of the Venezuelan Atlantic (10°39′22″N,
                    61°39′52″W). In the northern sector, the deltaic plains of the
                    Orinoco and the Gulf of Paria in the north Atlantic coast of South America cover
                    2,763,000 ha and constitute one of the major wetlands in South America as well
                    as one of the best preserved ecosystems in the world. The productivity of this
                    area is significant and one of the highest among neighboring areas in the
                    adjacent Caribbean [315] (Figure
                        4). These wetlands were formed by the combined action of sediment and
                    freshwater discharges from the Orinoco, one of the longest rivers in South
                    America (2,140 km) along with the tides on a flat alluvial plain [316]. The
                    physical and chemical characteristics as well as the ecosystems that develop in
                    this area are therefore defined by these factors [317]. The surface sea
                    temperature is relatively constant throughout the year
                    (27°C–28°C), and temperature drops to 12°C at 200 m depth
                        (Figure 3). During the
                    dry season, salinity at the Gulf of Paria is about 35–35‰, while
                    during the rainy season it may drop to 10‰ with variations in the
                    vertical gradient corresponding to an estuarine environment. Predominant winds
                    in this area are the northeast trade winds, with a mean speed of 6.6 m/s in the
                    Atlantic Front and 2 m/s in the Gulf of Paria. Winds show a seasonal pattern in
                    which the highest speeds are observed in January, February, and March (monthly
                    mean: 7.5 m/s), and the lowest in July, August, and September (monthly mean: 5.7
                    m/s). In most of the continental portion of Venezuela and many coastal areas,
                    wind intensity is also associated with cumulonimbus cloud systems, which are
                    often observed during the rainy season. The Venezuelan coast is not often
                    affected by hurricanes or tropical storms. However, these events can occur, and
                    hurricanes have at times reached the Venezuelan coast at a frequency of one
                    every 36 years. In these cases, wind speeds have increased to almost 40 m/s.
                    Wave pattern is also mostly determined by the northeast trade winds, although
                    this pattern may be altered by changes in wind intensity and by extratropical
                    cyclonic depressions that occur in the North Atlantic, generating waves that
                    reach the Venezuelan coasts as swells. Waves are usually 1–6.25 m in
                    height and frequently more than 4 m in May, November, and December. Offshore the
                    Orinoco Delta, currents are dominated by the Guayana Current, which flows mainly
                    toward the northwest at about 150 cm/s, significantly affecting the entire
                    region because of the large amounts of water it transports (Figure 2). On the other hand, the Orinoco
                    River discharges also affect the circulation pattern of the oceanic water mass
                    seasonally throughout the year (rainy and dry seasons). The Orinoco has the
                    world's third-largest flow (average discharge of 5.4×1011
                        m3/year), which, combined with that of the Amazon River, accounts
                    for 25% of all the freshwater discharged to the world's oceans.
                    Tides are usually semidiurnal and vary from 1.7 to 4.5 m depending on the zone
                        [318]. In the southern sector of this region, the climate in French Guiana is typically
                    wet equatorial, driven by the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Rainy season is
                    mainly between May and June, but there is a secondary rainy season in January
                    and February. Both periods greatly influence the Amazon River discharge, making
                    the waters extremely turbid. Tides are semidiurnal with an amplitude of up to
                    2.5 m. The main currents are the North Brazil Current becoming the Guianas
                    Current, which flows to the northwest and carries low-salinity waters rich in
                    nutrients and sediment from the Amazon (Figure 2). Upwelling is also characteristic
                    of this sector, providing more nutrients to the water but not decreasing
                    significantly its temperature [18] (Figures
                        3 and 4). From an ecological point of view, the coastal marine habitats in the northern
                    sector of this region can be divided into several subareas: (1) the coastal
                    fringe south of the Paria Peninsula, dominated by rocky shores, (2) the coastal
                    fringe of the Gulf of Paria and the Atlantic Ocean, dominated by mangroves, and
                    (3) the Atlantic coasts, dominated by soft bottoms and sandy beaches. All of
                    these are part of the “Gulf of Paria and Atlantic Front” ecoregion
                    as defined by Miloslavich et al. [319]. Each of these
                    subareas has ecologically distinct features that are determined by the
                    particular physiography, hydrodynamism, tides, sediments, physics, and chemistry
                    of the area. These conditions allow the development of distinct ecosystems along
                    this “variably stable” continental fringe that are characterized by
                    a total interdependency between biotic and abiotic components [315]. In the
                    southern sector, the coastal habitats are mainly mudflats, extensive mangrove
                    swamps, narrow sandy beaches, and brackish water creeks [18]. A total of 2,743 species have been reported in this region (Tables 6 and S9).
                        The most diverse groups were the fish (32%), followed by the
                        crustaceans (19%), the mollusks (16%), and the polychaetes
                        (6%). Despite having a large coastal extension, neither the Gulf of
                        Paria nor the Venezuelan Atlantic Front including the Orinoco Delta has been
                        well studied. Knowledge of the marine biodiversity of the area is scarce and
                        mostly reported in gray literature. The first studies of benthic communities
                        in the Gulf of Paria and the Venezuelan Atlantic Front were carried out in
                        the 1960s and 1970s, mostly focused on crustaceans [320], gastropods [321]–[328]. In the late 1990s and
                        early 2000s, baseline studies were carried out in the area in response to
                        the interest of oil and gas companies in establishing both offshore and
                        coastal developments. Such studies produced some species lists, but because
                        of the lack of taxonomic expertise, these are incomplete and do not reflect
                        well the actual biodiversity [316], [329]. Recently, more extensive biodiversity and
                        environmental impact studies have been developed [316], [318], [330], [331] and a
                        complete environmental baseline is compiled in Martín et al. [329].  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014631.t006 The OBIS database currently lists 2,095 species in the Tropical West
                        Atlantic, which represents 76% of the total as updated in this paper
                            (Table 2). Even
                        though most of these species are not new descriptions, a significant number
                        of them were not reported in this area until recently, particularly in the
                        Venezuelan Atlantic Front area. In this particular area, of the 1,561
                        species that have their collection date registered in OBIS (since 1884),
                        50% were collected between 2001 and 2004, and 47% between 1950
                        and 1980. In general, the best-known taxonomic groups are fish and
                        crustaceans, both important as fisheries resources, which account for about
                        51% of the total known biodiversity. The mollusks, for example,
                        usually the most diverse group, account for only about 15% of total
                        biodiversity, and the other major groups such as macroalgae, sponges,
                        cnidarians, and polychaetes account for less than 20% of the
                        total. The most recent review of decapod crustaceans of the lower Orinoco Delta
                        reports 30 species (23 genera and 12 families), of which the most abundant
                        were the shrimps Litopenaeus schmitti,
                            Macrobrachium amazonicum, and Xiphopenaeus
                            kroyeri
                        [332]. In
                        the Gulf of Paria, about 300 species have been reported, and of these, the
                        gastropods are the most diverse group (200 species), followed by the
                        crustaceans (22 species) and polychaetes (11 species) [333]. In the Atlantic
                        Front, sampling between 2001 and 2002, collected macrofauna of 11 phyla:
                        Protozoa, Porifera, Cnidaria, Nematoda, Nemertea, Annelida, Sipuncula,
                        Echiura, Mollusca, Crustacea, and Echinodermata. Of these, annelids (mainly
                        of the families Pilargidae, Spionidae, and Paraonidae) were the most
                        abundant group, representing 60.7% of total abundance, followed by
                        crustaceans (mainly peracarids) and bivalves with 15.4% and
                        9.3%, respectively, The most diverse polychaete famlies were
                        Onuphidae and Syllidae, followed by Paraonidae. The shallow zone (less than
                        200 m) had higher abundances than the deeper zones for all groups [330]. Other
                        important groups are the peracarid crustaceans, which were collected in
                        42% of the samples, amongst which the amphipods were the most
                        abundant group (57.8%), followed by the isopods (20.7%),
                        cumaceans (12.1%), and tanaidaceans (9.5%). Sampling was
                        carried out up to 200 m in depth and higher abundances were found in the
                        shallower zone, above 200 m (86%) [334]. Bone et al. [335] reviewed
                        the taxonomic composition of the Orinoco Delta benthic community and
                        reported a total biodiversity of 31 species belonging to four phyla
                        (Nematoda, Annelida, Mollusca, and Arthropoda), one subphyllum (Crustacea),
                        four classes (Polychaeta, Gasteropoda, Maxilopoda, and Malacostraca), two
                        subclasses (Ostracoda and Copepoda), one suborder (Peracarida), two orders
                        (Decapoda and Mysidacea), and 22 families. Few studies of the planktonic community have been made. A total of 367
                        species of marine and estuarine phytoplankton and 182 species of zooplankton
                        have been reported for the Orinoco Delta and its zone of influence in the
                        Atlantic Ocean. These communities are strongly influenced by rain and tidal
                        regimes [335]–[341]. The nektonic community
                        is also affected by rain seasonality, both in biodiversity and in biomass.
                        During the rainy season, fish diversity and biomass (29,318 t) are higher
                        and dominated by estuarine species. During the dry season, both fish
                        diversity and biomass (10,611 t) are lower and dominated by marine species.
                        This region has a great potential for future research and species discovery.
                        Few taxonomic groups are well known, while most of the groups are either
                        poorly known or almost unknown. The Tropical West Atlantic is heavily fished by local populations, and many
                        species, primarily fish and decapod crustaceans, have commercial value. For
                        some of these species, there is information about their biology
                        (reproduction, fecundity), ecology and fisheries [342]–[359]. The
                        impact of such fisheries on biodiversity is poorly known. Fisheries focus on
                        catching shrimp, scienid fish, and catfish, which are abundant in estuarine
                        habitats, and snappers and groupers, abundant in deeper waters and on rocky
                        bottoms. Historical data on industrial trawling fisheries have shown six
                        species of catfish, scienids, carangids, and lutjanids (snappers). The most
                        important species for longline artisanal fisheries have been the red snapper
                            (Lutjanus purpureus), the grouper Epinephelus
                            flavolimbatus, and the snapper Rhomboplites
                            aurorubens. The most important species captured with lines are
                        the “carite sierra” (Scomberomorus cavalla),
                        the barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda), the
                        “dorado” (Coryphaena hippurus), and the
                        “peto” (Acanthocybium solandri) [360]. Major threats to biodiversity in this region are industrial (trawling) and
                        artisanal (line and longline) fishing, urban development, agriculture
                        development, dredging and flow navigation, water pollution (runoff from the
                        Orinoco and Amazon basins), mangrove deforestation, activities related to
                        oil and gas exploitation, port activities, and maritime shipping [331]. These
                        authors assigned values to each of these threats according to their level of
                        menace on a scale from 1 to 8 (from least to highest impact). By this
                        measure, the most threatening activities are those related to oil and gas
                        exploitation, industrial fisheries, dredging, and mangrove deforestation. In
                        regard to industrial fishing, a new Fisheries and Aquaculture Law (article
                        23) has prohibited industrial shrimp trawl activities within
                        Venezuela's ocean territory and exclusive maritime economic zone,
                        starting on March 14, 2009. It is expected that the impact of this activity
                        will cease to be a problem in the near future at least within Venezuelan
                        waters. The impact of oil- and gas-related activities depends in great
                        measure on whether these activities are offshore or at the coastline. The
                        impact of offshore activities, when carried out within strict safety
                        parameters, are usually limited to the area surrounding the platforms. This
                        cannot be said of activities on the coast, where the impact is much greater
                        and is spread over a much larger area. Environmental catastrophes such as
                        the British Petroleum Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, despite being
                        extremely atypical, dramatically alert on the risks of carrying out such
                        environmentally risky activities in off shore areas without the proper
                        security measures. The Tropical West Atlantic region includes several MPAs within the different
                        countries covering nearly 10,900 km2 overall (land and sea). In
                        Venezuela, the Orinoco Delta and Gulf of Paria region have two protected
                        areas under special conservation regulations. These are the Turuépano
                        National Park in the Gulf of Paria, and the Orinoco Delta National Park. Of
                        these, the most impressive is the Orinoco Delta National Park, which is also
                        a Biosphere Reserve of mainly land and estuarine areas [319]. Recently, Klein
                        et al. [331] engaged in a conservation study in this area
                        carried out by the Universidad Simón Bolívar and the Nature
                        Conservancy to suggest and establish, based on conservation objects, marine
                        areas to be declared under protection. The conservation objects chosen for
                        this area were the rocky shores, the sandy beaches, and the soft bottoms.
                        One of the recommendations given by these authors for conservation is to
                        expand the Orinoco Delta National Park farther into the oceanic area to
                        protect the marine environments as well. In Guyana, there are no formally
                        established MPAs, but the 140 km long “Shell Beach,” a nesting
                        site for at least four species of marine turtles, is protected directly and
                        indirectly by conservation activities involving local communities. In
                        Suriname, there are seven MPAs, of which four are Nature Reserves and two
                        are multiple-use management areas. In French Guiana, there is only one
                        Nature Reserve of about 78 km2 of marine areas. The best-known marine phytoplankton taxonomic groups are diatoms and
                        dinoflagellates. As an example, in Mexican marine waters, the number of taxa
                        recorded is about 1,400 [361]. Recent
                        studies on phytoplankton dynamics complete this picture in South American
                        estuarine systems, including those of Gómez et al. [362],
                        Calliari et al. [363], Licursi et al. [364], and Carreto et al.
                            [365]
                        in the Río de la Plata and of Popovich and Marcovecchio [366] in
                        the Bahia Blanca estuary, as well as in littoral tropical systems [367]. On
                        the other hand, phytoplankton studies, together with food web and
                        biogeochemical flux estimations, have intensively been carried out in the
                        upwelling system off Chile [368]–[372] and in southern
                        Chilean fjords [373]. Phyto- and bacterioplankton dynamics are also
                        studied in French Guiana coastal and shelf systems under direct Amazon
                        influence [43], as well as in subtropical lagoons in southern
                        Brazil, focusing in phytoplankton dynamics and trophic fate [374], [375], and in
                        South Atlantic oceanographic frontal systems [376]–[378].
                        The diversity of picoeukarya and cyanobacteria was investigated at
                        intermediate shelf stations in the Patagonian system [43]
                        [40].
                        Microbial dynamics (Eukarya and Eubacteria) are intensively explored in
                        central Chile [379]–[383] and in the Peruvian
                        upwelling system [384], related to the oxygen minimum zone and big
                        upwelling productivity and remineralization patterns. Biogeographical issues
                        are also considered in a recent survey on bacterial assemblages (phylum
                        level) in surface waters from the Gulf of Mexico to the southeastern
                        tropical Pacific [385]. Bacterial dynamics and diversity are studied in
                        coastal lagoons in Uruguay [386], in sediments of fluid mud in French Guiana
                            [387],
                        in waters and sediments of the oxygen minimum zone off the South American
                        Pacific coast [388], and in anoxic waters of the Cariaco Basin
                            ([389],
                        Chistoserdov et al., upublished), where novel Eukarya are also studied [390]. In polluted coastal systems, bacteria with ability to degrade pesticides and
                        hydrocarbons are currently monitored. In coastal areas of the Colombian
                        Caribbean, 64 native marine bacterial strains were isolated from sediment
                        samples [391]. The oil-degrading bacteria are also studied in
                        the Orinoco Delta, which has been subject to intensive oil exploitation.
                        Furthermore, the Microbial Observatory of Rio de Janeiro (MoRio) [392], [393]
                        established in Guanabara Bay (Brazil), by exploring microbial biodiversity
                        in different coastal systems (including unpolluted sites) constitutes a
                        model for the study of threatened tropical coastal systems. The activity and
                        diversity of hydrocarbon- and oil-degrading bacteria are assessed also in
                        temperate waters and sediments of coastal systems of Argentina [394],
                            [395];
                        Dionisi et al., unpublished). Finally, symbionts and pathogenic microbes are
                        currently assessed in coral reefs of the Caribbean and South America [396], as
                        well as in mangroves [397] and extreme environments [398]. The regional analysis of South American marine biodiversity showed tremendous
                    heterogeneity not only in physical environments, including size and conditions,
                    but also in research capacity, history of exploration, and conservation actions.
                    Threats to biodiversity seem to be more or less common to all the subregions,
                    varying probably in the level of intensity from one subregion to another. South
                    American marine biodiversity is least well known in the Tropical East Pacific
                    (with the exception of Costa Rica and Panama) and the Tropical West Atlantic,
                    although the latter subregion has a slightly higher diversity when the total
                    number of species is standardized by coastal length—nearly 150 species in
                    100 km of coast (Table 7).
                    In the Tropical West Atlantic, particularly in the Venezuelan Atlantic Front,
                    sampling of marine biodiversity has intensified in recent years [316], [332], [333], [335], [339], [340],
                    significantly increasing our knowledge, but there are still many gaps and
                    unknowns. One of the major limits to the knowledge of marine biodiversity in
                    this region is the shortage of taxonomic expertise. As reported in Table 6, there are 2,743
                    species known to this region, of which 2,475 (90.2%) are from only five
                    major groups: fish and other vertebrates (birds being highly diverse),
                    crustaceans, mollusks, polychaetes, echinoderms, and macroalgae. This means that
                    overall diversity is probably highly underestimated, especially in less-known
                    taxonomic groups.  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014631.t007 From a biodiversity perspective, globally, coastal and shelf waters not only
                    present the greatest species richness (but see Gray, [399]) and highest productivity
                        [400] of
                    the world's oceans, but they also are biogeographically distinct from the
                    adjacent high seas and deep benthic environments [50], [401]. In the South American
                    continent, deep-sea exploration is relatively recent, and most efforts have been
                    concentrated in the southern countries, mainly Brazil (Table
                    S7). In general, the best-known taxonomic groups in the marine environments worldwide
                    are the cnidarians, mollusks, crustaceans, and echinoderms among the
                    invertebrates, and the fishes [402]. These groups together usually account for
                    50%–60% of the known marine biodiversity. In the global
                    analysis carried out by the National and Regional Committees of the Census of
                    Marine Life (see PLoS ONE collection “Marine Biodiversity and Biogeography
                    – Regional Comparisons of Global Issues”: http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/issue.pcol.v02.i09), the crustaceans,
                    molluscs, and fishes comprised approximately 50% of all known species
                    across the 25 regions studied [403]. In the OBIS database, for instance, which is the
                    largest marine biodiversity database in the world with nearly 25 million species
                    distribution records, from over 100,000 different species and 750 datasets (by
                    April 2010), these groups combined account for 69.7% of all species
                    (9.0% cnidarians, 11.4% mollusks, 23.0% crustaceans,
                    5.3% echinoderms, and 21.1% fishes). In the South American
                    subregions, these taxonomic groups account for 54.2% in the Tropical East
                    Pacific, 62.6% in the Humboldt Current, 65.3% in the Patagonian
                    Shelf, 64.6% in the Brazilian Shelves, and 75.7% in the Tropical
                    West Atlantic (Table 7).
                    The fact that their proportion in the Tropical East Pacific is much lower than
                    expected indicates that even for these well-known groups, there is still much to
                    discover. Data show important differences in total biodiversity between the Atlantic and
                    Pacific oceans at the same latitude. In this sense, as mentioned earlier, in the
                    north of the continent, the Tropical East Pacific is richer in total number of
                    species than the Tropical West Atlantic (a difference which is not so evident
                    when standardized by kilometers of coast), and in the south, the Humboldt
                    Current system is much richer than the Patagonian Shelf. It has been proposed that in marine environments, biodiversity is greatest in
                    tropical regions, decreasing gradually toward higher latitudes [404]–[407]. This trend has been
                    observed at the regional level in mollusks and isopods [405]–[408], but not in the local
                    patterns of intertidal macrobenthic fauna [409]. On the other hand,
                    intertidal assemblages of echinoderms at the global level have been reported to
                    peak in high northern latitudes and clearly decline with latitude, while
                    subtidal assemblages of echinoderms show no latitudinal trends but rather seem
                    to have regional diversity hotspots [410]. Empirical studies [411] and
                    meta-analysis [412] have shown that this relationship between latitude
                    and species richness is based on the decline of regional biodiversity (gamma
                    biodiversity) toward the poles, and not on the variation of the local community
                    richness (alpha biodiversity). Boltovskoy et al. [413] suggested that the
                    trend toward decreasing biodiversity with increasing latitude seemed to be
                    balanced by a higher biomass and endemism at higher latitudes. However, there
                    has been little systematic effort to document these patterns in the southwestern
                    Atlantic, and most existing efforts are almost exclusively focused on
                    invertebrates [108], [414]–[416]. On the other hand,
                    Gray [399],
                        [417]
                    reported that species richness in the Antarctic is high, questioning the
                    validity of the proposed latitudinal pattern. To test whether this pattern is
                    valid or not, it is necessary to review as much information as possible
                    regarding local and regional species richness [9]. In this sense, the above
                    mentioned global analysis [403], showed that the most diverse coastal areas in the
                    world are within Japanese and Australian waters (about 33,000 species each)
                    followed by Chinese waters (about 22,000 species). A recent analysis carried out
                    with about 11,500 species across 13 separate taxonomic groups of coastal and
                    oceanic environments, showed that there are different diversity patterns for
                    coastal and oceanic species, with coastal species being more diverse in the
                    equatorial West Pacific, and the oceanic species being more diverse in mid
                    latitudes. For all groups studied, sea surface temperature was identified as a
                    significant driver for these patterns, while habitat availability was
                    significant for most, however not all, of the groups [418]. In the north of the South American continent, the tropical Caribbean region, has
                    about 12,000 marine species, a number which is certainly higher than for any of
                    the subregions in this paper [20].The data reviewed here
                    shows that for the Atlantic Ocean, the tropical region has higher biodiversity
                    than the temperate region, varying from 146 species per 100 km of coast in the
                    Tropical West Atlantic to 122 species per 100 km of coast in Brazil, and to 67
                    species per 100 km of coast in the Patagonian Shelf (Table 2). On the other hand, this trend is
                    not evident in the Pacific Ocean, as the diversity in the Tropical East Pacific
                    is 132 species per 100 km of coast and a little higher in the Humboldt Current
                    system (140 species per 100 km of coast). When these comparisons are made within
                    particular taxonomic groups, the latitudinal trends mentioned earlier for total
                    biodiversity in the Atlantic Ocean can only be observed for fish and crustaceans
                        (Figure 7). Regional
                    “hot spots” of biodiversity for the best-known taxonomic groups seem
                    to be in the Tropical West Atlantic for fishes, in the Humboldt Current for
                    crustaceans, in Brazil and the Tropical West Atlantic for mollusks, and in
                    Brazil for macroalgae.  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014631.g007 There is not a clear relationship between increasing latitudes and increasing
                    species richness for macroalgae, and it has been stated that temperate regions
                    can achieve species numbers at least as high as those in the tropics [419]. In the
                    northern hemisphere, latitudinal macroalgal trends in species density and
                    biomass have been reported for some strata within the intertidal and shallow
                    subtidal zones, with more taxa and biomass at higher latitudes [420]. In the
                    southern hemisphere, the floras of the Patagonian coast, Tierra del Fuego, and
                    Malvinas are recorded among the most species diverse in the Southern Ocean [421]. The data
                    presented in this paper show that macroalgae are an important group for the
                    species richness of all regions, varying from 4.9% to 8.7% of
                    total species biodiversity. In regional trends, the highest biodiversity of
                    macroalgal species was found in the Brazilian region (10.6 species per 100 km of
                    coast), followed by the Humboldt Current system (7.3 species per 100 km of
                    coast), the Tropical West Atlantic (7.1 species per 100 km of coast), and the
                    Tropical East Pacific (6.0 species per 100 km of coast). The lowest diversity
                    was found for the Patagonian Shelf (4.7 species per 100 km of coast), which
                    could seem contradictory to the previous statement by John et al. [421], but this
                    could be because the relatively small hot spots of macroalgal diversity found in
                    the scarse rocky shores of the Patagonian Shelf are being “diluted”
                    among hundreds of kilometers of sandy coasts with no macroalgae. The trends discussed here, however, both for fauna and macroalgae, may not truly
                    reflect real patterns, as sampling has not been equal throughout the continent,
                    and taxonomic capacity is very uneven from one country to another as is the case
                    in the Caribbean [20]. These patterns are based on analysis of a thoroughly
                    updated biodiversity review as was carried out in each of the South American
                    subregions in this paper. But the patterns cannot be visualized correctly
                    because we do not know all the localities for all the species compiled here. To
                    visualize marine diversity distribution patterns in South America, we relied in
                    the OBIS database, which has more than 50% of the species for four of the
                    subregions (between 51% and 84%), and about 38% for the
                    Humboldt Current system (Table
                        2, Figure 8).
                    From this figure it is evident that all regions as reviewed in this paper have a
                    higher number of species than the number reported in OBIS (all dots above the
                    diagonal line), and that the biodiversity in some regions is well represented in
                    the OBIS database (e.g. Patagonian shelf) while in others, this is not the case
                    (e.g. Humboldt current). Strictly with OBIS data, the patterns of biodiversity
                    along the latitudinal gradient of the Atlantic Ocean are the same as those we
                    report with updated data, but that was not the case for the Pacific Ocean, where
                    the tropical zones show more diversity than the temperate zones (Figure 9). This difference is
                    probably because the Humboldt Current system is poorly represented in the OBIS
                    database. Based on this observed inconsistency, we tested for this particular
                    region, which has the largest latitudinal variation in the continent, whether
                    the expected pattern of biodiversity would have been different from the observed
                    pattern given a homogeneous sampling effort. To test for this, we used the
                    rarefaction technique to estimate the number of species that would have been
                    recorded in a given number of observations (e.g., Magurran, [422]). In
                    this analysis, we used a conservative number of 10 observations, which
                    corresponds to the standardized sample size used to estimate the richness per
                    cell using the rarefaction technique. An a posteriori
                    neighborhood operation was conducted to improve the detection of biogeographical
                    patterns. Using this function, we recalculated the values of each grid cell
                    using the mean, according to the values of the cells in a 3×3 neighborhood
                    around that cell. Later, the expected geographic pattern in biodiversity was
                    compared with the observed biogeographic pattern from this study, and the
                    provinces previously described for the southeastern Pacific coast by Camus [88].  A: Total number of species. B: Species per 100 km of coast. The largest

                            review).

              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014631.g009 The analysis of the distribution of patterns of richness along the Humboldt
                    Current system observed in the OBIS database showed three zones of high richness
                        (Figure 10) with the
                    highest values found in the Strait of Magellan. This zone of maximum diversity
                    is in accordance with previously described patterns of mollusk diversity on the
                    southern Pacific coast [423], as well as with the observed pattern for marine
                    invertebrates on the Chilean coast described by Lancellotti and Vásquez
                        [424], [425] and polychaetes by Hernández et al. [89]. This
                    zone of maximum diversity has historically experienced the combined effects of
                    climatic processes, tectonic activity, and glaciers, provoking the formation of
                    a large system of archipelagos, with an abundance of gulfs, fjords, and canals
                        [88]. This
                    zone has been associated with changes in local conditions (i.e., substrate
                    types, tidal amplitude, temperature, and salinity) [426], which would generate
                    a highly diversified mosaic of different biotopes [427], which would act as
                    refuges during repeated glacial advances over the last 40 million years [428]. The sum of
                    these factors would favor the local radiation of taxa, leading to the current
                    area of high taxonomic diversity in the Strait of Magellan
                    (52°–56°S) as reported in our study, and secondarily causing low
                    faunistic affinity with taxa from the Antarctic Peninsula [429].  Scale represents expected number of species. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014631.g010 In the northern zone, the bands of lowest diversity (off southern Peru between
                    15°–19°S and northern Chile between 25°–29°S, Figure 5) are strongly
                    influenced by the large-scale low-frequency spatial disturbances called El
                    Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This phenomenon provokes a series of
                    alterations in the structure of the current system and, consequently, the
                    coastal biota of the region, with regional-scale influences up to
                    30°–36°S [430], [431]. Since the appearance of ENSO about 5,000 years ago
                        [432],
                    the southeastern Pacific biota has experienced a continued disturbing influence,
                    and now ENSO is a critical component of regional dynamics, having played an
                    important role in defining the current biogeography of the area [90].
                    According to Camus [430], the characteristics of ENSO probably subjected
                    local populations to frequent bottlenecks and nonselective extinctions, which
                    could generate high interpopulational variability and even provoke founder
                    effects. These population-level processes, together with ENSO should have
                    produced increases in local diversity; however, while our results do not support
                    this hypothesis, they do support the ENSO hypothesis as a cause of extinctions
                    and low diversity in the zone. The low diversity of benthic polychaetes observed
                    in the northern zone can probably also be attributed to a low speciation rate,
                    due to the low differentiation of niches (i.e., low diversity of microhabitats)
                    observed in this zone with respect to the zone south of 41°S, which would
                    function as a biological mechanism determining local-scale diversity [433].
                    Additionally, as was proposed by Moreno et al. [434], the northern latitude
                    benthic richness of the HC potentially is controlled by the development of a
                    shallow oxygen minimum zone during the Neogene [435]. This phenomenon,
                    which is observed on the Peruvian and northern Chilean coasts, occurs at less
                    than 50 m depth [436]–[438] and strongly influences the
                    distribution and diversity of benthic marine species [439]. The rarefaction technique, used to evaluate the expected pattern of biodiversity,
                    showed a consistent pattern of increase in the richness of marine species toward
                    tropical latitudes (Figure
                        10). These results allow us to predict that a homogeneous sampling
                    effort will improve the OBIS database and provide more accurate patterns of
                    biodiversity. This expected pattern is a hypothetical scenario—constructed
                    on a conservative number of 10 observations—that can only be evaluated if
                    the OBIS database continues to grow, using new georeferenced data made available
                    not only from new studies of marine biodiversity in the HC, but also by
                    uploading in the OBIS system information that is already either in the
                    literature or in local databases. Research capacity is stronger in the southern countries of the continent, in
                    Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, which also have a longer history in marine
                    research. For example, contrary to what is generally stated abroad, the
                    southwest Atlantic has had many oceanographic and biological studies for many
                    years, but most past literature was mainly in Brazilian regional scientific
                    journals in Portuguese. Many molecular tools have been used to study latitudinal
                    gradients, identify cryptic and endemic species, and consider other questions
                    related to biodiversity [440]–[444]. In the last seven
                    years, a great effort has been made to incorporate data into open-access
                    databases such as OBIS, especially from Brazil and Argentina through their OBIS
                    nodes. However, there is still much information available locally that has to be
                    incorporated into the system, as was demonstrated for the Humboldt Current
                    system. On the other hand, it is true that even in the best-studied areas along
                    the vast South American coastline, there is still much to be done and
                    discovered, both in the continental shelf and especially in deep-sea
                    environments. Description of South American species began as early as the mid-1700s with
                        several peaks of discovery around 1850, 1900, and 1970 (Figure 11a). Since then, new species have
                        been added to the total every year exponentially (Figure 11b). A total of 13,656 species
                        are reported in OBIS for the five subregions considered in this paper. As
                        mentioned, this number could represent about half of the known species of
                        South America. As stated in tables 1, 3, 4,
                            5, and 6, the best known groups
                        in the region (those ranked mostly between 4 and 5 in the “state of
                        knowledge” category) are fish, mollusks, crustaceans, echinoderms,
                        cnidarians, and macroalgae. The rate of discovery for these best-known
                        taxonomic groups has been variable, and the number of fish, mollusk, and
                        crustacean species is continuously increasing. However, this is not true of
                        cnidarians, echinoderms, and macroalgae, which seem to have reached a
                        relatively stable number, with few new additions (Figure 12). This stability certainly
                        indicates that these groups have been neglected in the region, probably the
                        consequence of a combination of factors, including lack of taxonomic
                        expertise, limited funding for research, lack of collecting effort, and
                        limited access to sampling sites. However, these curves are based in OBIS
                        data which has an iconsistent subset of data for the region, with some
                        regions (e.g. Brazil) better represented than others (e.g. Humboldt
                        Current), so a full species inventory is needed to confirm if these patterns
                        are valid. On the other hand, given the richness of these three groups in
                        the world context (Bouchet, [402] has reported a total
                        of 9,795 cnidarians, 7,000 echinoderms, and 10,300 macroalgae), it seems
                        unlikely that such low numbers represent the total regional biodiversity of
                        these groups for such a vast area as South America. While it is true that
                        new descriptions of some well-known groups such as vertebrates have
                        decreased in the last decade, the application of new molecular methods at a
                        broader global scale, together with the exploration of the less explored
                        environments will undoubtedly help to improve and refine the knowledge on
                        marine biodiversity. In addition, shifts in species distribution associated

              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014631.g011  Data from OBIS database (using only “valid names” which
                                corrects for synonyms). 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014631.g012 Two interesting questions can be asked about the 13,656 species that compose
                        about half of the known biodiversity of South America. The first is, how
                        many of them are exclusive to one subregion or are shared by two or more
                        subregions, and in which proportion? This is a question of endemism within
                        regions of South America. The second question is, how many of these species
                        are exclusive to South America and in which taxonomic groups? This is a
                        question of South American endemism within a global context. To answer the
                        first question, we sorted the number of species in the OBIS database that
                        are present in one, two, three, four, and five subregions, and how they were
                        distributed (Table 8).
                        A total of 10,311 species are reported to exist exclusively in only one
                        South American subregion, that is, 75.5% of the total species
                        reported for the region. Among the subregions, this endemism within South
                        America represents 71.2% of the species for the Tropical East Pacific
                        (2,452 species), 43.4% for the Humboldt Current (1,691 species),
                        48.2% for the Tropical West Atlantic (896 species), 71.6% for
                        Brazil (3,921 species), and 42.6% for the Patagonian Shelf (1,351
                        species). On the other hand, the number of species shared by two or more
                        subregions decreased as the number of subregions involved increased; with 28
                        species shared by all five subregions (comprising mainly protists, a few
                        cnidarians, and the killer whale, Orcinus orca).  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014631.t008 To answer the second question, we filtered from the global database the
                        species that are only found around South America, that is, the species that
                        have not been reported elsewhere in the world. The total number of species
                        that are “endemic” to South America within the global context
                        according to the data in OBIS is 3,065 species, which represents
                        22.4% of the total reported for the region. These species represent
                        several phyla, of which the most abundant were the mollusks (42%),
                        followed by the arthropods (mainly crustaceans: 23%), and the
                        chordates (fish and other vertebrates: 12%). Polychaetes, cnidarians,
                        sponges, echinoderms, and nematodes accounted altogether for 19% of
                        these “endemic” species. Although this is a good estimate of
                        endemism for the region, the numbers could change as new data are
                        incorporated into the OBIS database. For instance, it is possible that a
                        species considered as “endemic” to South America could have been
                        observed outside the region but that these records have not been published
                        in OBIS. Moreover, with new exploration, species considered to be endemic to
                        South America could appear elsewhere, and would no longer be considered
                        endemic. The total number of endemic species as reviewed in this paper was
                        886 (67 for the Tropical East Pacific, 197 for the Humboldt Current system,
                        4 for the Tropical West Atlantic, 446 for Brazil, and 172 for the Patagonian
                        Shelf). These low numbers in relation to what is reported in OBIS as
                        exclusive of South America indicate that regional knowledge about which
                        species are endemic is generally poor, especially for tropical areas, both
                        Pacific and Atlantic. Other regions of extremely high endemism are New
                        Zealand and Antarctica with about 48% of endemic species [445], [446],
                        followed by Australia and South Africa with about 28% of endemic
                        species [447], [448] all of which are
                        located in the Southern Hemisphere as is most of South America. Griffiths et
                        al. [448] reported high levels of species endemism for
                        South African waters (around 4,233 species), a number that is subject to
                        change as some species are being reported in other countries. Among these
                        endemic species, the bryozoans and the mollusks showed high levels of
                        endemism (64% and 56%, respectively), while echinoderms and
                        sponges had much lower levels of endemism (3.6% and 8.8%,
                        respectively). Assuming our estimate of endemism is valid, then South
                        America could be considered as a region of high endemism for mollusks, as
                        has been reported for some localities in Brazil [449]. In New Zealand [445], there
                        are 6,741 endemic species, of which nearly 3,000 are mollusks. In this
                        sense, both New Zealand and South Africa have good knowledge of their
                        species richness and endemism, and South America has yet to attain it. For
                        instance, it has been discussed that seamounts in Brazil seem to be highly
                        endemic (see Bouchet & Leal, [450] for reports on the
                        gastropod fauna of Brazilian seamounts and their reproductive modes, as well
                        as Vaske Jr et al., [235] on deep-water scorpion fish). This raises
                        interesting questions related to reproductive and developpmental strategies,
                        endemism, and faunistic relationships between the Brazilian continental
                        margin and other parts of the Atlantic: Would Brazilian seamounts function
                        as stepping stones in the Atlantic Ocean? How much more endemism do they
                        hold, and what is the relationship between species found on seamounts and
                        those found on the continental margin? Would seamounts act as a gene source
                        or sink? Increasing our knowledge of seamounts would allow us a better
                        understanding of how they function, and provide better baselines for
                        management and conservation, especially if seamounts are repositories of
                        unique biodiversity. As mentioned earlier, the heterogeneity and vast extent of the South American
                        coast and the diversity of habitats and oceanographic conditions there have
                        important implications for biodiversity. We have discussed the state of
                        knowledge of marine biodiversity, observed latitudinal trends, the potential
                        endemism of the region, and the limits of our knowledge. South America is
                        certainly in a good position to improve its expertise and is likely to
                        advance in some regions, such as Brazil, sooner than in others. National and
                        regional initiatives in new exploration, especially to unknown areas and
                        ecosystems, as well as collaboration between the different countries is
                        fundamental to achieving the goal of completing inventories of species
                        diversity and distribution that will allow accurate interpretation of the
                        biogeography of the continent, latitudinal trends, and differences between
                        its two oceanic coasts. Spalding et al. [52] proposed a
                        bioregionalization of the coastal and shelf areas of the world based in
                        ecoregions. These ecoregions extend beyond national borders and even beyond
                        continents. It would had been interesting to make the same analysis we have
                        done here but comparing among ecoregions instead of the regions used in this
                        paper. However, this is not possible with the present state of knowledge,
                        because most of the data compiled here relate to a specific country rather
                        than to geographic coordinates, as can be found in OBIS. Thus, an extra
                        effort to compile all species records in the literature, validate the
                        taxonomy of these records, and make them available through open-source
                        databases such as OBIS is of outmost importance and must be encouraged and
                        supported by local governments through biodiversity policies. In this paper,
                        we have attempted such a compilation, and in doing so, we have become even
                        more aware of the magnitude of the work still to be done to move on to the
                        next level of knowledge and understanding. Sources of information used to estimate total number of marine species for
