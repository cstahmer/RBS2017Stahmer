   Cyan fluorescent proteins (CFPs), such as Cerulean, are widely used as donor
                    fluorophores in Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments.
                    Nonetheless, the most widely used variants suffer from drawbacks that include
                    low quantum yields and unstable flurorescence. To improve the fluorescence
                    properties of Cerulean, we used the X-ray structure to rationally target
                    specific amino acids for optimization by site-directed mutagenesis. Optimization
                    of residues in strands 7 and 8 of the β-barrel improved the quantum yield of
                    Cerulean from 0.48 to 0.60. Further optimization by incorporating the wild-type
                    T65S mutation in the chromophore improved the quantum yield to 0.87. This
                    variant, mCerulean3, is 20% brighter and shows greatly reduced
                    fluorescence photoswitching behavior compared to the recently described
                    mTurquoise fluorescent protein in vitro and in living cells. The fluorescence
                    lifetime of mCerulean3 also fits to a single exponential time constant, making
                    mCerulean3 a suitable choice for fluorescence lifetime microscopy experiments.
                    Furthermore, inclusion of mCerulean3 in a fusion protein with mVenus produced
                    FRET ratios with less variance than mTurquoise-containing fusions in living
                    cells. Thus, mCerulean3 is a bright, photostable cyan fluorescent protein which
                    possesses several characteristics that are highly desirable for FRET
                    experiments. Citation: Markwardt ML, Kremers G-J, Kraft CA, Ray K, Cranfill PJC, Wilson KA, et al.  (2011) An Improved Cerulean Fluorescent Protein with Enhanced Brightness and Reduced Reversible Photoswitching. PLoS ONE 6(3):

                    application from the University of Maryland, Baltimore titled "Fluorescent
                    Proteins and Uses Thereof" (SN 61/249,712). This patent covers the mutations
                    used to derive mCerulean2 and mCerulean2.N variants that are the precursors to
                    mCerulean3. Although the authors are pursuing commercial licensing and sale of
                    their CFP reagents through companies like Clontech and Life Technologies, this
                    does not alter their acceptance and adherence to the PLoS ONE policy as well as
                    National Institutes of Health (NIH) policy for reagent sharing. All reagents
                    described in the article are freely available upon reasonable request for the
                    purpose of academic, non-commercial research, which will likely include
                    deposition of the plasmids encoding mCerulean3 in a repository such as
                    addgene.org. A full complement of colors for genetically-encoded fluorescent proteins has nearly
                been achieved. Nonetheless, many fluorescent proteins suffer from low brightness and
                unstable fluorescence that limits their utility for live cell microscopy [1]. Additional
                disadvantages include properties such as a low quantum yield (QY) [2], inefficient
                maturation [3], or
                suboptimal excitation by existing illumination sources [4]–[6]. Thus, there is continued interest
                in developing fluorescent proteins with properties that are better suited for
                quantitative microscopy applications. Among the most widely used fluorescent proteins are those derived from the Aequorea
                victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) [7]. The chromophores of
                fluorescent proteins are formed from three amino acid residues positioned in the
                interior of the compact β-barrel structure [8]. Spontaneous main chain cyclization
                of residues 65 and 67 (wild-type GFP) leads to formation of a cyclic α-enolate,
                that either in its hydrated or dehydrated form, is thought to undergo oxidation to
                the cyclic imine form. Net elimination of a water molecule and proton abstraction at
                the β carbon of Tyr66 produces a mature chromophore containing a
                five-membered heterocycle that is fully conjugated to the phenolic group of
                    Tyr66[9]–[12]. Molecular engineering of the chromophore-forming amino acid residues can change both
                the absorption and emission spectra of the protein, producing blue, cyan and
                enhanced green fluorescent variants [13]. Replacement of Tyr66 with a tryptophan
                residue introduces the larger indole group into the chromophore π-system, and
                paradoxically blue-shifts the spectra by ∼30 nm to produce the widely used set
                of CFPs [14].
                Importantly, the spectral properties of fluorescent proteins are determined not only
                by the chromophore structure alone, but can also be influenced by interactions with
                the surrounding β-barrel side chains via effects on chromophore orientation,
                energetics or conformation [15]. For CFPs, the absorption spectra can be approximated by
                molecular dynamics simulations [16], [17] that have provided a great deal of insight into the
                experimental observations that side-chain protonation and chromophore conformations
                can influence both the brightness and absorption spectra of Cerulean [18]. Nonetheless,
                absorption spectra calculations using these models currently lack the double peak
                observed experimentally, indicating that a full understanding of the photophysical
                phenomena underlying the spectral properties of CFPs has not yet been achieved. Although CFPs are generally dim in comparison to GFPs [1], their blue-shifted fluorescence
                has made CFPs a popular choice for Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)
                experiments when paired with yellow fluorescent proteins (YFPs) such as Citrine
                    [19] or
                Venus [3]. FRET is
                typically detected by quantifying changes in sensitized YFP emission, either
                ratiometrically with CFP fluorescence or using a corrective algorithm.
                Alternatively, the quenching effect of FRET on CFP fluorescence can be detected by
                photobleaching YFP or by measuring changes to the CFP fluorescence lifetime. Despite
                the convenience of the CFP color, the most commonly used CFPs do have drawbacks that
                limit their utility in FRET experiments. For example, the low QY of commonly used
                CFPs [20], [21] limits FRET
                efficiency and the range of energy transfer [22]. Instability of CFP
                fluorescence can also be problematic for time-resolved FRET experiments. Although
                corrective measures have been developed to account for photobleaching [23], [24], application
                of these methods is complicated by the reversibility of the fluorescence loss. This
                phenomenon is known as reversible photoswitching and has been observed for several
                fluorescent proteins including Cerulean [25]. Improvements to CFPs that
                target QY and photostability are thus particularly important for quantitative FRET
                experiments. To improve the properties of Cerulean CFP [20] fluorescence, we optimized amino
                acids in the β-barrel and in the chromophore. The resulting protein is
                67% brighter than the original Cerulean fluorescent protein and 21%
                brighter than the recently reported mTurquoise fluorescent protein [26], which is a
                high QY CFP derived from the alternative super-folding CFP lineage (SCFP3A) [21]. Although
                brightness was improved, the absorption and emission spectra of mCerulean3 did not
                change substantially compared to previous CFPs, including the original Cerulean.
                mCerulean3 also shows greatly reduced reversible photoswitching, and performs well
                as a fusion protein. In addition, we show that mCerulean3 provides quantitative
                advantages for FRET experiments over previous CFP variants. The crystal structure of Cerulean [18], [27] reveals an extended separation between β-strands
                    7 and 8 (Figure 1A, in red
                    and green, respectively). In general, unfolding fluorescent proteins reduces
                    fluorescence, and direct manipulation of the β-strands by the addition of
                    biosensing domains is known to modulate the molecular brightness of fluorescent
                    proteins [3],
                        [28], [29]. Thus, we
                    hypothesized that optimizing the amino acids that comprise β-strands 7 and 8
                    might improve the overall brightness of Cerulean. Random mutations were
                    introduced in pairs into the monomeric variant of Cerulean (mCerulean) [5] using
                    degenerate primers (Table S1). Plasmid DNA containing mCerulean
                    mutants were transformed into XL10 bacteria and colony fluorescence was examined
                    by fluorescence microscopy. Plasmids isolated from the brightest colonies were
                    used to generate recombinant proteins for characterization. Although increased
                    colony brightness could result from factors unrelated to protein brightness,
                    such as cell density or differences in protein concentration within the
                    bacterial cells, we did find that increased colony brightness was associated
                    with increased molecular brightness in purified proteins. Mutant CFPs with the
                    highest QYs were selected for additional rounds of optimization. The end product
                    from this series of optimization, mCerulean2, contains 6 mutations
                    (S147H/D148G/K166G/I167L/R168N/H169C; sequence alignment in Figure S1)
                    and is 30% brighter than Cerulean (Table 1) while maintaining similar absorption
                    and emission spectra (Figure
                        2). Thus, optimization of residues in β-strands 7 and 8 improved
                    the fluorescence of Cerulean.  A site-directed mutagenesis strategy was employed to optimize Cerulean
                            fluorescence. (A) Residues on β-strand 7 (S147, D148; red),
                            β-strand 8 (L166, I167, R168, H169; green) in the Cerulean X-ray
                            structure (2wso.pdb [27]) were targeted for optimization by
                            site-directed mutagenesis. The chromophore is colored blue. (B) T203
                            (orange) was targeted for optimization due to its proximity to the
                            chromophore. T65 (green) was also mutated. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017896.g001  Absorption (dashed lines) and emission spectra (solid lines) are shown
                            for Cerulean (black), mCerulean2 (green), mCerulean2.N (red), and
                            mCerulean3 (blue). Spectra were normalized to the peak absorption or
                            emission values.

              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017896.t001 Although the QY of mCerulean2 is 25% greater than Cerulean, it is quite
                    far from the theoretical maximum. Optimization of Thr203 (Figure 1B), which is proximal
                    to the chromophore, is known to improve the fluorescence properties of some
                    Aequorea-derived GFP variants [30]. To assess whether optimization of Thr203
                    can enhance the fluorescence properties of mCerulean2, we performed random
                    mutagenesis on this position using degenerate PCR, and screened
                    mutant-containing bacterial colonies for brightness. The brightest protein
                    identified contained the T203I mutation and was named mCerulean2.N. This variant
                    has a ∼9 nm red shift in its fluorescence spectra (Figure 2) which may provide advantages for
                    certain applications since the peak absorption is more closely aligned with 440
                    nm and 458 nm laser sources compared to mCerulean2. Furthermore, the ∼9 nm
                    shift in the emission spectrum is large enough to permit resolution from the
                    Cerulean spectrum by linear unmixing [31], thus adding another
                    potential color for spectral imaging applications. Nonetheless, the gains in QY
                    observed from the mCerulean2 mutations were negated, even though the molar
                    extinction coefficient was improved. Therefore, mCerulean2.N is a CFP of similar
                    brightness to Cerulean with spectral properties that are more closely aligned
                    with existing laser excitation sources commonly used for fluorescence
                    microscopy. To further improve mCerulean2 fluorescence, we examined the effect of reverting
                    position Thr65 in the chromophore to the wild-type serine residue.
                    Early cyan mutants containing the Ser65 had much higher QYs (W2;
                    QY = 0.72) [14] than the widely used S65T-containing ECFP (originally
                    W1B; QY = 0.4) [30]. Furthermore, it has
                    recently been shown that the wild-type T65S substitution can improve the QY of
                    blue fluorescent proteins [2], [32]. Incorporation of T65S into mCerulean2 (mCerulean3)
                    successfully improved the QY of mCerulean2 by 45% and the overall
                    brightness by 25% (Table
                        1) without changing the absorption or fluorescence emission spectra
                        (Figure 2). The acid
                    stability of mCerulean3 (pKa = 3.2) was also better than
                    mCerulean2 (pKa = 4.8), mCerulean2.N
                    (pKa = 4.5) and mCerulean (pKa = 4.7).
                    In contrast, incorporation of T65S into mCerulean2.N did not improve overall
                    fluorescence, and slightly reduced both the QY and the extinction coefficient.
                    Thus, incorporation of the wild-type Ser65 into mCerulean2 greatly
                    improved fluorescence through a mechanism that is incompatible with the T203I
                    mutation, the precise nature of which is unknown. We compared the fluorescence properties of the brightest CFP we developed,
                    mCerulean3, with another recently developed CFP that also contains the T65S
                    mutation, mTurquoise [26]. Overall, we found mCerulean3 to be approximately
                    20% brighter than mTurquoise while the absorption and emission peaks are
                    similar (Table 1). Like
                    mTurquoise, the fluorescence lifetime of mCerulean3 determined by
                    time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) spectroscopy fits well to a
                    single exponential component. The maturation times of mTurquoise and mCerulean3
                    are also very similar (Table
                        1). Thus, the steady-state spectral qualities of mCerulean3 are
                    roughly equivalent to mTurquoise, with mCerulean3 being the brighter of the
                    two. By convention, we measured the fluorescence decay times for beads labeled with
                    CFPs under continuous illumination. mCerulean2 and mTurquoise behaved similarly
                    to mCerulean; however, mCerulean3 was resistant to fluorescence decay under
                    these conditions. We observed an ∼18-fold longer decay half time for
                    mCerulean3 than mTurquoise. Nonetheless, measurement of fluorescence decay times
                    under continuous illumination has generally not provided reproducible results
                    between laboratories [20], [21], [33], and therefore may not be the most useful predictor
                    of performance. In addition, measurement of the rate of decay under continuous
                    illumination does not take into account that some of the fluorescence loss may
                    be reversible [25] and not indicative of a true photobleach. To
                    distinguish between reversible photoswitching and irreversible bleaching, we
                    imaged beads labeled with recombinant fluorescent proteins at 1 min intervals to
                    establish baseline fluorescence using a low-power illumination intensity that we
                    have successfully used for observation of living cells expressing CFPs. During
                    the imaging protocol we illuminated continuously for a 1 min period to observe
                    the extent of fluorescence decrease, and resumed imaging at 1 min intervals to
                    quantify the extent of reversible photoswitching (Figure 3A, B). For Cerulean, and to a lesser
                    extent, mTurquoise, the reduction of fluorescence induced by the 1 min
                    illumination period was highly variable (for Cerulean,
                    −17.6±8.6% reduction; all values are mean ± standard
                    deviation (SD)) (Figure 3C).
                    In addition, reversible fluorescence photoswitching was observable for both
                    mTurquoise and Cerulean, and accounted for roughly half of the fluorescence
                    decrease observed for mTurquoise beads over the 1 min continuous illumination
                    period. In contrast, mCerulean3 was refractory to fluorescence reduction
                    (1%±0.4, n = 15). Interestingly, we did not
                    observe reversible photoswitching in beads labeled with mCerulean2.N, although
                    the extent of irreversible photobleaching was extensive (Figure 3C). Taken together, we find that
                    recombinant mCerulean3 is exceptionally photostable compared to other
                    Aequorea-derived CFPs.  Agarose beads labeled with CFPs as indicated were imaged at 60 s
                            intervals under low power illumination (45 µW/cm2). At
                            5 min, the beads were continuously illuminated for 60 s (red bar). (A)

              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017896.g003 To test the suitability of mCerulean3 as a fusion protein, we fused it to a
                    variety of different localization partners, including actin, myosin, and
                    organelle-localized domains (Figure
                        4). Bright, successfully localized fusions were accomplished using
                    both the N-terminus and C-terminus of mCerulean3, including those that require
                    monomeric character, such as α-tubulin, intermediate filaments, connexin 43,
                    histone H2B, and β-actin. Thus, mCerulean3 is suitable as a fusion partner
                    for a broad range of molecular targets.  Images were recorded in widefield or laser scanning confocal fluorescence

              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017896.g004 Although the photostability of existing CFPs is sufficient to enable their
                    widespread use in a great number of applications, reversible photoswitching in
                    living cells has the potential to introduce an undesirable source of error in
                    quantitative applications. To examine the fluorescence photoswitching behavior
                    of CFPs in COS-7 cells, we bleached cells to 50% of their initial
                    fluorescence by continuous illumination of the full field of view over several
                    minutes. Reversible photoswitching was then quantified as the percent increase
                    in fluorescence at 15 min compared to the post-bleach fluorescence intensity
                        (Figure 5). In COS-7
                    cells, mTurquoise fluorescence recovered to a smaller extent than Cerulean,
                    although the amount of reversible photoswitching was statistically significant
                    (P<0.001, t-test, comparison to 0, n = 20). In contrast,
                    we observed very little reversible photoswitching in cells expressing mCerulean3
                    (2.5%±6.2, n = 20), and the small amount
                    observed was not statistically significant (t-test, comparison to 0, P>0.05).
                    Thus, mCerulean3 performs well as a fusion protein and displays very little
                    fluorescence photoswitching when expressed in living cells.  COS7 cells expressing the indicated CFP were examined by widefield
                            microscopy. Cells were bleached to 50% of their initial
                            fluorescence by continuous, high intensity illumination of the full
                            field of view. Recovery of cellular fluorescence was examined 15 min
                            following the bleaching period. Data indicates the mean %
                            recovery of bleached fluorescence after 15 min

              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017896.g005 The CFP:YFP pairing is a widely used combination for FRET experiments in living
                    cells. Consistent with dependence of FRET on the donor QY [22], the calculated
                    Förster distance where half maximal energy transfer occurs (R0)
                    was improved for pairing mCerulean3 with the mVenus YFP [3] compared to the monomeric
                    mCerulean alone (Table 2),
                    whereas the Förster distances calculated for mTurquoise and mCerulean3 were
                    very similar. These trends were reflected experimentally in HeLa cells
                    expressing a fused CFP:YFP dimer containing mCerulean, mTurquoise, or mCerulean3
                    coupled to mVenus. FRET efficiencies were determined in single cell preparations
                    using acceptor photobleaching (Table 2). FRET efficiencies for mTurquoise and mCerulean3-containing
                    fusions were greater than the mCerulean fusion (P<0.001,
                    n = 15, ANOVA, Tukey multiple comparison for
                    mTurquoise:mCerulean, and mCerulean3:mTurquoise); however, FRET efficiencies
                    obtained for mCerulean3 and mTurquoise fusions were not significantly different
                    (P>0.05). These findings are consistent with the calculated
                    R0.  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017896.t002 Accurate FRET efficiencies can be obtained by measuring changes to the donor
                    fluorescence lifetime in the presence of the acceptor [34], and FRET-induced changes to
                    CFP lifetimes can be observed by fluorescence lifetime microscopy (FLIM) [5], [35]. We
                    quantified the FRET efficiencies of our fusion constructs using frequency domain
                    FLIM. Fluorescence lifetimes obtained by FLIM (Figure S2)
                    for mCerulean (τ = 3.00±0.06,
                    n = 10), mCerulean3
                    (τ = 3.97±0.04, n = 10),
                    and mTurquoise (τ = 4.00±0.05,
                    n = 10) were in fairly good agreement with values obtained
                    for recombinant proteins using time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC)
                    spectroscopy (Table 1).
                    There was more divergence with the frequency-domain FLIM and TCSPC values for
                    Cerulean. This finding is in agreement with previous reports and the divergence
                    is believed to result from the complexity of the Cerulean lifetime [21], [26]. FRET
                    efficiencies obtained with FLIM also agreed with results obtained from donor
                    dequenching (Table 2),
                    with mCerulean3 and mTurquoise-containing fusions showing significantly more
                    FRET than Cerulean (P<0.001, n = 10, ANOVA, Tukey
                    multiple comparison for mTurquoise:mCerulean, and mCerulean3:mTurquoise). As we
                    had observed with donor dequenching, FRET efficiencies for mCerulean3 and
                    mTurquoise containing fusions were not significantly different from each other
                    (P>0.05, n = 10, ANOVA, Tukey multiple comparison test).
                    Taken together with the acceptor photobleaching data, the recently developed
                    high QY CFPs show measurable improvement over Cerulean in the efficiency of
                    CFP:YFP FRET. Many CFP:YFP FRET experiments utilize the ratio of the donor and acceptor
                    fluorescence to detect changes induced by biosensing of cellular phenomena [36]; however,
                    the instability and decay of CFP fluorescence over time could in theory affect
                    the absolute FRET ratio if the decay in CFP fluorescence is shorter than the
                    image capture time. To examine this in the context of FRET-ratio imaging, we
                    labeled beads with recombinantly-generated CFP:YFP pairs, and examined the FRET
                    ratio of beads over a broad range of image capture times using wide-field
                    microscopy (Figure 6A). FRET
                    ratios from fusions containing mCerulean or mTurquoise and mVenus were
                    10–20% less at long illumination times (∼1 s) compared with
                    short ones (<1 ms) (Figure
                        6A). In contrast, FRET ratio measurements performed using mCerulean3
                    as a donor varied less than 2.5% as exposure time was varied over 4
                    orders of magnitude. To look at the impact of mCerulean3 photostability on FRET
                    ratios observed in living cells, we expressed the same FRET fusion proteins
                    containing mVenus that we used for the bead preparations in HEK cells (Figure 6B). Using mCerulean as
                    the FRET donor, we observed FRET ratios ranging from 1 to 2.6 (Figure 6B), with a large SD of
                    ±0.57 (n = 50). FRET ratios obtained for mTurquoise
                    fusions were less variable (±0.37, n = 50), but the
                    SD was still 2.5-fold greater than the results obtained with mCerulean3 fusions
                    (±0.15, n = 50). Given that the improvement observed
                    using mCerulean3 over mTurquoise is quite large compared to a small brightness
                    advantage, it is likely that reduced photoswitching is the major component of
                    the reduced variability. Thus, utilization of mCerulean3 as donor protein in
                    FRET experiments reduces variability in ratio measurements.  (A) To test the dependence of measured FRET ratios on illumination time,
                            agarose beads were labeled with equivalent concentrations of the
                            indicated CFP:mVenus fusion protein. Beads were imaged consecutively
                            using constant illumination intensity (455 nm LED, 600
                                µW/cm2), but a varied illumination period. Cyan and
                            yellow fluorescence were captured simultaneously using an Optical
                            Insights Dual-View containing standard CFP/YFP filter sets. FRET ratios
                            were normalized to the peak FRET ratio. Points indicate the mean and
                            error bars indicate SEM (n = 10). (B) HEK293 cells
                            were transfected with the indicated fusion, and observed by fluorescence
                            microscopy. The yellow/cyan FRET ratio of individual cells is shown
                            (n = 50). Bar indicates the mean, and error bars
                            indicate SD. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017896.g006 Here we report development of a brighter, more photostable Cerulean CFP with very
                    desirable characteristics for quantitative fluorescence microscopy applications.
                    mCerulean3 has very high QY and a single exponential fluorescence lifetime,
                    making it a very useful donor fluorophore for FRET experiments. The reduced
                    photoswitching behavior is also an important advantage for quantitative
                    applications such as FRET and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching.
                    Compared to the other high QY CFP, mTurquoise, FRET with mCerulean3 is similarly
                    efficient, but can be quantified with greater precision. FRET ratios obtained
                    with mCerulean3 display less variance in test preparations and in living cells.
                    Reduced variability in FRET measurements is particularly beneficial for
                    FRET-based biosensors, where the dynamic range is frequently 20% or less
                        [37]–[39]. Furthermore, once mCerulean3 is bleached in cells,
                    the fluorescence does not significantly change through reversible
                    photoswitching. Not only will this simplify interpretation for fluorescence
                    photobleaching experiments, but it also will enhance the utility of corrective
                    photobleaching algorithms [24], [40]. This is of particular importance considering we find
                    that the fraction of fluorescence loss that is reversible can vary greatly, even
                    in highly controlled sample bead preparations. Thus, mCerulean3 possesses
                    special advantages for quantitative live-cell imaging applications. Synthetic DNA oligonucleotides for cloning and mutagenesis were purchased from
                    Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). PCR products and products of
                    restriction digests were purified by gel electrophoresis and extraction using
                    the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Plasmid DNA was purified
                    from overnight cultures using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen).
                    Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) or New
                    England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Sequencing was used to confirm the complete cDNA

                    and transformation was performed using DNA prep kits from Qiagen (QIAprep Spin
                    Miniprep Kit, HiSpeed Plasmid Midi, Plasmid Midi, or Maxi kit). Mutants were introduced into H6mCerulean [5] contained in the pQE9-N1
                    bacterial expression plasmid [20] by PCR using the Quikchange mutagenesis kit (Agilent
                    Technologies, Wilmington, DE) together with the primers listed in Table S1.
                    Mutant plasmids were transformed into XL10-Gold Ultracompetent cells (Agilent
                    Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Even though
                    this strain contains the lacIq mutation, repression of protein
                    production was sufficiently leaky to enable observation of CFP fluorescence.
                    Transformed cells were plated on LB agar plates containing 100 µg/ml
                    ampicillin, and incubated overnight at 37°C. For screening, 4–15
                    colonies were transferred to a 25 mm filter (Nucleopore Track-Etch Membrane, GE
                    Healthcare, Carlsbad, CA). The filter was then placed colony side up on the
                    bottom of a sterile 60 mm cell culture dish and screened for brightness (filter
                    set ET436/20X exciter, T455LP beamsplitter, ET480-40m-2p (Chroma Technology
                    Corp., Bellows Falls, VT) using an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200M with a 1×,
                    0.025 NA objective lens. Dishes were heated to 50°C to improve contrast.
                    Typically, ∼100 colonies were initially screened for brightness and the 5
                    brightest colonies were selected for additional screening. Colonies were grown
                    in culture for 1 h at 37°C, and streaked on LB agar plates containing 100
                    µg/ml ampicillin. The following day, single colonies were transferred to a
                    single filter for comparison, and the brightest colony was selected and cultured
                    in 5 ml LB (100 µg/ml ampicillin) for DNA miniprep (QIAprep spin,
                    Qiagen). The Qiagen T5 expression system was used to generate proteins from modified pQE9
                    vectors described elsewhere [5], [20]. Mutant CFPs selected for additional characterization
                    were transformed into M15(pRep4) bacteria for protein production. Induction with
                    isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside, harvesting and lysis are described
                    elsewhere [5].
                    Recombinant proteins were purified using Ni+2 loaded 1 ml HiTrap
                    Chelating HP columns (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's
                    instructions. Protein concentration was determined using the Advanced Protein
                    Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and gel electrophoresis as described
                    previously [5]. H6mTurquoise was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of
                        H6SCFP3A using the T65S primers listed in Table S1.
                    Recombinant H6mVenus:mCerulean3 contains a 10 aa linker, and was
                    derived using the cloning strategy for the short linker FRET pairs as previously
                    described [5].
                    Production of H6Cerulean and H6mCerulean has also been
                    described [5],
                        [20]. For mammalian expression, novel fluorescent protein constructs were subcloned
                    from the pQE9 vector into the pEGFP-C1 using NheI and HindIII restriction sites.
                    N3 and N1 constructs were generated by PCR using previously described methods
                        [5]. To
                    generate subcellular localization fusion vectors used for experiments in Figure 4, the appropriate
                    cloning vector and an mEmerald fusion vector were digested, either sequentially
                    or doubly, with the appropriate enzymes and ligated together after gel
                    purification. Thus, to prepare mCerulean3 N-terminal fusions, the following
                    digests were performed: human non-muscle α-actinin, EcoRI and NotI (vector
                    source, Tom Keller, FSU); human cytochrome C oxidase subunit VIII, BamHI and
                    NotI (mitochondria, Clontech); human zyxin, BamHI and NotI (Clare
                    Waterman-Storer, NIH); rat α-1 connexin-43, EcoRI and BamHI (Matthias Falk,
                    Lehigh University); human H2B, BamHI and NotI (George Patterson, NIH);
                    N-terminal 81 aa of human β-1,4-galactosyltransferase, BamHI and NotI
                    (Golgi, Clontech); human microtubule-associated protein EB3, BamHI and NotI
                    (Lynne Cassimeris, Lehigh University); human vimentin, BamHI and NotI (Robert
                    Goldman, Northwestern University); human peroxisomal membrane protein 2, NotI
                    and AgeI (peroxisomes; OriGene); c-src, BamHI and NotI (chicken c-src tyrosine
                    kinase, Marilyn Resh, Sloan-Kettering Institute); lifeact, BamHI and NotI
                    (N-terminal 17 aa from S. cerevisiae Abp 140, IDT); VE-cadherin, BamHI and NotI
                    (human vascular epithelial cadherin, Andreea Trache, Texas A&M); fascin,
                    BamHI and NotI (human fascin, OriGene). To prepare mCerulean3 C-terminal
                    fusions, the following digests were performed: human β-actin, NheI and BglII
                    (Clontech); human α-tubulin, NheI and BglII (Clontech); human light chain
                    clathrin, NheI and BglII (George Patterson, NIH); human lamin B1, NheI and BglII
                    (George Patterson, NIH); mouse MAP4, NheI and BglII (mouse microtubule
                    associated protein 4, nucleotides 1918–3135, Richard Cyr, Penn State
                    University); mouse light chain 9 myosin, NheI and BglII (Patricia Wadsworth,
                    University of Massachusetts); human CDC-42, NheI and BglII (OriGene); PCNA, AgeI
                    and BspEI (David Gilbert, FSU); mouse CAF-1, NheI and BglII (Akash Gunjan, FSU);
                    human fibrillarin, AgeI and BspEI (Dimitry Chudakov, Russian Academy of
                    Sciences); human GTPase Rab5a, NheI and BglII (Vicky Allen, University of
                    Manchester). For FRET efficiency and lifetime microscopy experiments, the plasmid encoding the
                    mCerulean:mVenus fusion was provided by Dr. Steven Vogel (NIH) [41], and was
                    used to generate the mCerulean3:mVenus and mTurquoise:mVenus fusion proteins
                    described in Table 2 by
                    substituting the coding sequence for mCerulean with the cDNA for mCerulean3. The
                    mVenus:mCerulean construct used in Figure 6B is the short linker sensor previously described [20].
                    mVenus:mCerulean3 and mVenus:mTurquoise fusions were constructed using an
                    identical strategy. Absorption spectra were collected using a UV-mini absorbance spectrometer
                    (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD), and emission spectra were collected on QM-3
                    fluorometer (Photon Technology International, Birmingham, NJ). Molar extinction
                    coefficients were calculated as previously described [5]. Förster distances were
                    calculated as previously described [5] using QY, extinction
                    coefficients, and overlap integrals generated from freshly prepared mCerulean,
                    mTurquoise, mCerulean3, and mVenus proteins. The pKa for fluorescence was
                    measured and calculated also as described [20]. Renaturation assays were
                    performed by a previously described method [3]. For the initial comparative
                    QY measurements, optical densities at 425 nm were set to 0.05, and total
                    fluorescence was measured from 430 to 600 nm (425 nm excitation). Polarizers
                    were set at magic angle conditions to account for polarization bias. Final data
                    normalization was performed using a fluorescein solution as a reference standard
                    (QY = 0.95 in 0.1 M NaOH [42]; 425 nm excitation,
                    430–650 nm emitted light collection), using identical instrument
                    parameters for CFP specimens, including the expanded emission range.
                    Fluorescence lifetimes were obtained by TCSPC spectroscopy using a FluoTime 100
                    (PicoQuant Photonics, Westfield, MA). Data was acquired under magic angle
                    conditions using 440 nm excitation, and collection with a 475 nm long pass
                    filter. Time constants were obtained from a single component fit using FluoFit
                    software (PicoQuant). For bleaching measurements, HiTrap beads were labeled with fluorescent protein as
                    previously described [43], [44] and mounted in Prolong Gold (Invitrogen). Imaging was
                    performed using an AxioObserver microscope platform (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging,
                    Thornwood, NY). High-speed imaging of fluorescence decay under constant 455 nm
                    light-emitting diode illumination was performed using a water-cooled C9100-13
                    EM-CCD (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ) to capture 300 images. Illumination power
                    was measured at the objective lens prior to experimentation using a Newport
                    1918C power meter. Decay in fluorescence was quantified and fit to a single
                    exponential decay using Prism software (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA). The
                            t0.5 for the curve fit was reported.
                    Photoswitching measurements were performed using a water-cooled Hamamatsu C10600
                    Orca-R2 CCD, under 455 nm light-emitting diode illumination. Cyan fluorescence
                    for single color experiments was captured using a High Efficiency CFP filter set
                    (47HE, Zeiss). FRET images were obtained under cyan illumination (455 LED, BP
                    436/25 filter) and passed through a T455lp dichroic beamsplitter (Chroma). Cyan
                    and yellow fluorescence were simultaneously collected in a single image using an
                    Optical Insights Dual-view system (Photometrics Headquarters, Tucson, AZ) with a
                    CFP/YFP beamsplitter. Images were processed using ImageJ software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). For imaging experiments, cells were seeded on No 1.5 glass bottom dishes (Mat-Tek
                    Corp., Ashland, MA) prior to transfection. Prior to seeding, COS7 cells and
                    HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum
                    (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). Transfections were performed using
                    FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), and imaging was performed in
                    phenol-red free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). HeLa epithelial (CCL-2, ATCC, Manassas,
                    VA) and Grey fox lung fibroblast (CCL-168, ATCC) cells were grown in a
                    50∶50 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F12 with 12.5% Cosmic calf
                    serum (Thermo Fisher) and transfected with Effectene (Qiagen). For live cell
                    experiments, temperature was maintained at 37°C using a Zeiss incubation
                    system, or a Delta-T culture chamber (Bioptechs, Butler, PA) under a humidified
                    atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Mouse pituitary GHFT1 cells [45] for FLIM
                    experiments (Table 2,
                        Figure
                        S2) were maintained as monolayer cultures in DMEM containing
                    10% newborn calf serum. Plasmid DNA was introduced by electroporation as
                    described earlier [6]. The amount of DNA was kept constant for each
                    electroporation using empty vector DNA. Cells were then transferred to Nunc
                    Lab-TekII chambered coverglass (Thermo Fisher), and maintained in an incubator
                    overnight before imaging. The coverglass with attached cells was rinsed, and the
                    chambers filled with CO2-independent medium and placed on the
                    microscope stage. Imaging experiments in Figure
                        4 were performed with a Nikon TE-2000 inverted microscope equipped
                    with QuantaMax™ filters (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) and a Cascade II
                    camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ), or an IX71 microscope (Olympus America,
                    Center Valley, PA) equipped with BrightLine™ filters (Semrock, Rochester,
                    NY) and a Hamamatsu ImagEM™ camera. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was
                    conducted on a C1Si (Nikon) and an Olympus FV1000, both equipped with argon-ion
                    457 nm and 405-nm diode lasers and proprietary filter sets. Spinning disk
                    confocal microscopy was performed on an Olympus DSU-IX81 equipped with a Lumen
                    200 illuminator (Prior Scientific, Rockland, MA), a Hamamatsu 9100-12 EMCCD
                    camera, Semrock filters, and 10-position filter wheels driven by a Lambda 10-3
                    controller (Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA). In some cases, cell cultures
                    expressing CFP fusions were fixed before imaging in 2% paraformaldehyde
                    (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA 19440) and washed several times in
                    PBS containing 0.05 M glycine before mounting with a polyvinyl alcohol-based
                    medium. Morphological features in all fusion constructs were confirmed by
                    imaging fixed cell preparations on coverslips using a Nikon 80i upright
                    microscope and Omega ECFP filter set (XF144-2) coupled to a Hamamatsu Orca ER or
                    a Photometrics CoolSNAP™ HQ2 camera. Imaging experiments on COS7 cells in Figure 5 were performed using a 40×, 1.3 NA Plan-NeoFluar oil
                    objective (Zeiss), and illuminated with a 455 nm light emitting diode
                    illuminator filtered through a high efficiency CFP filter set (436/20 exciter,
                    T455LP beamsplitter, 480/40 emitter; Zeiss) and collected with a water-cooled
                    Hamamatsu C9100-13 EM CCD. Illumination intensity and collection speeds were
                    held constant across samples. Acceptor photobleaching measurements were performed using confocal microscopy.
                    Data was collected 25 frames post bleaching to minimize the impact of mVenus
                    photoconversion, (photoconverted mVenus was 0.17±0.09 at frame 1,
                    –0.01±0.06 at frame 25, n = 11). FRET Imaging
                    experiments on HEK293 cells in Figure 6 were performed using a 40×, 0.95 NA Plan-ApoChromat
                    objective (Zeiss) with CFP excitation and FRET image collection as described
                    above for the bead calibration. Fluorescence lifetime measurements were made using the phasor FLIM method
                    recently described [46]–[48]. Images were collected
                    using an Olympus IX71 epi-fluorescent microscope equipped with a U Plan S-APO
                    60× 1.2 NA water objective lens. The microscope was coupled to the
                    FastFLIM frequency domain system (ISS, Champaign, IL) and uses a 0.5 mW 448 nm
                    diode laser modulated at a fundamental frequency of 20 MHz for excitation of
                    mCerulean. The lifetime images were acquired using a 480/40 nm emission filter,
                    and a typical data acquisition time of ∼20 s resulted in photon counts
                    sufficient for high confidence determination of fluorescence lifetimes. Phasor
                    plots (Figure
                        S2) show the entire distribution of the mCerulean and mCerulean3
                    fluorescence lifetimes in the image. The phasor transformation does not assume
                    any fitting model for fluorescence lifetime decays, but rather expresses the
                    overall decay in each pixel in terms of the polar coordinates on a universal
                    semi-circle [49]. Once the lifetimes of the unquenched donors were
                    determined, the FRET efficiency (EFRET) was
                    calculated by the equation: where
                            τD is the lifetime of the donor in the
                    absence of the acceptor, and τDA is the lifetime
                    of the donor in the presence of the acceptor. The indicated statistical tests were performed using Prism software. Amino acid sequence alignment of CFPs. An alignment of the amino
                        acid sequences for CFPs created during optimization is shown with the
                        original mCerulean sequence and also the sequence of mTurquoise. Amino acid
                        substitutions are highlighted in red. By convention, the amino acid are
                        referred to by their position in WT Aequorea GFP, which excludes the Val
                        insertion at position 2. Thus, Thr65 is actually is the
                        sixty-sixth amino acid in the mCerulean sequence. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0017896.s001 (TIF) Fluorescence lifetime microscopy of mCerulean3. Fluorescence
                        lifetime images of mouse pituitary GHFT1 cells expressing mCerulean (left
                        panel), mCerulean3 (right panel). Images were obtained using the frequency
                        domain method. The bottom panels show polar plot analyses of the lifetime
                        distributions for each image using the first harmonic (20 MHz), calculated
                        by the method of Redford and Clegg [49]. The average lifetime
                        was determined for each region of interest (red squares) and the scale bars
                        indicate 10 µm. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0017896.s002 (TIF)
