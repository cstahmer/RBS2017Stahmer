       Although previous studies of horses have investigated their facial expressions in specific contexts, e.g. pain, until now there has been no methodology available that documents all the possible facial movements of the horse and provides a way to record all potential facial configurations. This is essential for an objective description of horse facial expressions across a range of contexts that reflect different emotional states. Facial Action Coding Systems (FACS) provide a systematic methodology of identifying and coding facial expressions on the basis of underlying facial musculature and muscle movement. FACS are anatomically based and document all possible facial movements rather than a configuration of movements associated with a particular situation. Consequently, FACS can be applied as a tool for a wide range of research questions. We developed FACS for the domestic horse (Equus caballus) through anatomical investigation of the underlying musculature and subsequent analysis of naturally occurring behaviour captured on high quality video. Discrete facial movements were identified and described in terms of the underlying muscle contractions, in correspondence with previous FACS systems. The reliability of others to be able to learn this system (EquiFACS) and consistently code behavioural sequences was high—and this included people with no previous experience of horses. A wide range of facial movements were identified, including many that are also seen in primates and other domestic animals (dogs and cats). EquiFACS provides a method that can now be used to document the facial movements associated with different social contexts and thus to address questions relevant to understanding social cognition and comparative psychology, as well as informing current veterinary and animal welfare practices.

Facial Action Coding Systems (FACS) provide a method of identifying and recording facial expressions based on the underlying facial (mimetic) musculature and muscle movement [1]. Here we present EquiFACS, a Facial Action Coding System for the domestic horse (Equus caballus). Until now, there has been no methodology available that documented all of the facial movements of the horse, allowing a record of all potential facial configurations. There are a number of studies that focus on the facial expressions of horses in one specific context, for example pain [2, 3]. However, EquiFACS provides a comprehensive list of all the facial movements that horses can produce, which can be used to document facial expressions across a wide range of contexts. FACS are objective coding systems for describing facial behaviour. The facial muscles (sometimes known as the mimetic muscles) are a subgroup of muscles innervated by CN7 (the facial nerve). They are characterised by their extensive connections to the superficial fascia and skin of the face, and consequently are responsible for observable changes in the skin (facial movements or expressions) [4]. FACS are frameworks where designated codes (Action Units or AUs) represent the contraction of a particular facial muscle (or set of muscles) and the resulting facial movements [1]. Action Descriptors (ADs) are also used for more general facial movements where the muscular basis either cannot be identified or is the result of a different muscle set (e.g. deep muscles). This creates a reliable system that people can be trained to use and that describes facial actions in a standardised way, avoiding subjective assessments of expression. This is particularly important as the recording and analysis of facial expressions can be subject to a large degree of observer bias and influenced by the perceived emotional context [5–7]. Consequently, frameworks that quantify behaviour and allow reliable, objective measurements are needed. The original FACS was developed for use in humans [1] and this framework has since been applied to a number of different primates and domestic animals (chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)[8], orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus)[9], rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta)[10], hylobatids (gibbons and siamangs)[11], dogs (Canis familiaris)[12] and cats (Felis catus)[13]. This methodology provides compatible systems that allow direct comparisons using identical techniques across species with a different facial morphology (e.g. [14]). EquiFACS is the first attempt to develop this system for an animal with laterally placed eyes and an elongated face. Horses belong to the order Perissodactyla, and within this they are one of nine species in the family Equus. By the end of the Pleistocene era (approx. 2.5 million – 12,000 years ago) wild horses (Equus ferus) roamed across Europe, Asia and North America, and it is estimated that the domestication of horses began around 5000 years ago [15]. However, by the middle of the twentieth century horses had become extinct in the wild, yet were thriving as a domestic species [16]. Domestication can dramatically influence the social, cognitive, and morphological characteristics of a species, and the study of domestic species is of great interest from both welfare and evolutionary perspectives [17–19]. Horses are long-lived social animals. Feral populations have demonstrated that without domestic pressures horses would live in a society comprising of several small groups or ‘bands’ that share space and resources, and to which membership stays relatively stable over time. Bands have large, overlapping ranges so horses regularly come into contact with many other conspecifics, and inter-band dominance indicates that within the larger herd established social relationships exist [20]. Consequently, horses show fission-fusion dynamics; a variation of the same complex social organisation that is seen in humans, bonobos, chimpanzees, and macaques, as well as elephants, spotted hyenas and many cetaceans [21]. Group life in these societies is determined by complex, long-term social relationships that must be maintained, suggesting effective communication would be adaptive [22]. Horses are predominantly visual animals, with reasonable visual acuity that, at 23 cycles per degree, is better than domestic cats and dogs [23–25]. While horses’ use of head and body posture in signaling has been described in observational literature (e.g. [20] and [26]), surprisingly their use of facial expressions has been largely overlooked. This is despite attempts to quantify facial expressions in horses’ close relatives, plains zebra (Equus quagga [27]), and reports that horses do routinely use some apparently complex facial expressions (e.g. snapping and the estrous face, which both involve pulling back the lips and flattening of the ears [28]). A systematic way of recording facial expressions would have a wide range of uses, with the potential to assess and improve welfare for horses, as well as enhancing our understanding of communication and cognition in this highly social species and providing insights into the effects of domestication. Questions about whether particular facial movements are associated with negative emotional states or indicative of positive experiences will be particularly important to address, and FACS provides an ideal framework for such investigations. More generally, FACS provides a framework through which species with different phylogenetic and ecological influences can be compared to investigate the functional significance and evolutionary origins of facial expressions. To modify FACS for use in non-human animals, the first step was to document and compare their facial anatomy [9–13, 29]. Horses are only distantly related to primates and the other animals FACS have previously been developed for; additionally horses have a dramatically different facial morphology to these animals, including laterally placed eyes, elongated faces, and raised zygomatic arches. Consequently, it is possible that the facial muscles of horses would show little similarity with the facial muscles of humans or those underpinning other FACS. To facilitate valid comparisons across taxa, it is necessary to report findings in a consistent way, with a standardised nomenclature for the facial muscles [4]. While the anatomy of domestic mammals is generally well documented, it has been difficult to make direct comparisons between domestic animals and primates because of the inconsistent terminology used (see [4, 30] for reviews and a call for a standardized nomenclature for the facial muscles). Additionally, the anatomy of domestic mammals tends to be described from a veterinary perspective, so that the muscles of facial expression are often not documented comprehensively within one text (e.g. [31]). Therefore, we supplemented the previous literature on the facial anatomy of the horse with our own dissection using an innovative ‘face mask’ method, which allows a more complete view of the facial muscles and their attachments than traditional dissection methods [32–35]. In doing this we documented the muscles using the recommended terms, which allowed us to make direct comparisons between horses and the other species. The facial muscles of the horse are reported here using the standardised terminology [4], so that a free, detailed record of the muscles of facial expression is available alongside the EquiFACS manual. We then analysed footage of a wide range of naturally occurring horse behaviours captured on high quality video. Discrete facial movements were identified, their proposed muscular basis was noted, and they were given a code in correspondence with previous FACS systems. All the facial movements identified are listed in the results, accompanied by a description of the appearance changes and video illustrations. Where necessary, the proposed muscular basis of the actions is given and there are also sections on subtle differences between similar actions. The head of one horse was acquired from the New Bolton Centre at the University of Pennsylvania. The dissection was done using an innovative ‘face mask’ method, where the facial musculature is removed from the deep muscles and the skull with the skin, creating a ‘facial mask’ that holds all of the facial muscles (see S1 Text for full details of the dissection procedure). Using this novel approach preserves the superficially located facial muscles that might be lost in the traditional dissection method of removing the skin from the facial musculature. Furthermore, it provides a more complete picture of muscle attachments, by keeping superficial portions attached to the skin and deeper portions attached to the skull (see [32–35]). The muscles were examined for presence/absence, attachments to the bone, skin, and cartilage, as well as their three-dimensional relationships to one another and to the skull. Muscles were classified with reference to a variety of sources (mainly [36, 37]) and in relation to previous dissections completed for the development of FACS in other species [32–35]. All muscles and their attachments were recorded, sketched and photographed. We collected and analysed 15 hours of video footage of a wide range of naturally occurring horse behaviours from a sample of 86 horses. Known ages ranged from 4 weeks to 27 years, and the sample included horses of different breeds, coat colours, and sex. Horses were videoed using a Canon XM2 video recorder in a variety of situations, including interacting with conspecifics, humans and other animals (e.g. dogs), feeding and mating. Each discrete facial movement identified was given a code (an Action unit—AU—or an Action Descriptor—AD) in correspondence with previous FACS systems. Where EquiFACS identified movements analogous to those in humans or other animals, the same codes have been used. In some cases, although the same muscle is used in both humans and horses the resulting action on the face is very different; in these cases the Action Unit is prefixed with an ‘H’ e.g. AUH13. In other cases, although the action on the face is similar in horses and humans, the underlying muscular basis differs; in these cases the AU is prefixed by a 1 (e.g. AU122). Where novel movements were noted a new Action Unit or Descriptor was created (see Table 1 and Table 2). Agreement on these classifications was reached between two trained human FACS coders (JW and BMW), a comparative anatomist (AMB), and a specialist in animal behaviour (including horses) (KM).

              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131738.t002 The reliability of others to be able to learn EquiFACS and consistently code behaviour was tested with four coders, three of whom had no previous experience of FACS and one of whom had no previous experience of horses. The coders were each given the text, video examples, and practical instructions describing how to use EquiFACS effectively (see S3 Text) and asked to learn EquiFACS independently. The coders had minimum contact with the authors in this time, so that their performance would be considered a fair test of whether EquiFACS produces reliable coding when learned without training from the developers. When each coder was happy that they understood the principles of EquiFACS and felt they could reliably identify the expressions, they were asked to code 22 short video clips (containing the full range of AUs and EADs) with the manual for reference. In accordance with previous FACS, reliability was measured using Wexler’s ratio [1, 8–12, 38]. Wexler’s ratio is a ratio of the number of agreements (i.e. the number of AUs on which coder 1 and coder 2 agreed x 2) divided by the number of possibilities for agreement (i.e. the total number of AUs scored by both coders). This is particularly suitable for situations, such as in FACS, where there are a large number of potential codes and there is likely to be a different number of items coded by each coder. Each person’s coding was compared to JW’s coding, the agreement ratio was calculated for each video clip, and then an average over the video clips was taken for each coder. The overall average was 0.86 (coder 1 = 0.85; coder 2 = 0.86; coder 3 = 0.87; coder 4 = 0.85), demonstrating high reliability across the coders. This study gained ethical approval from the University of Sussex Ethical Review Committee, and was carried out in accordance with the Association of Animal Behaviour Guidelines for the Treatment of Animals in Behavioural Research. All owners gave consent for their horses to be video recorded. It should be noted that the specimen for the dissection was not euthanised for the purpose of this study, but was acquired from a veterinary centre where the horse had been euthanised for clinical reasons. Fig 1 depicts the facial muscles of the horse (S1, S2, and S3 Figs show the facial muscles located in our dissection). Overall, the facial muscles of horses are very complex, and although there are differences, there are a surprising number of similarities with humans and other primates. Table 1 summarises the findings in comparison to the human facial muscles. Detailed descriptions of the muscles are given in S2 Text.  NB. Levator labii superioris a.n. represents the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, which is often also called the levator nasolabialis. Synonyms for the levator annuli oris fascialis muscle include the dilator nares muscle and the caninus muscle. The frontoscutularis has a frontal and a temporal arm. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131738.g001 Gross observations showed that the muscles around the ear, lips, and nose of the horse were particularly large and complex, with these muscles having many attachments to the fascia, cartilage, and other muscles (S2 and S3 Figs). In particular, many muscles of the lower face converged in the modiolus to form a large, complex muscular mass (S2 Figs). This was in contrast to previous suggestions that mammals distantly related to primates, such as Perissodactyla, should have very simple facial musculature, particularly around the lips and mid-face [39, 40]. The orbital and mid-face region of the horse had numerous muscles including both a zygomatic major and minor (also termed the malaris), and an extensive obicularis occuli, although the muscles in these areas were thinner than the muscles around the ears and lower face. There was a large amount of adipose compared to non-human primates, e.g. chimpanzee, [33]; rhesus macaques, [34] Otolemur [32] and Hylobatids [35], possibly due to the domestic situation of the horse. The adipose was particularly prevalent around the ear, but also found around the mouth (this has been cut away in the Figs to allow better observation of the muscles). The anatomy of the eye area is different in horses as compared to humans, other primates, and dogs (see Fig 2 for a visual representation of the key facial landmarks of the horse and Fig 3 for a guide to anatomical direction). Horses do not have the features, such as eyebrows or the prominent brow ridge, that are thought to accentuate brow movements in other animals. However, horses do have a facial action that raises skin above the inner corner of the eye. This is similar to the movement derived from the frontalis in humans (inner brow raiser—AU1), although in horses the action is underpinned by the levator anguli occuli medialis and the corrugator supercilii, making it analogous to the inner brow raiser seen in dogs and cats. Consequently, the code used to denote this movement in dogFACS and catFACS (AU101) is also used here.  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131738.g002  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131738.g003  The picture shows the left eye of the horse. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131738.g004 Horses have three eyelids: upper, lower, and third (nictitating membrane). However, the third eyelid is usually only barely visible at the inner corner of the eye. The eyes of the horse are placed more laterally than the eyes of primates and dogs (40 degrees) [41], with no prominent supercilliary arch or epicanthal fold. In horses, the orbicularis occuli muscle is mostly responsible for the actions of closing the eyes and blinking. This is in contrast to humans and other primates, who can close the eyes by relaxation of the levator palpebrae superioris alone. The eye closing action seen in horses more resembles that seen in dogs and cats, and the AUs given below correspond with the parallel actions in dogFACS and catFACS. AUs 143 and 145 both refer to closure of the eyes, although they are mutually exclusive and cannot be coded simultaneously. The main difference between these actions is the speed at which they occur, and the extent of recruitment of the orbicularis oculi. AU143 is substantially slower than AU145. Additionally, AU145 is seen in conjunction with higher degrees of actions that resemble AU6 (the cheek raiser) in humans (e.g. raising of the infraorbital region). However, AU6 and AU7 (lid tightener) are both omitted from EquiFACS. Both of these movements constrict the skin around the eye in primates, but are not reliably discernable as independent facial movements in horses. Horses do show some signs of AU6 within AU143 and 145 (contraction of the infraorbital region) and some contraction of the orbicularis occuli is seen that reduces the opening of the eye without closing it completely. However, these contractions are not reliably discernable as independent actions, and would be very difficult to distinguish, particularly in the field. For this reason, AU47 – the half blink, has been created, which covers all instances where the eye partially closes. EquiFACS omits AU46, which represents a wink in humans, as AU46 refers to an intentional action. The absence of AU46 from EquiFACS is to avoid subjective decisions about whether there is intentionality of expression in horses. AU 143 denotes eye closure that lasts for more than half a second. This movement results from the relaxation of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, and small actions of the orbicularis oculi. AU145 refers to a quick eye closure that involves both the relaxation of the upper eyelid and some contraction of the lid tightening muscles. Both the timing of the action and the appearance of the eyelids, particularly the lower eyelid, can differentiate it from AU143. This movement has not been observed in humans, so there is no corresponding AU. Interestingly there is a corresponding movement in cats however, and the same code, AU47, is also used here. AU5 pulls the upper eyelid back into the eye socket. In the usual eyes open position, the upper eyelid covers the eye to some extent and there is some contraction of the muscle that underlies AU5. However, AU5 denotes when the contraction goes beyond the usual, pulling the eyelid further back into the eye socket. In humans this action is very obvious, however in horses there is less of a prominent brow ridge and this action is more difficult to discern. The position of the eyelashes can be very helpful in determining the position of the eyelid. Horses do have white sclera around the eyes, although generally this is not visible at rest. In some situations, horses will display more of the white sclera due to a change in the opening of the eye or position of the eyeball. As this is not underpinned by a particular muscular basis, it has been labeled as an Action Descriptor, AD1. This is coded separate to AU5, as although there may be an increase in visible sclera with AU5 it is not a requirement for coding AU5. Additionally, AU5 represents widening eye opening, whereas movements of the eyeball unrelated to AU5 can also increase the visible white sclera. Consequently, AD1 and AU5 can both be scored independently, but also simultaneously. The amount of visible white sclera is associated with the expression of fear in many animals, including humans[42, 43]. Consequently, AD1 is an essential part of EquiFACS. However, depending on the degree of interest there are two levels of coding for this action. One code simply represents an increase in the amount of white sclera exposed. The second method (which is optional and may only be useful if there is a specific interest in this expression) allows a calculation of the percentage of eye-white visible (see S4 Text). It is necessary to establish a suitable baseline for coding these movements, as different horses will display varying amounts of white sclera at rest. It is also important to be wary of coding these movements alongside movements of the head or camera viewpoint, as these factors can also influence the amount of sclera visible


 The horse has an elaborate network of robust facial muscles in the lower face, with a complex innervation. This has some similarities with the facial musculature of humans, however horses also have a number of different specialisations (see Table 1). The movements of the lower face are complicated and often many actions are seen together in a rapid, fluid sequence.  Part A shows appearance changes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7; part B shows appearance changes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131738.g005 In primates, dogs, and cats, the zygomatic major muscle (often termed zygomaticus muscle in dogs and cats) muscle pulls the lip corners obliquely towards the cheekbone. Horses also have a zygomatic major muscle (generally termed the zygomaticus muscle) that pulls the lip corners back. However, this action has a slightly different appearance in horses due to their different facial morphology. This action resembles AU13, sharp lip puller, in humans, where the corners of the lips are pulled sharply up towards the upper jawbone. However, in horses a different muscle to that used in humans causes this movement. To account for this differing muscular basis, this action has been given the code 113.  The lips are in the neutral position. AU113 is very difficult to code from photographs unless there is a very strong action, or it is combined with AU12, lip corner puller. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131738.g006  Note the difference in the shape at the corner of the mouth. AU12 produces a curvature at the mouth corner; however, when AU113 is applied with AU12 the mouth has an angular appearance at the top corner, with corresponding wrinkles in the skin surrounding the mouth. See S15 Video for a demonstration of these actions acting simultaneously. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131738.g007 In humans the levator annuli oris fascialis muscle (also known as the caninus muscle or dilator naris lateralis muscle) acts on the upper lip and is responsible for AU13. However, in horses the levator annuli oris fascialis has no action on the upper lip. Instead, it draws back the caudal wing of the nostril. Consequently, although this movement has the same muscular basis in horses and humans, it is labeled AUH13 in EquiFACS to highlight the difference in action and appearance.  The picture on the left shows the neutral face, the picture on the right shows the face with a mild action of AUH13 applied. The arrow illustrates the location and direction of movement. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131738.g008 AU16 refers to the action of the lower lip being pulled down by the depressor labii inferioris muscle, as it does in primates. It must be visibly pulled down, rather than just relaxed. If the lower lip is hanging down due to relaxation, then code AD160, lower lip relax. The images, video, and descriptions deal with AUs 16+25, lips part. Usually, when there is an action of 16 the lips part and are scored as 16+25, 16+25+26, jaw drop, or 16+25+27, mouth stretch. As in chimpanzees, this action occurs from the relaxation of the lower lip and the lip is pulled down by its weight alone. See S22 Video for an example of this action.  Note that from a distance, although subtle, AD160 can be identified by the visible pink flesh from the inside of the lower lip. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131738.g009  Panel A demonstrates the outline of the lower lip when AD160 is present, and panel B when AD160 is released. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131738.g010 AU17 is underpinned by contraction of the mentalis muscle, which arises in the prominence of the mental region (also known as the chin) and inserts into the mental region. Consequently AU17 tightens the skin in the mental region and pushes the skin up towards the lower lip and nose. In combination AU16 + 17 the action of the depressor labii inferioris muscle (pulling down the lip) is mediated by the action of the mentalis muscle (pushing up the skin of the mental region). This causes a distinct appearance, where the lip can still be pulled down, but to a lesser extent than when AU16 is acting alone.  Note the square shape of the lip and definition in the skin covering the mental region in combination AU16+17. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131738.g011 AU 18 draws the lips medially, causing the lips to pucker and protrude. In humans this is generally seen in both lips, however in horses this action is mostly seen in the top lip only. AU122 resembles AU22, the Lip Funneler, which is seen in humans and chimpanzees. However, in horses this movement has a partially different muscular basis and involves the transverse nasi and levator labii superioris muscles in addition to the orbicularis oris muscle. In AU122 the lip is pushed forward and curls/flares. By definition this must part the lips, and so must always be scored with an AU25, lips part, and this action is usually only seen in the top lip.  These wrinkles are also characteristic of AU10, upper lip raiser, however in AU10 there is no puckering or eversion of the lip. 
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131738.g012 These three AUs describe mouth opening, including separation of the lips and the teeth. Although there could be an argument for classifying these as Action Descriptors rather than Action Units, we have described them as Action Units here to remain consistent with previous FACS. AU25 denotes separation of the lips, so can be coded independently or with AU26 or 27. AU26 and 27 both refer to parting of the jaw; and so can be coded with or without 25. However, AU26 and 27 are mutually exclusive as they designate different types of jaw opening, and so AU26 and 27 must not both be coded for the same movement. Although AU26 and 27 both code opening of the mouth, they refer to different actions. AU26 refers to the dropping of the lower jaw that is caused by relaxation of muscles. However, AU27 refers to a more purposeful movement where the jaw is stretched apart by contraction of muscles. Ear actions do not feature in many primate FACS, as the auricular (ear) muscles of many the primates are gracile and vestigial. Rhesus macaques are an exception where ear action descriptors have been described [8, 10], as they are for the domestic dog [12] and cat [13]. Horses have an extremely complex and robust set of auricular muscles that allow a great range and specificity of movement. However, the ears of horses are obvious and large, with little variation in the shape of the pinna (external ear), making it relatively easy to code ear movements. Often both of the ears are visible simultaneously, unlike the other movements described in EquiFACS where one side of the face is likely to be obscured. If one ear is out of sight it cannot be assumed that any action seen in the visible ear is bilateral. The ears can, and often do, move independently, and so it should be carefully noted if a movement is unilateral or if one ear is out of sight (AD 75). Action descriptors are given rather than specific action units, as due to the complex muscular network around the auricle it is impossible to know the exact basis of the ear movements. For this reason section A. Proposed Muscular Basis, is omitted from the descriptions below. Before coding ear movements in horses, a neutral position for each individual must be determined. This helps to distinguish between genuine ear movements and a release of a previous movement that is returning the ears to neutral. The ideal time to obtain sight of a neutral position is when the horse is resting (e.g. Fig 13).  
              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131738.g013  Note how the angle of the ears to the front of the face alters.

              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131738.g015 A variety of miscellaneous actions and supplementary codes are given in S5 Text. Whilst these do not describe facial movements, they denote actions that can influence the coding of facial expression. The study of complex behaviours, such as facial expressions, would be limited without standardised systems that allow quantification of behaviour and cross-species comparisons. Facial Action Coding Systems (FACS) provide a means of addressing this problem, and by developing a FACS for the domestic horse (EquiFACS) we have produced a tool that allows the systematic recording of horse facial expressions in any context, with the potential to make direct comparisons across species. EquiFACS is an anatomically based, objective system that contains all the facial actions horses can possibly produce, making it suitable for many different research questions. Horses have a rich facial repertoire, with 17 defined Action Units (AUs). Whilst this was less than the number of AUs humans display (27), it was slightly more than most other animals that FACS have been developed for (chimpanzees, 13, rhesus macaques, 13, orang-utans, 15, Hylobatids, 16, dogs, 16), with only cats displaying a larger facial repertoire (21, largely due to the extensive whisker and ear movements). The potential to make such cross species comparisons can enhance our understanding of the meaning, function, and evolution of communicative behaviour [14, 44]. In fact, many of the horse AUs were similar to the facial movements seen in other animals, including humans, chimpanzees, cats, and dogs. It was previously thought that humans possessed the most complex repertoire of facial expressions and that, in phylogenetic terms, the further away an animal was from humans, the more rudimentary their use of facial expressions would be. However, through the development of EquiFACS it is apparent that horses also have an extensive range of facial movements, sharing many Action Units with humans and other animals. This contributes to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the evolution of facial expressions was not driven entirely by phylogenetic pressures, but that other, socio-ecological factors had a significant influence [30, 35]. EquiFACS also provides those working in the horse community with a standardised language through which information can be shared, facilitating the investigation of questions relevant to horse management and welfare. It should be noted that whilst some of the video examples given with this manuscript contain recognisable horse behaviour (e.g. flehmen, S25 and S30 Videos), when coding facial expressions it is important not to try and immediately assess the overall behaviour, but instead to focus on describing the individual facial movements. One of the key actions seen in flehmen (AU122, the upper lip curl) has also been recorded in some pain expressions of the horse [45, 46], and yet is also seen in other, unrelated contexts (see S31 Video). A potential application of EquiFACS would be to establish whether there are particular configurations of facial movements displayed alongside the upper lip curl (AU122), which help distinguish the different contexts. While recent work has suggested that horses use apparently complex facial expressions [28, 47], and that certain facial movements are associated with pain in domestic horses [2, 3], until now the full capacity of horse facial expressions to convey a range of information has been largely overlooked. In particular, no studies have yet investigated whether there are facial expressions associated with positive experiences in horses–a critical yet poorly understood aspect of animal welfare [48]. EquiFACS can be applied to address this gap, with the potential to greatly facilitate future studies of horse welfare as well as extending our knowledge of equine communication and cognition.
