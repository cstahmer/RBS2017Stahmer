MR. DOOLEYâ€™S PHILOSOPHY
By Finley Peter Dunne
_Illustrated by_ F. OPPER.
{Illustration: POOR PEOPLE â€˜LL HAVE SIMPLE MEALS.}
_To the Hennessys of the world who suffer and are silent_
PREFACE
The reporter of these monologues would apologize for the frequent
reappearances of Mr. Dooley, if he felt the old gentleman would
appreciate an apology in his behalf. But Mr. Dooley has none of the
modesty that has been described as â€œan invention for protection against
NA
discovered this theory to excuse his own imperfect but boastful egotism,
he recognizes no such human failing as envy. Most of the papers in the
present collection of the sayings of this great and learned man have
appeared in the press of America and England. This will account for the
fact that they deal with subjects that have pressed hard upon the minds
of newspaper readers, statesmen, and tax-payers during the year.
To these utterances have been added a number of obiter dicta by the
philosopher, which, perhaps, will be found to have the reminiscent
flavor that appertains to the observations of all learned judges when
they are off the bench.
In some cases the sketches have been remodeled and care has been taken
to correct typographical blunders, except where they seemed to improve
the text. In this connection the writer must offer his profound
gratitude to the industrious typographer, who often makes two jokes grow
where only one grew before, and has added generously to the distress of
amateur elocutionists.

comes along Iâ€™m as quick as anny wan to say it isnâ€™t so bad, anâ€™ this

â€œâ€˜Tis â€˜Thâ€™ Biography iv a Hero be Wan who Knows.â€™ â€˜Tis â€˜Thâ€™ Darinâ€™
Exploits iv a Brave Man be an Actual Eye Witness.â€™ â€˜Tis â€˜Thâ€™ Account iv
thâ€™ Desthruction iv Spanish Power in thâ€™ Ant Hills,â€™ as it fell frâ€™m thâ€™
lips iv Tiddy Rosenfelt anâ€™ was took down be his own hands. Ye see â€˜twas
this way, Hinnissy, as I r-read thâ€™ book. Whin Tiddy was blowed up
in thâ€™ harbor iv Havana he instantly con-cluded they must be war.
He debated thâ€™ question long anâ€™ earnestly anâ€™ finâ€™lly passed a jint
resolution declarinâ€™ war. So far so good. But there was no wan to carry
it on. What shud he do? I will lave thâ€™ janial author tell thâ€™ story in
his own wurruds.
â€œâ€˜Thâ€™ sicrety iv war had offered me,â€™ he says, â€˜thâ€™ command of a
rigâ€™mint,â€™ he says, â€˜but I cud not consint to remain in Tampa while
perhaps less audacious heroes was at thâ€™ front,â€™ he says. â€˜Besides,â€™
he says, â€˜I felt I was incompetent fâ€™r to command a rigâ€™mint raised be
another,â€™ he says. â€˜I detarmined to raise wan iv me own,â€™ he says. â€˜I
selected frâ€™m me acquaintances in thâ€™ West,â€™ he says, â€˜men that had
thravelled with me acrost thâ€™ desert anâ€™ thâ€™ storm-wreathed mountain,â€™
he says, â€˜sharinâ€™ me burdens anâ€™ at times confrontinâ€™ perils almost as
gr-reat as anny that beset me path,â€™ he says. â€˜Together we had faced thâ€™
turrors iv thâ€™ large but vilent West,â€™ he says, â€˜anâ€™ these brave men
had seen me with me trusty rifle shootinâ€™ down thâ€™ buffalo, thâ€™ elk, thâ€™
moose, thâ€™ grizzly bear, thâ€™ mountain goat,â€™ he says, â€˜thâ€™ silver man,
anâ€™ other ferocious beasts iv thim parts,â€™ he says. â€˜Anâ€™ they niver
flinched,â€™ he says. â€˜In a few days I had thim perfectly tamed,â€™ he says,
â€˜anâ€™ ready to go annywhere I led,â€™ he says. â€˜On thâ€™ thransport goiâ€™n to
Cubia,â€™ he says, â€˜I wud stand beside wan iv these r-rough men threatinâ€™
him as a akel, which he was in ivrything but birth, education, rank
anâ€™ courage, anâ€™ together we wud look up at thâ€™ admirable stars iv that
tolerable southern sky anâ€™ quote thâ€™ bible frâ€™m Walt Whitman,â€™ he says.

Magazine}
â€œâ€˜We had no sooner landed in Cubia than it become nicessry fâ€™r me to
take command iv thâ€™ ar-rmy which I did at wanst. A number of days was
spint be me in reconnoitring, attinded onâ€™y be me brave anâ€™ fluent body
guard, Richard Harding Davis. I discovered that thâ€™ inimy was heavily
inthrenched on thâ€™ top iv San Juon hill immejiately in front iv me. At
this time it become apparent that I was handicapped be thâ€™ prisence iv
thâ€™ ar-rmy,â€™ he says. â€˜Wan day whin I was about to charge a block house
sturdily definded be an ar-rmy corps undher Ginâ€™ral Tamale, thâ€™ brave
Castile that I aftherwards killed with a small ink-eraser that I always
carry, I r-ran into thâ€™ entire military force iv thâ€™ United States lying
on its stomach. â€˜If ye wonâ€™t fight,â€™ says I, â€˜let me go through, â€˜I
says. â€˜Who ar-re ye?â€™ says they. â€˜Colonel Rosenfelt,â€™ says I. â€˜Oh,
excuse me,â€™ says the ginâ€™ral in command (if me mimry serves me thrue it
was Miles) r-risinâ€™ to his knees anâ€™ salutinâ€™. This showed me â€˜twud be
impossible fâ€™r to carry thâ€™ war to a successful con-clusion unless I
was free, so I sint thâ€™ ar-rmy home anâ€™ attackted San Juon hill. Ar-rmed
onâ€™y with a small thirty-two which I used in thâ€™ West to shoot thâ€™ fleet
prairie dog, I climbed that precipitous ascent in thâ€™ face iv thâ€™ most
gallinâ€™ fire I iver knew or heerd iv. But I had a few r-rounds iv gall
mesilf anâ€™ what cared I? I dashed madly on cheerinâ€™ as I wint. Thâ€™
Spanish throops was dhrawn up in a long line in thâ€™ formation known
among military men as a long line. I fired at thâ€™ man nearest to me anâ€™
I knew be thâ€™ expression iv his face that thâ€™ trusty bullet wint home.
It passed through his frame, he fell, anâ€™ wan little home in far-off
Catalonia was made happy be thâ€™ thought that their riprisintative had
been kilt be thâ€™ future governor iv New York. Thâ€™ bullet sped on its mad
flight anâ€™ passed through thâ€™ intire line finâ€™lly imbeddinâ€™ itself in
thâ€™ abdomen iv thâ€™ Ar-rch-bishop iv Santiago eight miles away. This
ended thâ€™ war.â€™
â€œâ€˜They has been some discussion as to who was thâ€™ first man to r-reach
thâ€™ summit iv San Juon hill. I will not attempt to dispute thâ€™ merits iv
thâ€™ manny gallant sojers, statesmen, corryspondints anâ€™ kinetoscope men
who claim thâ€™ distinction. They ar-re all brave men anâ€™ if they wish to
wear my laurels they may. I have so manny annyhow that it keeps me

Waldorf Asthor is a gintleman that wanst committed thâ€™ sin iv beinâ€™
bor-rn in this counthry. Ye know what orig-inal sin is, Hinnissy. Ye was
bor-rn with wan anâ€™ I was bor-rn with wan anâ€™ ivrybody was bor-rn with
wan. â€˜Twas took out iv me be Father Tuomy with holy wather first anâ€™
be me father aftherward with a sthrap. But I niver cud find out what it
was. Thâ€™ sins Iâ€™ve committed since, Iâ€™m sure iv. Theyâ€™re painted red anâ€™
carry a bell anâ€™ whin Iâ€™m awake in bed they stanâ€™ out on thâ€™ wall like
thâ€™ ilicthric signs they have down be State sthreet in front iv thâ€™
clothinâ€™ stores. But Iâ€™ll go to thâ€™ grave without knowinâ€™ exactly what
thâ€™ black orig-inal sin was I committed. All I know is I done wrong.
But with Willum Waldorf Asthor â€˜tis difâ€™rent. I say â€˜tis diffâ€™rent with
Willum Waldorf Asthor. His orig-inal sin was beinâ€™ bor-rn in New York.
He cuddenâ€™t do anything about it. Nawthinâ€™ in this counthry wud wipe
it out. He built a hotel intinded fâ€™r jooks who had no sins but thim
iv their own makinâ€™, but even thâ€™ sight iv their haughty bills cud not
efface thâ€™ stain. He thried to live down his crime without success anâ€™
he thried to live down to it be runninâ€™ fâ€™r congress, but it was no go.
No matther where he wint among his counthrymen in England some wan wud
find out he was bor-rn in New York anâ€™ thâ€™ man that ownded thâ€™ house
where he was spindinâ€™ thâ€™ night wud ast him if he was a cannibal anâ€™ had
he anny Indyan blood in his veins. â€˜Twas like seeinâ€™ a fine lookinâ€™
man with an intel-lecjal forehead anâ€™ handsome, dar-rk brown eyes anâ€™
admirinâ€™ him, anâ€™ thin larninâ€™ his name is Mudd J. Higgins. His accint
was proper anâ€™ his clothes didnâ€™t fit him right, but he was not bor-rn
in thâ€™ home iv his dayscindants, anâ€™ whin he walked thâ€™ sthreets iv
London he knew ivry polisman was sayinâ€™: â€˜There goes a man that pretinds

coort, â€˜Whatâ€™s ailinâ€™ yeâ€™?â€™ he says. â€˜Have ye committed some gr-reat
crime?â€™ he says. â€˜Partly,â€™ says Willum Waldorf Asthor. â€˜It was partly
me anâ€™ partly me folks,â€™ he says. â€˜I was,â€™ he says, in a voice broken be
tears, â€˜I was,â€™ he says, â€˜bor-rn in New York,â€™ he says. Thâ€™ clark made
thâ€™ sign iv thâ€™ cross anâ€™ says he: â€˜Ye shuddenâ€™t have come here,â€™ he
says. â€˜Poor afflicted wretch,â€™ he says, â€˜ye need a clargyman,â€™ he
says. â€˜Why did ye seek me out?â€™ he says. â€˜Because,â€™ says Willum Waldorf
Asthor, â€˜I wish,â€™ he says, â€˜fâ€™r to renounce me sinful life,â€™ he says. â€˜I
wish to be bor-rn anew,â€™ he says. Anâ€™ thâ€™ clark beinâ€™ a kind man helps
him out. Anâ€™ Willum Waldorf Asthor renounced fealty to all foreign
sovereigns, princes anâ€™ potentates anâ€™ especially Mack thâ€™ Wanst, or
Twict, iv thâ€™ United States anâ€™ Sulu anâ€™ all his wur-ruks anâ€™ he come
out iv thâ€™ coort with his hat cocked over his eye, with a step jaunty

thâ€™ Archbishop iv Canterbury r-runs thâ€™ ilivator, anâ€™ slug wan in thâ€™
printinâ€™ office is thâ€™ Impror iv Germany in disgeese. â€˜Tis a pa-per Iâ€™d
like to see. Iâ€™d like to know how thâ€™ Jook iv Marlbroâ€™d do thâ€™ McGovern

ye find it. Iâ€™d take money fâ€™rm England, much as I despise that formerly
haughty but now dejected land, if I cud get anny from there. Anâ€™ whin ye
come down to it, I dinnaw as I blame Willum Waldorf Asthor fâ€™r shiftinâ€™
his allegiance. Ivry wan to his taste as thâ€™ man said whin he dhrank out
iv thâ€™ fire extinguisher. It depinds on how ye feel. If ye ar-re a tired
la-ad anâ€™ wan without much fight in ye, livinâ€™ in this counthry is
like thryinâ€™ to read thâ€™ Lives iv the Saints at a meetinâ€™ iv thâ€™
Clan-na-Gael. Theyâ€™se no quiet fâ€™r annybody. Theyâ€™s a fight on ivry
minyit iv thâ€™ time. Ye may say to yeâ€™ersilf: â€˜Iâ€™ll lave these la-ads
roll each other as much as they plaze, but Iâ€™ll set here in thâ€™ shade
anâ€™ dhrink me milk punch, but ye canâ€™t do it. Some wan â€˜ll say, â€˜Look at
that gazabo settinâ€™ out there alone. Heâ€™s too proud fâ€™r to jine in our
simple dimmycratic festivities. Lave us go over anâ€™ bate him on thâ€™
eye.â€™ Anâ€™ they do it. Now if ye have fightinâ€™ blood in yeâ€™er veins ye
hastily gulp down yeer dhrink anâ€™ hand yeâ€™er assailant wan that does him
no kind iv good, anâ€™ thâ€™ first thing ye know yeâ€™re in th thick iv it anâ€™
its scrap, scrap, scrap till thâ€™ undhertaker calls fâ€™r to measure ye.
Anâ€™ â€˜tis tin to wan theyâ€™se somethinâ€™ doinâ€™ at thâ€™ funâ€™ral that yeâ€™re
sorry ye missed. Thatâ€™s life in America. Tis a gloryous big fight, a
rough anâ€™ tumble fight, a Donnybrook fair three thousanâ€™ miles wide anâ€™
a ruction in ivry block. Head anâ€™ banâ€™s anâ€™ feet anâ€™ thâ€™ pitchers on thâ€™
wall. No holds barred. Fight fair but donâ€™t fâ€™rget thâ€™ other la-ad may
not know where thâ€™ belt line is. No polisman in sight. A manâ€™s down with
twinty on top iv him wan minyit. Thâ€™ next heâ€™s settinâ€™ on thâ€™ pile usinâ€™
a base-ball bat on thâ€™ neighbor next below him. â€˜Come on, boys, fâ€™r
â€˜tis growinâ€™ late, anâ€™ no wanâ€™s been kilt yet. Glory be, but this is thâ€™
life!â€™
â€œNow, if Iâ€™m tired I donâ€™t want to fight. A man bats me in thâ€™ eye anâ€™
I call fâ€™r thâ€™ polis. They isnâ€™t a polisman in sight. I say to thâ€™
man that poked me: â€˜Sir, I fain wud sleep.â€™ â€˜Get up,â€™ he says, â€˜anâ€™ be
doinâ€™,â€™ he says. â€˜Life is rale, life is earnest,â€™ he says, â€˜anâ€™ man was
made to fight,â€™ he says, fetchinâ€™ me a kick. Anâ€™ if Iâ€™m tired I say,
â€˜Whatâ€™s thâ€™ use? Iâ€™ve got plenty iv money in me inside pocket. Iâ€™ll go
to a place where they donâ€™t know how to fight. Iâ€™ll go where I can get
something but an argymint fâ€™r me money anâ€™ where I wonâ€™t have to rassle
with thâ€™ man that bates me carpets, ayether,â€™ I says, â€˜fâ€™r fifty cints
overcharge or good govermint,â€™ I says. Anâ€™ I pike off to what Hogan
calls thâ€™ effete monarchies iv Europe anâ€™ no wan walks on me toes, anâ€™
ivry man I give a dollar to becomes an acrobat anâ€™ I live comfortably
anâ€™ die a markess! Thâ€™ divvle I do!

SERVANT GIRL PROBLEM
Whin Congress gets through expellinâ€™ mimbers that believes so much in
mathrimony that they carry it into ivry relation iv life anâ€™ opens thâ€™
dure iv Chiny so that an American can go in there as free as a Chinnyman
can come into this refuge iv thâ€™ opprissed iv thâ€™ wurruld, I hopeâ€™twill
turn its attintion to thâ€™ gr-reat question now confrontinâ€™ thâ€™

rule is ivry woman her own cook anâ€™ ivry man his own futman, anâ€™ be thâ€™
same token we have no poly-gamy problem anâ€™ no open dure problem anâ€™
no Phâ€™lippeen problem. Thâ€™ onâ€™y problem in Ar-rchey r-road is how manny
times does round steak go into twelve at wan dollar-an-a-half a day. But
east iv thâ€™ r-red bridge, Hinnissy, wan iv thâ€™ most cryinâ€™ issues iv
thâ€™ hour is: What shall we do with our hired help? Anâ€™ if Congress donâ€™t
NA
â€œâ€˜Tis an olâ€™ problem anâ€™ Iâ€™ve seen it arise anâ€™ shake its gory head
ivry few years whiniver thâ€™ Swede popylation got wurruk anâ€™ begun beinâ€™
marrid, thus rayjoocinâ€™ thâ€™ visible supply iv help. But it seems â€˜tis
deeper thin that. I see be letters in thâ€™ pa-apers that servants is
insolent, anâ€™ that they wonâ€™t go to wurruk onless they like thâ€™ looks iv
their employers, anâ€™ that they rayfuse to live in thâ€™ counthry. Why anny
servant shud rayfuse to live in thâ€™ counthry is more thin I can see.
Yeâ€™d think that this disreputable classâ€™d give annything to lave
thâ€™ crowded tinimints iv a large city where they have frinds be thâ€™
hundherds anâ€™ know thâ€™ polisman on thâ€™ bate anâ€™ can go out to hateful
dances anâ€™ moonlight picnics--yeâ€™d think these unforchnate slavesâ€™d be
delighted to live in Mulliganâ€™s subdivision, amid thâ€™ threes anâ€™ flowers
anâ€™ bur-rds. Gettinâ€™ up at four oâ€™clock in thâ€™ morninâ€™ thâ€™ singinâ€™
iv thâ€™ full-throated alarm clock is answered be an invisible choir iv
songsters, as Shakespere says, anâ€™ ye see thâ€™ sun rise over thâ€™ hills as
ye go out to carry in a ton iv coal. All day long ye meet no wan as
ye thrip over thâ€™ coal-scuttle, happy in yeâ€™er tile anâ€™ yeâ€™er heart is
enlivened be thâ€™ thought that thâ€™ childher in thâ€™ front iv thâ€™ house
ar-re growinâ€™ sthrong on thâ€™ fr-resh counthry air. Besides theyâ€™se
always cookinâ€™ to do. At night ye can set be thâ€™ fire anâ€™ improve yeâ€™er
mind be r-readinâ€™ half thâ€™ love story in thâ€™ part iv thâ€™ pa-aper that
thâ€™ cheese come home in, anâ€™ whin yeâ€™re through with that, all ye have
to do is to climb a ladder to thâ€™ roof anâ€™ fall through thâ€™ skylight anâ€™
NA
{Illustration}
â€œBut wud ye believe it, Hinnissy, manny iv these misguided women rayfuse
fâ€™r to take a job that aint in a city. They prefer thâ€™ bustle anâ€™
roar iv thâ€™ busy marts iv thrade, thâ€™ sthreet car, thâ€™ saloon on three
corners anâ€™ thâ€™ church on wan, thâ€™ pa-apers ivry morninâ€™ with pitchers
iv thâ€™ sâ€™ciety favâ€™rite thatâ€™s just thrown up a good job at Armours to
elope with thâ€™ well-known club man who used to be yard-masther iv thâ€™
three Bâ€™s, G, L, & N., thâ€™ shy peek into thâ€™ dhry-goods store, anâ€™ other
base luxuries, to a free anâ€™ healthy life in thâ€™ counthry between iliven
P.M. anâ€™ four A.M. Wensdahs anâ€™ Sundahs. â€˜Tis worse thin that, Hinnissy,
fâ€™r whin they ar-re in thâ€™ city they seem to dislike their wurruk anâ€™
manny iv thim ar-re givinâ€™ up splindid jobs with good large families
where they have no chanst to spind their salaries, if they dhraw thim,
anâ€™ takinâ€™ places in shops, anâ€™ gettinâ€™ marrid anâ€™ adoptinâ€™ other
devices that will give thim thâ€™ chanst fâ€™r to wear out their good
clothes. â€˜Tis a horrible situation. Riley thâ€™ conthractor dhropped in
here thâ€™ other day in his horse anâ€™ buggy on his way to the dhrainage
canal anâ€™ he was all wurruked up over thâ€™ question. â€˜Why,â€™ he says,
â€˜â€™tis scandâ€™lous thâ€™ way servants act,â€™ he says. â€˜Mrs. Riley has
hystrics,â€™ he says. â€˜Anâ€™ ivry two or three nights whin I come home,â€™ he
says, â€˜I have to win a fight againâ€™ a cook with a stove lid befure I
can move me family off thâ€™ fr-ront stoop,â€™ he says. â€˜We threat thim well
too,â€™ he says. â€˜I gave thâ€™ lasâ€™ wan we had fifty cints anâ€™ a cook book
at Chrisâ€™mas anâ€™ thâ€™ next day she left befure breakfast,â€™ he says. â€˜What
naytionalties do ye hire?â€™ says I. â€˜Iâ€™ve thried thim all,â€™ he says,
â€˜anâ€™,â€™ he says, â€˜Iâ€™ll say this in shame,â€™ he says, â€˜that thâ€™ Irish ar-re
thâ€™ worst,â€™ he says. â€˜Well,â€™ says I, â€˜ye need have no shame,â€™ I says,
â€˜fâ€™râ€™tis onâ€™y thâ€™ people that ar-re good servants thatâ€™ll niver be
masthers,â€™ I says. â€˜Thâ€™ Irish ar-re no good as servants because they
ar-re too good,â€™ I says. â€˜Thâ€™ Dutch ar-re no good because they aint good
enough. No matther how they start they get thâ€™ noodle habit. I had wan,
wanst, anâ€™ she got so she put noodles in me tay,â€™ I says. â€˜Thâ€™ Swedes
ar-re all right but they always get marrid thâ€™ sicond day. Yeâ€™ll have a
polisman at thâ€™ dure with a warrant fâ€™r thâ€™ arrist iv yeâ€™er cook if ye
hire a Boheemyan,â€™ I says. â€˜Coonsâ€™d be all right but theyâ€™re liable fâ€™r
to hand ye yeâ€™er food in ragtime, anâ€™ if ye ordher pork-chops fâ€™r dinner
anâ€™ thâ€™ hall is long, â€™tis little yeâ€™ll have to eat whin thâ€™ platterâ€™s
set down,â€™ I says. â€˜No,â€™ says I, â€˜theyâ€™se no naytionality now livinâ€™ in
this counthry thatâ€™re nathral bor-rn servants,â€™ I says. â€˜If ye want
to save throuble,â€™ I says, â€˜yeâ€™ll import yeâ€™er help. Theyâ€™se a race
iv people livinâ€™ in Cinthral Africa thatâ€™d be jusâ€™ r-right. They niver
sleep, tkey can carry twice their weight on their backs, they have no
frinds, they wear no clothes, they canâ€™t read, they canâ€™t dance anâ€™
they donâ€™t dhrink. Thâ€™ fact is theyâ€™re thoroughly oneddycated. If ye
cud tache thim to cook anâ€™ take care iv childher theyâ€™d be thâ€™ best
servants,â€™ says I. â€˜Anâ€™ what dâ€™ye call thim?â€™ says he. â€˜I fâ€™rget,â€™ says

â€œHe was a gintlemanâ€™s man in thâ€™ olâ€™ counthry anâ€™ I used to know his

frâ€™m experyence. Anâ€™ mebbe thatâ€™s thâ€™ throuble. Weâ€™re always harder with
our own kind thin with others. â€˜Tis I thatâ€™d be thâ€™ fine cinsor iv a
bartinderâ€™s wurruk. Thâ€™ more ye ought to be a servant yeâ€™ersilf thâ€™ more
difficultâ€™tis fâ€™r ye to get along with servants. I can holler to anny

anâ€™ holler at him, â€˜tis twinty to wan if he tur-rns r-round heâ€™ll hit me
in thâ€™ eye. We have a servant girl problem because, Hinnissy, it isnâ€™t
manny years since we first begun to have servant girls. But I hope
Congressâ€™ll take it up. A smart Congress like thâ€™ wan we have now ought
to be able to spare a little time frâ€™m its preparation iv new Jims iv

not so much diffâ€™rence between war now anâ€™ war whin I was a kid, as they

Thâ€™ heart iv thâ€™ corryspondint is made sick be thâ€™ sight, anâ€™ be thâ€™

in thâ€™ shell that removes a weak back; if his head throubles him, he can

him in vilet powdher. They have guns that anny boy or girl who knows thâ€™

â€˜In thâ€™ reign iv Bildad thâ€™ first,â€™ says he--he was a larned man, was

up between thim that whichiver won at thâ€™ iliction shud commind anâ€™
congratulate, anâ€™ thim that lost shud denounce anâ€™ deplore. Anâ€™ so itâ€™s

Hinnissy, iv mimbers iv thâ€™ Bar. He says: â€˜Ye keep that cup on yeâ€™er
mantle-piece anâ€™ if eâ€™er an Englishman wants it, donâ€™t ye give it to

cup, an â€˜twas lave go altogether, anâ€™ thâ€™ lasâ€™ man to thâ€™ line knows
what he is. Heâ€™s an Englishman, iv coorse. That was all r-right too. But
thâ€™ time come whin thâ€™ lagal pro-fission took a hand in thâ€™ game. â€˜Look

holds a meetinâ€™ iv his childher to bid thim good-by anâ€™ r-runs to hide

â€œA Mormon, Hinnissy, is a man that has thâ€™ bad taste anâ€™ thâ€™ rellijion

MARRIAGE AND POLITICS

â€œWell, â€˜tis little he knows about it. A man in pollytics has got to be
marrid. If he ainâ€™t marrid whereâ€™ll he go fâ€™r another kind iv throuble?
Anâ€™ whereâ€™ll he find people to support? An unmarrid man donâ€™t get along
in pollytics because he donâ€™t need thâ€™ money. Whin heâ€™s in thâ€™ middle iv
a primâ€™ry, with maybe twinty or thirty iv thâ€™ opposite party on top
iv him, thinks he to himsilf: â€˜Whatâ€™s thâ€™ good iv fightinâ€™ fâ€™r a job?
Theyâ€™se no wan depindant on me fâ€™r support,â€™ anâ€™ he surrinders. But a
marrid man says: â€˜Whatâ€™ll happen to me wife anâ€™ twelve small childher if
I donâ€™t win out here today?â€™ anâ€™ he bites his way to thâ€™ top iv thâ€™ pile
anâ€™ breaks open thâ€™ ballot box fâ€™r home and fireside. Thatâ€™s thâ€™ thruth
iv it, Hinnissy. Yeâ€™ll find all thâ€™ big jobs held be marrid men anâ€™ all
NA
â€œThâ€™ reason thâ€™ New York jood thinks marrid men oughtnâ€™t to be in
pollytics is because he thinks pollytics is spoort. Anâ€™ so it is. But
it ainâ€™t amachoor spoort, Hinnissy. They donâ€™t give ye a pewter mug with
yeâ€™er name on it fâ€™r takinâ€™ a chanst on beinâ€™ kilt. â€˜Tis a profissional
spoort, like playinâ€™ base-ball fâ€™r a livinâ€™ or wheelinâ€™ a thruck. Ye
niver see an amachoor at annything that was as good as a profissional.
Thâ€™ best amachoor ball team is beat be a bad profissional team; a
profissional boxer that thrains on bock beer anâ€™ Swiss cheese can lam
the head off a goold medal amachoor champeen thatâ€™s been atinâ€™ moldy
bread anâ€™ dhrinkinâ€™ wather fâ€™r six months, anâ€™ thâ€™ Dago that blows thâ€™
cornet on thâ€™ sthreet fâ€™r what annywan â€˜ll throw him can cut the figure
eight around Dinnis Finn, thatâ€™s been takinâ€™ lessons fâ€™r twinty year.
No, sir, pollytics ainâ€™t dhroppinâ€™ into tea, anâ€™ it ainâ€™t wurrukinâ€™ a
scroll saw, or makinâ€™ a garden in a back yard. â€˜Tis gettinâ€™ up at six
oâ€™clock in thâ€™ morninâ€™ anâ€™ r-rushinâ€™ off to wurruk, anâ€™ cominâ€™ home at
NA
â€œSo a manâ€™s got to be marrid to do it well. Heâ€™s got to have a wife at
home to make him oncomfortable if he comes in dhrunk, heâ€™s got to
have little prattlinâ€™ childher that he canâ€™t sind to thâ€™ Young Ladiesâ€™
academy onless he stuffs a ballotbox properly, anâ€™ heâ€™s got to have a
sthrong desire fâ€™r to live in thâ€™ avâ€™noo anâ€™ be seen dhrivinâ€™ downtown
in an open carredge with his wife settinâ€™ beside him undher a r-red
parasol. If he hasnâ€™t these things he wonâ€™t succeed in pollytics--or
packinâ€™ pork. Ye niver see a big man in pollytics that dhrank hard,
did ye? Ye never will. Anâ€™ thatâ€™s because theyâ€™re all marrid. Thâ€™
NA
â€œThâ€™ most domestic men in thâ€™ wurruld ar-re politicians, anâ€™ they always
marry early. Anâ€™ thatâ€™s thâ€™ sad part iv it, Hinnissy. A pollytician
always marries above his own station. Thatâ€™s wan sign that heâ€™ll be a
successful pollytician. Thâ€™ throuble is, thâ€™ good woman stays planted
just where she was, anâ€™ he goes by like a fast thrain by a whistlinâ€™
station. Dâ€™ye mind Oâ€™Leary, him thatâ€™s a retired capitalist now, him
that was aldherman, anâ€™ dhrainage thrustee, anâ€™ state sinitor fâ€™r wan
term? Well, whin I first knew Oâ€™Leary he wurruked down on a railroad
section tampinâ€™ thâ€™ thrack at wan-fifty a day. He was a sthrong, willinâ€™
young fellow, with a stiff right-hand punch anâ€™ a schaminâ€™ brain,
anâ€™ anny wan cud see that he was intinded to go to thâ€™ fr-ront. Thâ€™
aristocracy iv thâ€™ camp was Mrs. Cassidy, thâ€™ widdy lady that kept thâ€™
boordinâ€™-house. Aristocracy, Hinnissy, is like rale estate, a matther
iv location. Iâ€™m aristocracy to thâ€™ poor Oâ€™Briens back in thâ€™ alley, thâ€™
brewery agentâ€™s aristocracy to me, his boss is aristocracy to him, anâ€™
so it goes, up to the czar of Rooshia. Heâ€™s thâ€™ pick iv thâ€™ bunch, thâ€™
high man iv all, thâ€™ Pope not goinâ€™ in society. Well, Mrs. Cassidy was
aristocracy to Oâ€™Leary. He niver see such a stylish woman as she was
whin she turned out iv a Sundah afthernoon in her horse anâ€™ buggy. Heâ€™d
think to himsilf, â€˜If I iver can win that Iâ€™m settled fâ€™r life,â€™ anâ€™ iv
coorse he did. â€˜Twas a granâ€™ weddinâ€™; manny iv thâ€™ guests didnâ€™t show up
NA
â€œOâ€™Leary done well, anâ€™ she was a good wife to him. She made money anâ€™
kept him sthraight anâ€™ started him for constable. He won out, beinâ€™ a
sthrong man. Thin she got him to r-run fâ€™r aldher-man, anâ€™ ye shudâ€™ve
seen her thâ€™ night he was inaugurated! Be hivins, Hinnissy, she looked
like a fire in a pawnshop, fair covered with dimons anâ€™ goold watches
anâ€™ chains. She was cut out to be an aldhermanâ€™s wife, and it was worth
goinâ€™ miles to watch her leadinâ€™ thâ€™ granâ€™ march at thâ€™ Ar-rchy Road
NA
â€œBut there she stopped. A good woman anâ€™ a kind wan, she cuddenâ€™t go
thâ€™ distance. She had thâ€™ house anâ€™ thâ€™ childher to care fâ€™r anâ€™ her
eddy-cation was through with. They isnâ€™t much a woman can learn afther
she begins to raise a famâ€™ly. But with Oâ€™Leary â€˜twas diffrent. I say
â€˜twas diffâ€™rent with Oâ€™Leary. Ye talk about yeâ€™er colleges, Hinnissy,
but pollytics is thâ€™ poor manâ€™s college. A la-ad without enough book
larninâ€™ to r-read a meal-ticket, if ye give him tin years iv polly-tical
life, has thâ€™ air iv a statesman anâ€™ thâ€™ manner iv a jook, anâ€™ cud take
anny job frâ€™m dalinâ€™ faro bank to r-runnin thâ€™ threasury iv thâ€™
United States. His business brings him up againâ€™ thâ€™ best men iv thâ€™
com-munity, anâ€™ their customs anâ€™ ways iv speakinâ€™ anâ€™ thinkinâ€™ an
robbinâ€™ sticks to him. Thâ€™ good woman is at home all day. Thâ€™ onâ€™y
people she sees is thâ€™ childher anâ€™ thâ€™ neighbors. While thâ€™ good man in
a swallow-tail coat is addhressinâ€™ thâ€™ Commercial club on what we shud
do fâ€™r to reform pollytics, sheâ€™s discussinâ€™ thâ€™ price iv groceries with
thâ€™ plumberâ€™s wife anâ€™ talkinâ€™ over thâ€™ back fince to the milkman. Thin
Oâ€™Leary moves up on thâ€™ boolyvard. He knows heâ€™ll get along all r-right
on thâ€™ boolyvard. Thâ€™ menâ€™ll say: â€˜Theyâ€™se a good deal of rugged common
sinse in that Oâ€™Leary. He may be a robber, but theyâ€™s mighty little that
escapes him.â€™ But no wan speaks to Mrs. Oâ€™Leary. No wan asts her opinion
about our foreign policy. She sets day in anâ€™ day out behind thâ€™ dhrawn
curtains iv her three-story brownstone risidence prayinâ€™ that somewanâ€™ll
come in anâ€™ see her, an if annywan comes sheâ€™s frozen with fear. Anâ€™
â€˜tis onâ€™y whin she slips out to Ar-rchey r-road anâ€™ finds thâ€™ plumberâ€™s
wife, anâ€™ sets in thâ€™ kitchen over a cup iv tay, that peace comes to
her. By anâ€™ by they offer Oâ€™Leary thâ€™ nommynation fâ€™r congress. He knows
heâ€™s fit for it. Heâ€™s sthronger thin thâ€™ young lawyer they have now.
Peopleâ€™ll listen to him in Washâ€™nton as they do in Chicago. He says:
â€˜Iâ€™ll take it.â€™ Anâ€™ thin he thinks iv thâ€™ wife anâ€™ theyâ€™s no Washâ€™nton
fâ€™r him. His pollytical career is over. He wud niver have been constable
if he hadnâ€™t marrid, but he might have been sinitor if he was a

thâ€™ la-ad had something he wanted to get through that wud protect thâ€™

â€œThin Jawn took thâ€™ thrain anâ€™ begun confidinâ€™ his secret to a few

porther, anâ€™ thâ€™ candy butcher; he handed it to a switchman that got on
thâ€™ platform at South Bend, anâ€™ he stopped off at Detroit long enough
to tell about it to the deepoâ€™ policeman. He had a sign painted with thâ€™
tip on it anâ€™ hung it out thâ€™ window, anâ€™ he found a man that carrid a
thrombone in a band goinâ€™ over to Buffalo, anâ€™ he had him set thâ€™ good

he stopped at the Waldorf Asthoria, anâ€™ while thâ€™ barber was powdhrinâ€™
his face with grounâ€™ dimons Jawn tolâ€™ him to take thâ€™ money he was goinâ€™
to buy a policy ticket with anâ€™ get in on thâ€™ good thing. He tolâ€™ thâ€™
bootblack, thâ€™ waiter, thâ€™ man at thâ€™ news-stand, thâ€™ clerk behind thâ€™

show with pitchers iv a widow-an-orphan befure anâ€™ afther wirinâ€™, anâ€™ he
put an advertisement in all thâ€™ pa-apers tellinâ€™ how his stock wud make
weak men sthrong. He had thâ€™ tip sarved hot in all thâ€™ resthrants in
Wall sthrcet, anâ€™ told it confidintially to an open-air meetinâ€™ in
Madison Square. â€˜Theyâ€™se nawthin,â€™ he says, â€˜that does a tip so much
good as to give it circulation,â€™ he says. â€˜I think, be this time,â€™ he
says, â€˜all me frinds knows how to proceed, but--Great Hivins!â€™ he says.
â€˜What have I done? Whin all the poor people go to get thâ€™ stock they
wonâ€™t be anny fâ€™r thim. I can not lave thim thus in thâ€™ lurch. Me

â€˜Rather than see these brave people starvinâ€™ at thâ€™ dure fâ€™r a morsel iv

done it. He done it, Hinnissy, with unfalthrinâ€™ courage anâ€™ a clear

raysonable price, he wrote a confidintial note to thâ€™ pa-apers tellinâ€™

â€œWithout a wur-rud or a bow both gintlemen dhrew on each other anâ€™

antagonists was in perfect form anâ€™ well sustained thâ€™ reputation iv thâ€™

forchâ€™nate. He caught Major Bullseye anâ€™ Captain Wiggins, but Ginâ€™ral
Rangefinder was safe behind a barberâ€™s pole anâ€™ Colonel Chivvy fluttered
out iv range. Thus thâ€™ scoor was tin to six at thâ€™ conclusion iv thâ€™

was onable fâ€™r to reap thâ€™ reward iv his excellent marksmanship, fâ€™r in
a vain indeavor fâ€™r a large scoor, he chased thâ€™ barber iv thâ€™ sicond

he was a dayscinded frâ€™m thâ€™ kings iv Connock, though Cassidy was what
ye call a prolotoorio or a talkinâ€™ workinâ€™man. Anâ€™ thâ€™ wan king he hated
above all others was thâ€™ king iv Scholizwig-Holstein, which was thâ€™
barbarous counthry he come frâ€™m. He cud talk fairly dacint about other
kings, but this wan--Ludwig was his name anâ€™ I seen his pitcher in

happened to Ludwig. If they was a sthrike he charged it to Ludwig.
If Schwartzmeister didnâ€™t pay him fâ€™r half-solinâ€™ a pair iv Congress

cuddenâ€™t live on his fees anâ€™ he quit thâ€™ law anâ€™ wint into journalism.
He r-run â€˜Thâ€™ Colored Supplimint,â€™ but it was a failure, thâ€™ taste iv
thâ€™ public laninâ€™ more to quadhroon publications, anâ€™ no man that owned
a resthrant or theaytre or dhrygoods storeâ€™d put in an adver-tisemint

that without committinâ€™ burglary. He started to take up subscriptions

_The_ AMERICAN STAGE

â€œWhin I was a young man anâ€™ Crosbyâ€™s Opry house was r-runninâ€™ I used to
go down wanst in a while anâ€™ see Jawn Dillon throwinâ€™ things around fâ€™r
thâ€™ amusemint iv thâ€™ popylace anâ€™ whin Shakespere was played I often
had a seat in thâ€™ galâ€™ry, not because I liked thâ€™ actinâ€™, dâ€™ye mind, but
because Iâ€™d heerd me frind Hogan speak iv Shakespere. He was a good man,
that Shakespere, but his pieces is full iv thâ€™ olâ€™ gags that I heerd
whin I was a boy. Thâ€™ throuble with me about goinâ€™ to plays is that
no matther where I set I cud see some hired man in his shirt sleeves
argyinâ€™ with wan iv his frinds about a dog fight while Romeo was makinâ€™
thâ€™ kind iv love ye wuddent want yeâ€™er daughter to hear to Juliet in thâ€™
little bur-rd cage they calls a balcony. It mustâ€™ve been because I wanst
knowed a man be thâ€™ name iv Gallagher that was a scene painter that I
cud niver get mesilf to thâ€™ pint iv concedinâ€™ that thâ€™ mountains that
other people agreed was manny miles in thâ€™ distance was in no danger
iv beinâ€™ rubbed off thâ€™ map be thâ€™ coat-tails iv wan iv thâ€™ principal
char-ackters. Anâ€™ I always had me watch out to time thâ€™ moon whinâ€™ twas
shoved acrost thâ€™ sky anâ€™ thâ€™ record breakinâ€™ iv day in thâ€™ robbersâ€™
cave where thâ€™ robbers donâ€™t dare fâ€™r to shtep on the rock fâ€™r fear
theyâ€™ll stave it in. If day iver broke on thâ€™ level thâ€™ way it does on
thâ€™ stage â€˜twud tear thâ€™ bastinâ€™ threads out iv what Hogan calls thâ€™
firmymint. Hogan says I havenâ€™t got thâ€™ dhramatic delusion anâ€™ he must
be r-right fâ€™r ye canâ€™t make me believe that twinty years has elapsed
whin I know that Iâ€™ve onâ€™y had time to pass thâ€™ time iv day with thâ€™
bartinder nexâ€™ dure.
â€œPlays is upside down, Hinnissy, anâ€™ inside out. They begin with a full
statement iv whatâ€™s goinâ€™ to happen anâ€™ how itâ€™s goinâ€™ to come out
anâ€™ thin yeâ€™re asked to forget what ye heerd anâ€™ be surprised be thâ€™
outcome. I always feel like goinâ€™ to thâ€™ office anâ€™ gettinâ€™ me money or
me lithograph pass back afther thâ€™ first act.
â€œThâ€™ way to write a play is fâ€™r to take a book anâ€™ write it over hindend
foremost. Theyâ€™re puttinâ€™ all books on thâ€™ stage nowadays. Foxâ€™s
â€˜Book iv Martyrsâ€™ has been done into a three-act farce-comedy anâ€™ll be
projooced be Delia Fox, thâ€™ author, nexâ€™ summer. Websterâ€™s â€˜Onabridge
Ditchnryâ€™ will be brought out as a society dhrama with eight hundherd
thousanâ€™ char-ackters. Thâ€™ â€˜Constitution iv thâ€™ United Statesâ€™ (a farce)
be Willum McKinley is r-runninâ€™ to packed houses with thâ€™ cillybrated
thradeejan Aggynaldoo as thâ€™ villain. In thâ€™ sixteenth scene iv thâ€™ last
act theyâ€™se a naygur lynchinâ€™. James H. Wilson, thâ€™ author iv â€˜Silo anâ€™
Ensilage, a story fâ€™r boys,â€™ is dhramatizinâ€™ his cillybrated wurruk anâ€™
will follow it with a dhramatic version iv â€˜Sugar Beet Culture,â€™ a farm
play. â€˜Thâ€™ Familiar Lies iv Li Hung Changâ€™ is expicted to do well in thâ€™
provinces anâ€™ Hostetterâ€™s Almanac has all dates filled, I undherstand
thâ€™ bibleâ€™ll be r-ready fâ€™r thâ€™ stage undher thâ€™direction iv Einstein
anâ€™ Opperman befure thâ€™ first iv thâ€™ year. Some changes has been
nicissâ€™ry fâ€™r to adapt it to stage purposes, I see be thâ€™ pa-apers. Thâ€™
authors has become convinced that Adam anâ€™ Eve must be carrid through
thâ€™ whole play, so they have considerably lessened thâ€™ time between thâ€™
creation anâ€™ thâ€™ flood anâ€™ have made Adam an English nobleman with a
shady past anâ€™ thâ€™ Divvle a Fr-rinch count in love with Eve. Theyâ€™re

â€˜twas thâ€™ purpose iv thâ€™ hero to save thâ€™ honest girl from the clutches
iv thâ€™ villin in time to go out with him anâ€™ have a shell iv beer at
thâ€™ Dutchmanâ€™s downstairs. In thâ€™ plays nowadays thâ€™ hero is more iv a
villain thin thâ€™ villain himsilf. Heâ€™s thâ€™ sort iv a man that we used
to heave pavinâ€™ shtones at whin he come out iv thâ€™ stage dure iv thâ€™
Halsted Sthreet Opry House. To be a hero yeâ€™ve first got to be an
Englishman, anâ€™ as if that wasnâ€™t bad enough yeâ€™ve got to have committed
as many crimes as thâ€™ late H. H. Holmes. If heâ€™d been born in England
heâ€™d be a hero. Ye marry a woman who swears anâ€™ dhrinks anâ€™ bets on thâ€™
races anâ€™ ye quarrel with her. Thâ€™ r-rest iv thâ€™ play is made up iv hard
cracks be all thâ€™ char-ack-ters at each othersâ€™ morals. This is called
repartee be thâ€™ learned, anâ€™ Hogan. Repartee is where I say: â€˜Ye stole
a horseâ€™ anâ€™ ye say: â€˜But think iv yeâ€™er wife!â€™ In Ar-rchy r-road â€˜tis
called disordherly conduct. Theyâ€™se another play on where a man r-runs
off with a woman thatâ€™s no betther thin she ought to be. He bates her
anâ€™ she marries a burglar. Another wan is about a lady that ates dinner
with a German. He bites her anâ€™ she hits him with a cabbage. Thin
theyâ€™se a play about an English gintleman iv thâ€™ old school who thries
to make a girl write a letter fâ€™r him anâ€™ if she donâ€™t heâ€™ll tell on
her. He doesnâ€™t tell anâ€™ so heâ€™s rewarded with thâ€™ love iv thâ€™ heroine,

â€œNobodyâ€™s marrid in thâ€™ modhern play, Hinnissy, anâ€™ thatâ€™s a good thing,
too, fâ€™r annywan that got marrid wud have thâ€™ worst iv it. In thâ€™ olâ€™
times thâ€™ la-ads that announces whatâ€™s goinâ€™ to happen in the first act,
always promised ye a happy marredge in thâ€™ end anâ€™ as ivrybodyâ€™s lookinâ€™
fâ€™r a happy marredge, that held the aujeence. Now ye know that thâ€™ hero
with thâ€™ wretched past is goinâ€™ to elope with thâ€™ dhrunken lady anâ€™ thâ€™
play is goinâ€™ to end with thâ€™ couples prettily divorced in thâ€™ centher
iv thâ€™ stage. â€˜Tis called real life anâ€™ mebbe thatâ€™s what it is, but fâ€™r
me I donâ€™t want to see real life on thâ€™ stage. I can see that anny day.
What I want is fâ€™r thâ€™ spotless gintleman to saw thâ€™ la-ad with thâ€™
cigareet into two-be-fours anâ€™ marry thâ€™ lady that doesnâ€™t dhrink much

explaininâ€™ that he didnâ€™t mean all dimmycrats but onâ€™y those that
wuddenâ€™t vote fâ€™r Mack but I think heâ€™ll take thâ€™ copper off befure
manny weeks. A ladinâ€™ dimmycratic rayformer has suggested that Mack
though a good man fâ€™r an idjiot is surrounded be thâ€™ vilest scoundhrels
iver seen in public life since thâ€™ days iv Joolyus Caesar. Thâ€™ Sicrety
iv thâ€™ Threeasury has declared, that Mr. Bryan in sayinâ€™ that silver is
not convartible be thâ€™ terms iv thâ€™ Slatthry bankinâ€™ law iv 1870,
anâ€™ thâ€™ sicond clause iv thâ€™ threaty iv Gansville, has committed thâ€™

up thâ€™ possibility iv wan not knowinâ€™ thâ€™ thrue position iv affairs,
misundhersthandinâ€™ intirely. If he had him outside heâ€™d call him a liar.
Thâ€™ raypublicans have proved that Willum Jennings Bryan is a thraitor
be thâ€™ letther written be Dr. Lem Stoggins, thâ€™ cillybrated antithought
agytator iv Spooten Duyvil to Aggynaldoo in which he calls upon him to
do nawthinâ€™ till he hears frâ€™m thâ€™ doc. Thâ€™ letther was sint through
thâ€™ postal authorities anâ€™ as they have established no post-office
in Aggynaldooâ€™s hat they cuddenâ€™t deliver it anâ€™ they opened it. Upon

to Willum Jennings Bryan declarinâ€™ that if he (Plog) iver went to thâ€™
Phâ€™lippeens, which he wudâ€™ve done but fâ€™r thâ€™ way thâ€™ oats was sproutinâ€™
in thâ€™ stack, anâ€™ had been hit with a bullet heâ€™d ixpict thâ€™ Coroner to

dollars to thâ€™ campaign fund. In thâ€™ dimmycratic pa-apers I r-read that
Chairman Jim Jones has inthercipted a letther frâ€™m the Prince iv Wales
to Mack congratulatinâ€™ him on his appintmint as gintleman-in-waitinâ€™
to thâ€™ queen. A dillygation iv Mormons has started frâ€™m dimmycratic
headquarthers to thank Mack fâ€™r his manly stand in favor iv poly-gamy

â€œI know whatâ€™ll happen. Yeâ€™ll sind Packy to what thâ€™ Germans call a

injooce Rafferry, thâ€™ Janitor iv thâ€™ Isaac Muggs Grammar School, fâ€™r

settinâ€™ ar-round on thâ€™ flure anâ€™ some was moldinâ€™ dachshunds out iv mud

a few was dancinâ€™ anâ€™ wan la-ad was pullinâ€™ another la-adâ€™s hair. â€˜Why
donâ€™t ye take thâ€™ coal shovel to that little barbaryan, Mary Ellen?â€™
says I. â€˜We donâ€™t believe in corporeal punishment,â€™ says she. â€˜School
shud be made pleasant fâ€™r thâ€™ childher,â€™ she says. â€˜Thâ€™ child whoâ€™s hair
is beinâ€™ pulled is larninâ€™ patience,â€™ she says, â€˜anâ€™ thâ€™ child thatâ€™s
pullinâ€™ thâ€™ hair is discovrinâ€™ thâ€™ footility iv human indeavor,â€™ says

Mr. Dooley. â€œâ€˜Tis be thâ€™ same la-ad that wrote thâ€™ piece they played
down in thâ€™ Christyan Brothersâ€™ school last year about the man with thâ€™
big nose, that wud dhraw a soord or a pome on eâ€™er a man alive. This
wan is called â€˜The Little Eagle,â€™ anâ€™ â€˜tis about thâ€™ son iv Napolyon thâ€™
Impror iv thâ€™ Fr-rinch, thâ€™ first wan, not thâ€™ wan I had thâ€™ fight about
in Schwartzmeisterâ€™s in eighteen hundhred anâ€™ siventy. Bad cess to that
man, he was no good. I often wondher why I shtud up fâ€™r him whin he
had hardly wan frind in thâ€™ counthry. But I did, anâ€™ ye might say Iâ€™m a
vethran iv thâ€™ Napolyonic Wars. I am so.
â€œBut thâ€™ first Napolyon was a diffâ€™rent man, anâ€™ whin he died he left a
son that thâ€™ coorts tur-rned over to thâ€™ custody iv his mother, thâ€™ olâ€™
man beinâ€™ on thâ€™ island--thâ€™ same place where Ginâ€™ral Crownjoy is
now. Tis about this la-ad thâ€™ playâ€™s written. He donâ€™t look to be
much account havinâ€™ a hackinâ€™ cough all through the piece, but down
undherneath he wants to be impror iv thâ€™ Fr-rinch like his father befure
him, dâ€™ye mind, onâ€™y he donâ€™t dare to go out fâ€™r it fâ€™r fear iv catchinâ€™
a bad cold on his chist. Thâ€™ Austhreeches that has charge iv him donâ€™t
like thâ€™ idee iv havinâ€™ him know what kind iv man his father was. Whin
he asks: â€˜Whereâ€™s pah?â€™ They say: â€˜He died in jail.â€™ â€˜What happened in
1805?â€™ says thâ€™ boy. â€˜In 1805,â€™ says thâ€™ Austhreeches, â€˜thâ€™ bar-rn blew
down.â€™ â€˜In 1806?â€™ says thâ€™ boy. â€˜In 1806 thâ€™ chimney smoked.â€™ â€˜Not so,â€™
says thâ€™ prince. â€˜In 1806 me father crossed thâ€™ Rhine anâ€™ up,â€™ he says,
â€˜thâ€™ ar-rmed camps he marched to Augaspiel, to Lieberneck, to Donnervet.
He changed his boots at Mikelstraus anâ€™ down thâ€™ eagle swooped on
Marcobrun,â€™ he says. â€˜Me granâ€™dad fled as flees thâ€™ hen befure thâ€™ hawk,
but dad stayed not till granâ€™pa, treed, besought fâ€™r peace. Thatâ€™s
what me father done unto me granâ€™dad in eighteen six.â€™ At this pâ€™int he
coughs but ye sees he knew what was goinâ€™ on, beinâ€™ taught in secret be
a lady iv thâ€™ stage frâ€™m whom manny a la-ad cud larn thâ€™ truth about his
father.
â€œStill he canâ€™t be persuaded fâ€™r to apply fâ€™r thâ€™ vacant improrship on
account iv his lungs, till wan day a tailor shows up to measure him fâ€™r
some clothes. Thâ€™ tailor dâ€™ye mind is a rivolutionist in disguise,

says.

â€œFâ€™r thâ€™ same reason that the Irish rivolution failed, thâ€™ polis
stopped it. Thâ€™ con-spirators met in thâ€™ park anâ€™ were nailed be a park

which was where his father wanst fought a battle. As he shtands there
coughinâ€™ he begins to hear voices iv soops that followed thâ€™ olâ€™ Impror.

havinâ€™ a wife livinâ€™ that was as tough as they make thim. But annyhow

him off with sivâ€™ral ladies that loved him anâ€™ others. Beinâ€™ a busy anâ€™
