CRIME AND PUNISHMENT
By Fyodor Dostoevsky
Translated By Constance Garnett
TRANSLATORâ€™S PREFACE
A few words about Dostoevsky himself may help the English reader to
understand his work.
Dostoevsky was the son of a doctor. His parents were very hard-working
and deeply religious people, but so poor that they lived with their five
children in only two rooms. The father and mother spent their evenings
in reading aloud to their children, generally from books of a serious
character.
Though always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out third in the
final examination of the Petersburg school of Engineering. There he had

was received with acclamations. The shy, unknown youth found himself
instantly something of a celebrity. A brilliant and successful career
seemed to open before him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he
was arrested.
Though neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist, Dostoevsky
was one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourier
and Proudhon. He was accused of â€œtaking part in conversations against
the censorship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of

enough, and he was condemned to death. After eight monthsâ€™ imprisonment
he was with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to
be shot. Writing to his brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: â€œThey snapped
words over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by
persons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes,
to suffer execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only
a few minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones and
I contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to
bid them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were unbound,

One of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he was untied, and
never regained his sanity.
The intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on
Dostoevskyâ€™s mind. Though his religious temper led him in the end to
accept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing
in his own case, he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings.
He describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the
cruelty of inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal

He had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest
and this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy, from which he
suffered for the rest of his life. The fits occurred three or four times
a year and were more frequent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was

dependent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, and is
said never to have corrected his work. The later years of his life were
much softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife.
In June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the
monument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was received with extraordinary
demonstrations of love and honour.

which we seek that we may learn from it how to live. All his other

CRIME AND PUNISHMENT
PART I
CHAPTER I
On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of
the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though
in hesitation, towards K. bridge.
He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His
garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more
like a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret,
dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time
he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which
invariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a
sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was
hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.
This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but
for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,
verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in
himself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not
only his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the
anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had
given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all
desire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror
for him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her
trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats
and complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to
lie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and
slip out unseen.
This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely
aware of his fears.
â€œI want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these
NA
hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, thatâ€™s an axiom. It would
be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new
step, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking
too much. Itâ€™s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is
that I chatter because I do nothing. Iâ€™ve learned to chatter this
last month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the
Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is
_that_ serious? It is not serious at all. Itâ€™s simply a fantasy to amuse
NA
The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle
and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that
special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out
of town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young manâ€™s already
overwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which
are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men
whom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed
the revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest
disgust gleamed for a moment in the young manâ€™s refined face. He was,
by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,
well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank
into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness
of mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring
to observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the
habit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these
moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a
tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted
food.
He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would
have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter
of the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have
created surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number
of establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading
and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the
heart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets
that no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was
such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young manâ€™s heart, that,
in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least
of all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with
acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked
meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown
reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy
dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: â€œHey there, German
NA
man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall
round hat from Zimmermanâ€™s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all
torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly
fashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror
had overtaken him.
NA
of all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might
spoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurd
and that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any
sort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such
a hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... What
matters is that people would remember it, and that would give them
a clue. For this business one should be as little conspicuous as
possible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, itâ€™s just such

He had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate
of his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He had counted
them once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no
faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous
but daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon
them differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at
his own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard

still did not realise this himself. He was positively going now for a
NA
and more violent.
With a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house
which on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the
street. This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by
working people of all kinds--tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of
sorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc.
There was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the
two courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed on
the building. The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and
at once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the
staircase. It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar
with it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings:
in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.
â€œIf I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that

reached the fourth storey. There his progress was barred by some porters
who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the
flat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his
family. This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this
staircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. â€œThatâ€™s a good
NA
womanâ€™s flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of
tin and not of copper. The little flats in such houses always have bells
that ring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and now
its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it
clearly before him.... He started, his nerves were terribly overstrained
by now. In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old
woman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and
nothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness.
But, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and
opened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, which
was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. The old woman stood facing
him in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a diminutive,
withered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp
little nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared
with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long neck,
which looked like a henâ€™s leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag,
and, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy
fur cape, yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every
instant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar
expression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.

polite.

old woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face.

she is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other

The old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side,
and pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass
in front of her:

the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly

chance through Raskolnikovâ€™s mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned
everything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and
remember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. The
furniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with
a huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a
dressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows,
chairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow
frames, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that was
all. In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. Everything
was very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished;
everything shone.

â€œItâ€™s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such

at the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in
which stood the old womanâ€™s bed and chest of drawers and into which he
had never looked before. These two rooms made up the whole flat.

the face.

globe; the chain was of steel.

young man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of going
away; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere
else he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming.
NA
The old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behind
the curtain into the other room. The young man, left standing alone in
the middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking. He could hear
her unlocking the chest of drawers.
NA
a pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel ring.... And thereâ€™s
one key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches;
that canâ€™t be the key of the chest of drawers... then there must be some
other chest or strong-box... thatâ€™s worth knowing. Strong-boxes always

The old woman came back.
â€œHere, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so I must take
fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance. But
for the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me now twenty copecks
on the same reckoning in advance. That makes thirty-five copecks
altogether. So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the

NA
NA
The young man did not dispute it and took the money. He looked at the
old woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was still
something he wanted to say or to do, but he did not himself quite know
what.
â€œI may be bringing you something else in a day or two, Alyona
Ivanovna--a valuable thing--silver--a cigarette-box, as soon as I get it

NA
â€œGood-bye--are you always at home alone, your sister is not here with

passage.
NA
â€œOh, nothing particular, I simply asked. You are too quick.... Good-day,
NA
Raskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This confusion became more
and more intense. As he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, two
or three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought. When he was
in the street he cried out, â€œOh, God, how loathsome it all is! and
NA
resolutely. â€œAnd how could such an atrocious thing come into my head?
What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all,
NA
 But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. The feeling
of intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart
while he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a
pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to
do with himself to escape from his wretchedness. He walked along the
pavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostling
against them, and only came to his senses when he was in the next
street. Looking round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern
which was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement.
At that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing and
supporting one another, they mounted the steps. Without stopping to
think, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once. Till that moment he had
never been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a
burning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his
sudden weakness to the want of food. He sat down at a sticky little
table in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drank
off the first glassful. At once he felt easier; and his thoughts became
clear.
NA
all to worry about! Itâ€™s simply physical derangement. Just a glass of
beer, a piece of dry bread--and in one moment the brain is stronger,
the mind is clearer and the will is firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all
NA
But in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now looking cheerful
as though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazed
round in a friendly way at the people in the room. But even at that
moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also
not normal.
There were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides the two drunken
men he had met on the steps, a group consisting of about five men and
a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time. Their departure
left the room quiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavern
were a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not extremely so,
sitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, a huge, stout man with
a grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat. He was very drunk: and had
dropped asleep on the bench; every now and then, he began as though in
his sleep, cracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the upper
part of his body bounding about on the bench, while he hummed some
meaningless refrain, trying to recall some such lines as these:
   â€œHis wife a year he fondly loved
NA
Or suddenly waking up again:
   â€œWalking along the crowded row
NA
But no one shared his enjoyment: his silent companion looked with
positive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations. There was
another man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government
clerk. He was sitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and
looking round at the company. He, too, appeared to be in some agitation.
CHAPTER II
Raskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoided
society of every sort, more especially of late. But now all at once he
felt a desire to be with other people. Something new seemed to be taking
place within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He
was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy
excitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other
world, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of the
surroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern.
The master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequently
came down some steps into the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots with
red turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his
person. He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat,
with no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an
iron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was
another boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted. On the
counter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and
some fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferably
close, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such
an atmosphere might well make a man drunk.
There are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the
first moment, before a word is spoken. Such was the impression made on
Raskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him, who looked
like a retired clerk. The young man often recalled this impression
afterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked repeatedly
at the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staring
persistently at him, obviously anxious to enter into conversation. At
the other persons in the room, including the tavern-keeper, the clerk
looked as though he were used to their company, and weary of it, showing
a shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and
culture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him to
converse. He was a man over fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height,
and stoutly built. His face, bloated from continual drinking, was of
a yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen
reddish eyes gleamed like little chinks. But there was something very
strange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense
feeling--perhaps there were even thought and intelligence, but at the
same time there was a gleam of something like madness. He was wearing an
old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missing
except one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this
last trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered with spots
and stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. Like a clerk, he wore
no beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his chin
looked like a stiff greyish brush. And there was something respectable
and like an official about his manner too. But he was restless; he
ruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his
hands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky
table. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, and said loudly and
resolutely:
â€œMay I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite conversation?
Forasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, my
experience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not
accustomed to drinking. I have always respected education when in
conjunction with genuine sentiments, and I am besides a titular
counsellor in rank. Marmeladov--such is my name; titular counsellor. I

the grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly
addressed. In spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for
company of any sort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his
habitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached
or attempted to approach him.

tapped his forehead with his fingers in self-approval. â€œYouâ€™ve been a

 He got up, staggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down beside
the young man, facing him a little sideways. He was drunk, but spoke
fluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the thread of his
sentences and drawling his words. He pounced upon Raskolnikov as
greedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month.
NA
thatâ€™s a true saying. Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue,
and that thatâ€™s even truer. But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a
vice. In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but
in beggary--never--no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of human
society with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as
humiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggary
I am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. Hence the pot-house!
Honoured sir, a month ago Mr. Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and
my wife is a very different matter from me! Do you understand? Allow me
to ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent

fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair. It seemed quite
probable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days.
His hands, particularly, were filthy. They were fat and red, with black
nails.
His conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest. The
boys at the counter fell to sniggering. The innkeeper came down from the
NA
 and sat down at a little distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity.
Evidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most
likely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit of
frequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in
the tavern. This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards, and
especially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order
at home. Hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify
themselves and even if possible obtain consideration.

himself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as though it had been he who put
that question to him. â€œWhy am I not at my duty? Does not my heart ache
to think what a useless worm I am? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov
beat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didnâ€™t I suffer?
Excuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you... hm... well, to

â€œHopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that you
will get nothing by it. You know, for instance, beforehand with positive
certainty that this man, this most reputable and exemplary citizen, will
on no consideration give you money; and indeed I ask you why should he?
For he knows of course that I shanâ€™t pay it back. From compassion? But
Mr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day
that compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and that thatâ€™s
what is done now in England, where there is political economy. Why, I
ask you, should he give it to me? And yet though I know beforehand that

composure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the
innkeeper smiled--â€œNo matter, I am not confounded by the wagging of

that is secret is made open. And I accept it all, not with contempt, but
with humility. So be it! So be it! â€˜Behold the man!â€™ Excuse me, young
man, can you.... No, to put it more strongly and more distinctly; not

The young man did not answer a word.

after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside. â€œWell, so be
it, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I have the semblance of a beast, but
Katerina Ivanovna, my spouse, is a person of education and an officerâ€™s
daughter. Granted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of a
noble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. And yet... oh,
if only she felt for me! Honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every man
ought to have at least one place where people feel for him! But Katerina
Ivanovna, though she is magnanimous, she is unjust.... And yet, although
I realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity--for

God, if she would but once.... But no, no! Itâ€™s all in vain and itâ€™s no

â€œSuch is my fate! Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her very
stockings for drink? Not her shoes--that would be more or less in the
order of things, but her stockings, her stockings I have sold for drink!
Her mohair shawl I sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her own
property, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this
winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too. We have three
little children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning till
night; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for sheâ€™s
been used to cleanliness from a child. But her chest is weak and she has
a tendency to consumption and I feel it! Do you suppose I donâ€™t feel it?

read some trouble of mind. When you came in I read it, and that was why
I addressed you at once. For in unfolding to you the story of my life, I
do not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners,
who indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a man
of feeling and education. Know then that my wife was educated in a
high-class school for the daughters of noblemen, and on leaving she
danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for
which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit.
The medal... well, the medal of course was sold--long ago, hm... but the
certificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed
it to our landlady. And although she is most continually on bad terms
with the landlady, yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past
honours and of the happy days that are gone. I donâ€™t condemn her for
it, I donâ€™t blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection of
the past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she is a lady
of spirit, proud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has
nothing but black bread to eat, but wonâ€™t allow herself to be treated
with disrespect. Thatâ€™s why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikovâ€™s
rudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took to
her bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows. She was
a widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than the
other. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and
ran away with him from her fatherâ€™s house. She was exceedingly fond of
her husband; but he gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that he
died. He used to beat her at the end: and although she paid him back, of
which I have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of
him with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad, I am glad
that, though only in imagination, she should think of herself as having
once been happy.... And she was left at his death with three children in
a wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and she
was left in such hopeless poverty that, although I have seen many ups
and downs of all sort, I donâ€™t feel equal to describing it even. Her
relations had all thrown her off. And she was proud, too, excessively
proud.... And then, honoured sir, and then, I, being at the time a
widower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offered
her my hand, for I could not bear the sight of such suffering. You can
judge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a woman of education
and culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be my
wife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands, she
married me! For she had nowhere to turn! Do you understand, sir, do you
understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No,
that you donâ€™t understand yet.... And for a whole year, I performed
NA
tapped the jug with his finger), â€œfor I have feelings. But even so, I
could not please her; and then I lost my place too, and that through no
fault of mine but through changes in the office; and then I did touch
it!... It will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at
last after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent
capital, adorned with innumerable monuments. Here I obtained a
situation.... I obtained it and I lost it again. Do you understand? This
time it was through my own fault I lost it: for my weakness had come
out.... We have now part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechselâ€™s;
and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say.
There are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. Dirt and
disorder, a perfect Bedlam... hm... yes... And meanwhile my daughter by
my first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up with
from her step-mother whilst she was growing up, I wonâ€™t speak of. For,
though Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spirited
lady, irritable and short-tempered.... Yes. But itâ€™s no use going over
that! Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education. I did make an
effort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal
history, but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and we
had no suitable books, and what books we had... hm, anyway we have not
even those now, so all our instruction came to an end. We stopped at
Cyrus of Persia. Since she has attained years of maturity, she has read
other books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great
interest a book she got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, Lewesâ€™ Physiology--do
you know it?--and even recounted extracts from it to us: and thatâ€™s the
whole of her education. And now may I venture to address you, honoured
sir, on my own account with a private question. Do you suppose that
a respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteen
farthings a day can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special
talent and that without putting her work down for an instant! And whatâ€™s
more, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor--have you heard of
him?--has not to this day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirts she
made him and drove her roughly away, stamping and reviling her, on the
pretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were
put in askew. And there are the little ones hungry.... And Katerina
Ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands, her cheeks flushed
red, as they always are in that disease: â€˜Here you live with us,â€™ says
she, â€˜you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help.â€™
And much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the
little ones for three days! I was lying at the time... well, what of
it! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she is a gentle
creature with a soft little voice... fair hair and such a pale, thin
little face). She said: â€˜Katerina Ivanovna, am I really to do a thing
like that?â€™ And Darya Frantsovna, a woman of evil character and very
well known to the police, had two or three times tried to get at her
through the landlady. â€˜And why not?â€™ said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer,
â€˜you are something mighty precious to be so careful of!â€™ But donâ€™t blame
her, donâ€™t blame her, honoured sir, donâ€™t blame her! She was not herself
when she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying
of the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than anything
else.... For thatâ€™s Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s character, and when children
cry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them at once. At six oâ€™clock
I saw Sonia get up, put on her kerchief and her cape, and go out of the
room and about nine oâ€™clock she came back. She walked straight up to
Katerina Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her
in silence. She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, she
simply picked up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl (we have a shawl,
made of _drap de dames_), put it over her head and face and lay down
on the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her
body kept shuddering.... And I went on lying there, just as before....
And then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence
go up to Soniaâ€™s little bed; she was on her knees all the evening
kissing Soniaâ€™s feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell
asleep in each otherâ€™s arms... together, together... yes... and I... lay

Marmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him. Then he

to an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by
evil-intentioned persons--in all which Darya Frantsovna took a
leading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of
respect--since then my daughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take
a yellow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living with
us. For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it (though
she had backed up Darya Frantsovna before) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too...
hm.... All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Soniaâ€™s
account. At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and then all of
a sudden he stood on his dignity: â€˜how,â€™ said he, â€˜can a highly educated
man like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?â€™ And Katerina
Ivanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her... and so thatâ€™s
how it happened. And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she
comforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can.... She has a room
at the Kapernaumovsâ€™ the tailors, she lodges with them; Kapernaumov is
a lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft
palates too. And his wife, too, has a cleft palate. They all live in one
room, but Sonia has her own, partitioned off.... Hm... yes... very poor
people and all with cleft palates... yes. Then I got up in the morning,
and put on my rags, lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to his
excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch. His excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch, do you
know him? No? Well, then, itâ€™s a man of God you donâ€™t know. He is wax...
wax before the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth!... His eyes were
dim when he heard my story. â€˜Marmeladov, once already you have
deceived my expectations... Iâ€™ll take you once more on my own
responsibilityâ€™--thatâ€™s what he said, â€˜remember,â€™ he said, â€˜and now you
can go.â€™ I kissed the dust at his feet--in thought only, for in reality
he would not have allowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man of
modern political and enlightened ideas. I returned home, and when I
announced that Iâ€™d been taken back into the service and should receive a

Marmeladov stopped again in violent excitement. At that moment a whole
party of revellers already drunk came in from the street, and the sounds
of a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven

noise. The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the new-comers.
Marmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story.
He appeared by now to be extremely weak, but as he became more and more
drunk, he became more and more talkative. The recollection of his
recent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him, and was
positively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face. Raskolnikov
listened attentively.
â€œThat was five weeks ago, sir. Yes.... As soon as Katerina Ivanovna
and Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though I stepped into the
kingdom of Heaven. It used to be: you can lie like a beast, nothing but
abuse. Now they were walking on tiptoe, hushing the children. â€˜Semyon
Zaharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, shh!â€™
They made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream for me! They
began to get real cream for me, do you hear that? And how they managed
to get together the money for a decent outfit--eleven roubles, fifty
copecks, I canâ€™t guess. Boots, cotton shirt-fronts--most magnificent,
a uniform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles and
a half. The first morning I came back from the office I found Katerina
Ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner--soup and salt meat with
horse radish--which we had never dreamed of till then. She had not any
dresses... none at all, but she got herself up as though she were going
on a visit; and not that sheâ€™d anything to do it with, she smartened
herself up with nothing at all, sheâ€™d done her hair nicely, put on a
clean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a different
person, she was younger and better looking. Sonia, my little darling,
had only helped with money â€˜for the time,â€™ she said, â€˜it wonâ€™t do for me
to come and see you too often. After dark maybe when no one can see.â€™ Do
you hear, do you hear? I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you
think: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with
our landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she could not
resist then asking her in to coffee. For two hours they were sitting,
whispering together. â€˜Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again,
now, and receiving a salary,â€™ says she, â€˜and he went himself to his
excellency and his excellency himself came out to him, made all the
others wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into
his study.â€™ Do you hear, do you hear? â€˜To be sure,â€™ says he, â€˜Semyon
Zaharovitch, remembering your past services,â€™ says he, â€˜and in spite
of your propensity to that foolish weakness, since you promise now and
since moreover weâ€™ve got on badly without you,â€™ (do you hear, do you
hear;) â€˜and so,â€™ says he, â€˜I rely now on your word as a gentleman.â€™ And
all that, let me tell you, she has simply made up for herself, and not
simply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; no, she believes it
all herself, she amuses herself with her own fancies, upon my word she
does! And I donâ€™t blame her for it, no, I donâ€™t blame her!... Six days
ago when I brought her my first earnings in full--twenty-three roubles
forty copecks altogether--she called me her poppet: â€˜poppet,â€™ said she,
â€˜my little poppet.â€™ And when we were by ourselves, you understand?
You would not think me a beauty, you would not think much of me as a
husband, would you?... Well, she pinched my cheek, â€˜my little poppet,â€™
NA
Marmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his chin began
to twitch. He controlled himself however. The tavern, the degraded
appearance of the man, the five nights in the hay barge, and the pot of
spirits, and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewildered
his listener. Raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation.
He felt vexed that he had come here.
NA
sir, perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you, as it does to
others, and perhaps I am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the
trivial details of my home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me.
For I can feel it all.... And the whole of that heavenly day of my life
and the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams of how I would
arrange it all, and how I would dress all the children, and how I should
give her rest, and how I should rescue my own daughter from dishonour
and restore her to the bosom of her family.... And a great deal more....
NA
of start, raised his head and gazed intently at his listener) â€œwell, on
the very next day after all those dreams, that is to say, exactly five
days ago, in the evening, by a cunning trick, like a thief in the night,
I stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box, took out what was
left of my earnings, how much it was I have forgotten, and now look
at me, all of you! Itâ€™s the fifth day since I left home, and they are
looking for me there and itâ€™s the end of my employment, and my uniform
is lying in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge. I exchanged it for the

Marmeladov struck his forehead with his fist, clenched his teeth, closed
his eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table. But a minute
later his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and
affectation of bravado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said:
â€œThis morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a pick-me-up!
NA
NA
shouted the words and went off into a guffaw.
NA
addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. â€œThirty copecks she gave
me with her own hands, her last, all she had, as I saw.... She said
nothing, she only looked at me without a word.... Not on earth, but up
yonder... they grieve over men, they weep, but they donâ€™t blame them,
they donâ€™t blame them! But it hurts more, it hurts more when they donâ€™t
blame! Thirty copecks yes! And maybe she needs them now, eh? What do
you think, my dear sir? For now sheâ€™s got to keep up her appearance. It
costs money, that smartness, that special smartness, you know? Do you
understand? And thereâ€™s pomatum, too, you see, she must have things;
petticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real jaunty ones to show off her
foot when she has to step over a puddle. Do you understand, sir, do you
understand what all that smartness means? And here I, her own father,
here I took thirty copecks of that money for a drink! And I am drinking
it! And I have already drunk it! Come, who will have pity on a man like
me, eh? Are you sorry for me, sir, or not? Tell me, sir, are you sorry

He would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left. The pot was

Shouts of laughter and even oaths followed. The laughter and the oaths
came from those who were listening and also from those who had heard
nothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged
government clerk.

standing up with his arm outstretched, as though he had been only
waiting for that question.
â€œWhy am I to be pitied, you say? Yes! thereâ€™s nothing to pity me for! I
ought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not pitied! Crucify me,
oh judge, crucify me but pity me! And then I will go of myself to be
crucified, for itâ€™s not merry-making I seek but tears and tribulation!...
Do you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has been
sweet to me? It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and
tribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will pity
us Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and all
things, He is the One, He too is the judge. He will come in that day
and He will ask: â€˜Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross,
consumptive step-mother and for the little children of another? Where is
the daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earthly father,
undismayed by his beastliness?â€™ And He will say, â€˜Come to me! I have
already forgiven thee once.... I have forgiven thee once.... Thy sins
which are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much....â€™ And he
will forgive my Sonia, He will forgive, I know it... I felt it in my
heart when I was with her just now! And He will judge and will forgive
all, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek.... And when He has
done with all of them, then He will summon us. â€˜You too come forth,â€™
He will say, â€˜Come forth ye drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come
forth, ye children of shame!â€™ And we shall all come forth, without shame
and shall stand before him. And He will say unto us, â€˜Ye are swine, made
in the Image of the Beast and with his mark; but come ye also!â€™ And the
wise ones and those of understanding will say, â€˜Oh Lord, why dost Thou
receive these men?â€™ And He will say, â€˜This is why I receive them, oh ye
wise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, that not one
of them believed himself to be worthy of this.â€™ And He will hold out His
hands to us and we shall fall down before him... and we shall weep...
and we shall understand all things! Then we shall understand all!... and
all will understand, Katerina Ivanovna even... she will understand....

helpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious of his surroundings
and plunged in deep thought. His words had created a certain impression;
there was a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were heard
again.

Raskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to
help him. Marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech

confusion as they drew nearer the house.

agitation--â€œand that she will begin pulling my hair. What does my hair

she does begin pulling it, thatâ€™s not what I am afraid of... itâ€™s her
eyes I am afraid of... yes, her eyes... the red on her cheeks, too,
frightens me... and her breathing too.... Have you noticed how people
in that disease breathe... when they are excited? I am frightened of
the childrenâ€™s crying, too.... For if Sonia has not taken them food...
I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s happened! I donâ€™t know! But blows I am not afraid

enjoyment. In fact I canâ€™t get on without it.... Itâ€™s better so. Let
her strike me, it relieves her heart... itâ€™s better so... There is the
house. The house of Kozel, the cabinet-maker... a German, well-to-do.
NA
They went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey. The staircase
got darker and darker as they went up. It was nearly eleven oâ€™clock
and although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night, yet it was
quite dark at the top of the stairs.
A grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar. A very
poor-looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end;
the whole of it was visible from the entrance. It was all in disorder,
littered up with rags of all sorts, especially childrenâ€™s garments.
Across the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet. Behind it
probably was the bed. There was nothing in the room except two chairs
and a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, before which
stood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and uncovered. At the edge
of the table stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick. It
appeared that the family had a room to themselves, not part of a room,
but their room was practically a passage. The door leading to the other
rooms, or rather cupboards, into which Amalia Lippevechselâ€™s flat was
divided stood half open, and there was shouting, uproar and laughter
within. People seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there. Words
of the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time.
Raskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once. She was a rather tall,
slim and graceful woman, terribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brown
hair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks. She was pacing up and down
in her little room, pressing her hands against her chest; her lips
were parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps. Her eyes
glittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare. And
that consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the
candle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression. She seemed to
Raskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for
Marmeladov.... She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in.
She seemed to be lost in thought, hearing and seeing nothing. The room
was close, but she had not opened the window; a stench rose from the
staircase, but the door on to the stairs was not closed. From the inner
rooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept coughing, but did not
close the door. The youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sitting
curled up on the floor with her head on the sofa. A boy a year older
stood crying and shaking in the corner, probably he had just had a
beating. Beside him stood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin,
wearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung
over her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her knees.
Her arm, as thin as a stick, was round her brotherâ€™s neck. She was
trying to comfort him, whispering something to him, and doing all she
could to keep him from whimpering again. At the same time her large
dark eyes, which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened
face, were watching her mother with alarm. Marmeladov did not enter the
door, but dropped on his knees in the very doorway, pushing Raskolnikov
in front of him. The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently
facing him, coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what
he had come for. But evidently she decided that he was going into
the next room, as he had to pass through hers to get there. Taking no
further notice of him, she walked towards the outer door to close it
and uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the
doorway.
NA
monster!... And where is the money? Whatâ€™s in your pocket, show me! And
your clothes are all different! Where are your clothes? Where is the

And she fell to searching him. Marmeladov submissively and obediently
held up both arms to facilitate the search. Not a farthing was there.

she seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room. Marmeladov
seconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees.
â€œAnd this is a consolation to me! This does not hurt me, but is a

fro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead.
The child asleep on the floor woke up, and began to cry. The boy in the
corner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed
to his sister in violent terror, almost in a fit. The eldest girl was
shaking like a leaf.
NA
NA
wringing her hands she pointed to the children. â€œOh, accursed life!
NA
Raskolnikov--â€œfrom the tavern! Have you been drinking with him? You have
NA
The young man was hastening away without uttering a word. The inner door
was thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it. Coarse
laughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust
themselves in at the doorway. Further in could be seen figures in
dressing gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, some of
them with cards in their hands. They were particularly diverted, when
Marmeladov, dragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a consolation
to him. They even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrill
outcry was heard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing her
way amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and
for the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her
with coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day. As he went out,
Raskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket, to snatch up the
coppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to
lay them unnoticed on the window. Afterwards on the stairs, he changed
his mind and would have gone back.
NA
NA
take it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it, he
dismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging.

laughed malignantly--â€œsuch smartness costs money.... Hm! And maybe Sonia
herself will be bankrupt to-day, for there is always a risk, hunting
big game... digging for gold... then they would all be without a crust
to-morrow except for my money. Hurrah for Sonia! What a mine theyâ€™ve dug
there! And theyâ€™re making the most of it! Yes, they are making the most

CHAPTER III
He waked up late next day after a broken sleep. But his sleep had not
refreshed him; he waked up bilious, irritable, ill-tempered, and looked
with hatred at his room. It was a tiny cupboard of a room about six
paces in length. It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty
yellow paper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that a man
of more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment
that he would knock his head against the ceiling. The furniture was in
keeping with the room: there were three old chairs, rather rickety; a
painted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books;
the dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long
untouched. A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and
half the floor space of the room; it was once covered with chintz, but
was now in rags and served Raskolnikov as a bed. Often he went to sleep
on it, as he was, without undressing, without sheets, wrapped in his old
studentâ€™s overcoat, with his head on one little pillow, under which he
heaped up all the linen he had, clean and dirty, by way of a bolster. A
little table stood in front of the sofa.
It would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder, but to
Raskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable.
He had got completely away from everyone, like a tortoise in its shell,
and even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked
sometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation. He was
in the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated
upon one thing. His landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending
him in meals, and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her,
though he went without his dinner. Nastasya, the cook and only servant,
was rather pleased at the lodgerâ€™s mood and had entirely given up
sweeping and doing his room, only once a week or so she would stray into
his room with a broom. She waked him up that day.

A minute later the letter was brought him. That was it: from his mother,

suddenly stabbed his heart.

The letter was quivering in his hand; he did not want to open it in her
presence; he wanted to be left _alone_ with this letter. When Nastasya
had gone out, he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it; then he
gazed intently at the address, the small, sloping handwriting, so dear
and familiar, of the mother who had once taught him to read and write.
He delayed; he seemed almost afraid of something. At last he opened it;
it was a thick heavy letter, weighing over two ounces, two large sheets

talk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me
awake at night, thinking. But I am sure you will not blame me for my
inevitable silence. You know how I love you; you are all we have to look
to, Dounia and I, you are our all, our one hope, our one stay. What a
grief it was to me when I heard that you had given up the university
some months ago, for want of means to keep yourself and that you had
lost your lessons and your other work! How could I help you out of my
hundred and twenty roubles a year pension? The fifteen roubles I sent
you four months ago I borrowed, as you know, on security of my pension,
from Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin a merchant of this town. He is a
kind-hearted man and was a friend of your fatherâ€™s too. But having given
him the right to receive the pension, I had to wait till the debt was
paid off and that is only just done, so that Iâ€™ve been unable to send
you anything all this time. But now, thank God, I believe I shall
be able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate
ourselves on our good fortune now, of which I hasten to inform you. In
the first place, would you have guessed, dear Rodya, that your sister
has been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be
separated in the future. Thank God, her sufferings are over, but I will
tell you everything in order, so that you may know just how everything
has happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you. When you
wrote to me two months ago that you had heard that Dounia had a great
deal to put up with in the SvidrigraÃ¯lovsâ€™ house, when you wrote that
and asked me to tell you all about it--what could I write in answer to
you? If I had written the whole truth to you, I dare say you would have
thrown up everything and have come to us, even if you had to walk all
the way, for I know your character and your feelings, and you would not
let your sister be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what could I
do? And, besides, I did not know the whole truth myself then. What
made it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roubles
in advance when she took the place as governess in their family, on
condition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so it
was impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt.
This sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious Rodya) she took
chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terribly
then and which you received from us last year. We deceived you then,
writing that this money came from Douniaâ€™s savings, but that was not
so, and now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things have
suddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how Dounia loves
you and what a heart she has. At first indeed Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov treated
her very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at
table.... But I donâ€™t want to go into all those painful details, so as
not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over. In short, in spite
of the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lovâ€™s
wife, and all the rest of the household, Dounia had a very hard time,
especially when Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov, relapsing into his old regimental
habits, was under the influence of Bacchus. And how do you think it
was all explained later on? Would you believe that the crazy fellow had
conceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, but had concealed
it under a show of rudeness and contempt. Possibly he was ashamed and
horrified himself at his own flighty hopes, considering his years and
his being the father of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia.
And possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide
the truth from others. But at last he lost all control and had the face
to make Dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts of
inducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her
to another estate of his, or even abroad. You can imagine all she went
through! To leave her situation at once was impossible not only on
account of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of Marfa
Petrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Dounia
would have been the cause of a rupture in the family. And it would
have meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have been
inevitable. There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could
not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks. You know
Dounia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she
has. Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases
she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. She did not even write
to me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we were
constantly in communication. It all ended very unexpectedly. Marfa
Petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in the
garden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threw
the blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all. An awful
scene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna
went so far as to strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was
shouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should
be packed off at once to me in a plain peasantâ€™s cart, into which they
flung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, without
folding it up and packing it. And a heavy shower of rain came on, too,
and Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an
open cart all the seventeen versts into town. Only think now what answer
could I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago and
what could I have written? I was in despair; I dared not write to
you the truth because you would have been very unhappy, mortified
and indignant, and yet what could you do? You could only perhaps ruin
yourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letter
with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, I could not. For a
whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it came
to such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account
of the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud about
us. All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in the
street, and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to
insult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with pitch,
so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave. All this was set
going by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt at
her in every family. She knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and that
month she was continually coming into the town, and as she is
rather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and
particularly of complaining to all and each of her husband--which is not
at all right--so in a short time she had spread her story not only in
the town, but over the whole surrounding district. It made me ill, but
Dounia bore it better than I did, and if only you could have seen how
she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up! She is
an angel! But by Godâ€™s mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr.
SvidrigaÃ¯lov returned to his senses and repented and, probably
feeling sorry for Dounia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete and
unmistakable proof of Douniaâ€™s innocence, in the form of a letter Dounia
had been forced to write and give to him, before Marfa Petrovna
came upon them in the garden. This letter, which remained in Mr.
SvidrigaÃ¯lovâ€™s hands after her departure, she had written to refuse
personal explanations and secret interviews, for which he was entreating
her. In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation
for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna, reminding
him that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how
infamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl,
unhappy enough already. Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and
touchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot
read it without tears. Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too,
cleared Douniaâ€™s reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more
than Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov had himself supposed--as indeed is always the case
with servants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and â€˜again
crushedâ€™ as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced of
Douniaâ€™s innocence. The very next day, being Sunday, she went straight
to the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give
her strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then she
came straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, wept
bitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and besought her to
forgive her. The same morning without any delay, she went round to all
the houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in
the most flattering terms Douniaâ€™s innocence and the nobility of
her feelings and her behavior. What was more, she showed and read to
everyone the letter in Douniaâ€™s own handwriting to Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov and
even allowed them to take copies of it--which I must say I think was
superfluous. In this way she was busy for several days in driving about
the whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedence
having been given to others. And therefore they had to take turns, so
that in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyone
knew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the
letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading
of it, even many who had heard it several times already both in their
own houses and in other peopleâ€™s. In my opinion a great deal, a very
great deal of all this was unnecessary; but thatâ€™s Marfa Petrovnaâ€™s
character. Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Douniaâ€™s
reputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible
disgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I really
began to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow too
harshly. Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families,
but she refused. All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked
respect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one may
say, our whole fortunes are now transformed. You must know, dear Rodya,
that Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry
him. I hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has been
arranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved
with me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that we
could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you. And you
could not have judged all the facts without being on the spot. This
was how it happened. He is already of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr
Petrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who
has been very active in bringing the match about. It began with his
expressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance. He was
properly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent
us a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a
speedy and decided answer. He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry
to get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him. At first,
of course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quickly
and unexpectedly. We thought and talked it over the whole day. He is a
well-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the government
and has already made his fortune. It is true that he is forty-five years
old, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be
thought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable and
presentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited.
But possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight.
And beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will
do, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if
there is anything you do not like in him at first sight. I give you this
warning, although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impression
upon you. Moreover, in order to understand any man one must be
deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas,
which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards. And Pyotr
Petrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man.
At his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, but
still he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions â€˜of our
most rising generationâ€™ and he is an opponent of all prejudices. He
said a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to be
listened to, but this is scarcely a vice. I, of course, understood very
little of it, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man
of great education, he is clever and seems to be good-natured. You know
your sisterâ€™s character, Rodya. She is a resolute, sensible, patient and
generous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as I know very well.
Of course, there is no great love either on his side, or on hers, but
Dounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make
it her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her
happiness his care. Of that we have no good reason to doubt, though it
must be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste. Besides he
is a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself, that
his own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is with
him. And as for some defects of character, for some habits and even
certain differences of opinion--which indeed are inevitable even in
the happiest marriages--Dounia has said that, as regards all that, she
relies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, and
that she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their future
relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one. He struck me,
for instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come
from his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is. For
instance, at his second visit, after he had received Douniaâ€™s consent,
in the course of conversation, he declared that before making
Douniaâ€™s acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl of
good reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced
poverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his
wife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her
benefactor. I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely
than I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only
remember the meaning. And, besides, it was obviously not said of design,
but slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwards
to correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike
me as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia. But Dounia was
vexed, and answered that â€˜words are not deeds,â€™ and that, of course, is
perfectly true. Dounia did not sleep all night before she made up
her mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she got out of bed and was
walking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down before
the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me
that she had decided.
â€œI have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for
Petersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to open
a legal bureau. He has been occupied for many years in conducting civil
and commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an important
case. He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case before
the Senate. So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in
every way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day
you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that
your future is marked out and assured for you. Oh, if only this comes to
pass! This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a
providential blessing. Dounia is dreaming of nothing else. We have even
ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch.
He was cautious in his answer, and said that, of course, as he could not
get on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary to
a relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for the
duties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted!) but then
he expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave
you time for work at his office. The matter dropped for the time, but
Dounia is thinking of nothing else now. She has been in a sort of fever
for the last few days, and has already made a regular plan for
your becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr
Petrovitchâ€™s business, which might well be, seeing that you are a
student of law. I am in complete agreement with her, Rodya, and share
all her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability of
realising them. And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitchâ€™s evasiveness, very
natural at present (since he does not know you), Dounia is firmly
persuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her
future husband; this she is reckoning upon. Of course we are careful
not to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch,
especially of your becoming his partner. He is a practical man and might
take this very coldly, it might all seem to him simply a day-dream. Nor
has either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have
of his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken
of it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself,
later on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of
himself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily since
you may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, and
receive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by your
own work. Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree
with her. And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, that
is, because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when
you first meet him. When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about
you, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing
him close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own
opinion when he makes your acquaintance. Do you know, my precious
Rodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with Pyotr
Petrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old-womanish,
fancies) I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than with
them, after the wedding. I am convinced that he will be generous and
delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter
for the future, and if he has said nothing about it hitherto, it is
simply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse. I have
noticed more than once in my life that husbands donâ€™t quite get on with
their mothers-in-law, and I donâ€™t want to be the least bit in anyoneâ€™s
way, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, so
long as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and
Dounia. If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the most
joyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter:
know then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a
very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of
almost three years! It is settled _for certain_ that Dounia and I are to
set off for Petersburg, exactly when I donâ€™t know, but very, very soon,
possibly in a week. It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us
know when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg. To suit his
own arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible,
even before the fast of Our Lady, if it could be managed, or if that is
too soon to be ready, immediately after. Oh, with what happiness I shall
press you to my heart! Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought
of seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry
Pyotr Petrovitch for that alone. She is an angel! She is not writing
anything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much,
so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, for
a few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting
herself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses. But
although we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send you as much
money as I can in a day or two. Now that everyone has heard that Dounia
is to marry Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has suddenly improved and I know
that Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubles
on the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able to send
you twenty-five or even thirty roubles. I would send you more, but I am
uneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch has
been so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, that
is to say, he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big
trunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his), we
must reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg, where we
canâ€™t be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days. But
we have calculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny, and we see
that the journey will not cost very much. It is only ninety versts from
us to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we
know, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travel
quite comfortably third class. So that I may very likely be able to send
to you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles. But enough; I have covered
two sheets already and there is no space left for more; our whole
history, but so many events have happened! And now, my precious Rodya,
I embrace you and send you a motherâ€™s blessing till we meet. Love Dounia
your sister, Rodya; love her as she loves you and understand that she
loves you beyond everything, more than herself. She is an angel and you,
Rodya, you are everything to us--our one hope, our one consolation. If
only you are happy, we shall be happy. Do you still say your prayers,
Rodya, and believe in the mercy of our Creator and our Redeemer? I am
afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of
infidelity that is abroad to-day; If it is so, I pray for you. Remember,
dear boy, how in your childhood, when your father was living, you used
to lisp your prayers at my knee, and how happy we all were in those
days. Good-bye, till we meet then--I embrace you warmly, warmly, with
many kisses.
â€œYours till death,
NA
Almost from the first, while he read the letter, Raskolnikovâ€™s face was
wet with tears; but when he finished it, his face was pale and distorted
and a bitter, wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips. He laid his
head down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered, pondered a long
time. His heart was beating violently, and his brain was in a turmoil.
At last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was
like a cupboard or a box. His eyes and his mind craved for space. He
took up his hat and went out, this time without dread of meeting
anyone; he had forgotten his dread. He turned in the direction of the
Vassilyevsky Ostrov, walking along Vassilyevsky Prospect, as though
hastening on some business, but he walked, as his habit was, without
noticing his way, muttering and even speaking aloud to himself, to the
astonishment of the passers-by. Many of them took him to be drunk.
CHAPTER IV
His motherâ€™s letter had been a torture to him, but as regards the chief
fact in it, he had felt not one momentâ€™s hesitation, even whilst he was
reading the letter. The essential question was settled, and irrevocably
settled, in his mind: â€œNever such a marriage while I am alive and
NA
to himself, with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his
decision. â€œNo, mother, no, Dounia, you wonâ€™t deceive me! and then they
apologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision without
me! I dare say! They imagine it is arranged now and canâ€™t be broken
off; but we will see whether it can or not! A magnificent excuse:
â€˜Pyotr Petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be in
post-haste, almost by express.â€™ No, Dounia, I see it all and I know what
you want to say to me; and I know too what you were thinking about, when
you walked up and down all night, and what your prayers were like before
the Holy Mother of Kazan who stands in motherâ€™s bedroom. Bitter is
the ascent to Golgotha.... Hm... so it is finally settled; you have
determined to marry a sensible business man, Avdotya Romanovna, one
who has a fortune (has _already_ made his fortune, that is so much
more solid and impressive) a man who holds two government posts and who
shares the ideas of our most rising generation, as mother writes, and
who _seems_ to be kind, as Dounia herself observes. That _seems_ beats
everything! And that very Dounia for that very â€˜_seems_â€™ is marrying
him! Splendid! splendid!
â€œ... But I should like to know why mother has written to me about â€˜our
most rising generationâ€™? Simply as a descriptive touch, or with the idea
of prepossessing me in favour of Mr. Luzhin? Oh, the cunning of them!
I should like to know one thing more: how far they were open with one
another that day and night and all this time since? Was it all put into
_words_, or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart
and in their minds, so that there was no need to speak of it aloud, and
better not to speak of it. Most likely it was partly like that, from
motherâ€™s letter itâ€™s evident: he struck her as rude _a little_, and
mother in her simplicity took her observations to Dounia. And she was
sure to be vexed and â€˜answered her angrily.â€™ I should think so! Who
would not be angered when it was quite clear without any naÃ¯ve questions
and when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it. And why
does she write to me, â€˜love Dounia, Rodya, and she loves you more than
herselfâ€™? Has she a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her daughter
to her son? â€˜You are our one comfort, you are everything to us.â€™ Oh,
NA
His bitterness grew more and more intense, and if he had happened to
meet Mr. Luzhin at the moment, he might have murdered him.
NA
chased each other in his brain, â€œit is true that â€˜it needs time and care
to get to know a man,â€™ but there is no mistake about Mr. Luzhin. The
chief thing is he is â€˜a man of business and _seems_ kind,â€™ that was
something, wasnâ€™t it, to send the bags and big box for them! A kind man,
no doubt after that! But his _bride_ and her mother are to drive in a
peasantâ€™s cart covered with sacking (I know, I have been driven in
it). No matter! It is only ninety versts and then they can â€˜travel very
comfortably, third class,â€™ for a thousand versts! Quite right, too. One
must cut oneâ€™s coat according to oneâ€™s cloth, but what about you, Mr.
Luzhin? She is your bride.... And you must be aware that her mother has
to raise money on her pension for the journey. To be sure itâ€™s a matter
of business, a partnership for mutual benefit, with equal shares and
expenses;--food and drink provided, but pay for your tobacco. The
business man has got the better of them, too. The luggage will cost less
than their fares and very likely go for nothing. How is it that they
donâ€™t both see all that, or is it that they donâ€™t want to see? And
they are pleased, pleased! And to think that this is only the first
blossoming, and that the real fruits are to come! But what really
matters is not the stinginess, is not the meanness, but the _tone_
of the whole thing. For that will be the tone after marriage, itâ€™s a
foretaste of it. And mother too, why should she be so lavish? What will
she have by the time she gets to Petersburg? Three silver roubles or
two â€˜paper onesâ€™ as _she_ says.... that old woman... hm. What does
she expect to live upon in Petersburg afterwards? She has her reasons
already for guessing that she _could not_ live with Dounia after the
marriage, even for the first few months. The good man has no doubt let
slip something on that subject also, though mother would deny it: â€˜I
shall refuse,â€™ says she. On whom is she reckoning then? Is she counting
on what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension when
Afanasy Ivanovitchâ€™s debt is paid? She knits woollen shawls and
embroiders cuffs, ruining her old eyes. And all her shawls donâ€™t add
more than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty, I know
that. So she is building all her hopes all the time on Mr. Luzhinâ€™s
generosity; â€˜he will offer it of himself, he will press it on me.â€™
You may wait a long time for that! Thatâ€™s how it always is with these
Schilleresque noble hearts; till the last moment every goose is a swan
with them, till the last moment, they hope for the best and will see
nothing wrong, and although they have an inkling of the other side of
the picture, yet they wonâ€™t face the truth till they are forced to; the
very thought of it makes them shiver; they thrust the truth away with
both hands, until the man they deck out in false colours puts a foolâ€™s
cap on them with his own hands. I should like to know whether Mr. Luzhin
has any orders of merit; I bet he has the Anna in his buttonhole and
that he puts it on when he goes to dine with contractors or merchants.
He will be sure to have it for his wedding, too! Enough of him, confound
him!
â€œWell,... mother I donâ€™t wonder at, itâ€™s like her, God bless her, but
how could Dounia? Dounia darling, as though I did not know you! You were
nearly twenty when I saw you last: I understood you then. Mother writes
that â€˜Dounia can put up with a great deal.â€™ I know that very well. I
knew that two years and a half ago, and for the last two and a half
years I have been thinking about it, thinking of just that, that â€˜Dounia
can put up with a great deal.â€™ If she could put up with Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov
and all the rest of it, she certainly can put up with a great deal. And
now mother and she have taken it into their heads that she can put up
with Mr. Luzhin, who propounds the theory of the superiority of
wives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husbandâ€™s
bounty--who propounds it, too, almost at the first interview. Granted
that he â€˜let it slip,â€™ though he is a sensible man, (yet maybe it
was not a slip at all, but he meant to make himself clear as soon as
possible) but Dounia, Dounia? She understands the man, of course, but
she will have to live with the man. Why! sheâ€™d live on black bread
and water, she would not sell her soul, she would not barter her moral
freedom for comfort; she would not barter it for all Schleswig-Holstein,
much less Mr. Luzhinâ€™s money. No, Dounia was not that sort when I knew
her and... she is still the same, of course! Yes, thereâ€™s no denying,
the SvidrigaÃ¯lovs are a bitter pill! Itâ€™s a bitter thing to spend oneâ€™s
life a governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles, but I know
she would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a Lett with a German
master than degrade her soul, and her moral dignity, by binding herself
for ever to a man whom she does not respect and with whom she has
nothing in common--for her own advantage. And if Mr. Luzhin had been of
unalloyed gold, or one huge diamond, she would never have consented to
become his legal concubine. Why is she consenting then? Whatâ€™s the
point of it? Whatâ€™s the answer? Itâ€™s clear enough: for herself, for her
comfort, to save her life she would not sell herself, but for someone
else she is doing it! For one she loves, for one she adores, she will
sell herself! Thatâ€™s what it all amounts to; for her brother, for her
mother, she will sell herself! She will sell everything! In such cases,
â€˜we overcome our moral feeling if necessary,â€™ freedom, peace, conscience
even, all, all are brought into the market. Let my life go, if only my
dear ones may be happy! More than that, we become casuists, we learn
to be Jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves, we can
persuade ourselves that it is oneâ€™s duty for a good object. Thatâ€™s just
like us, itâ€™s as clear as daylight. Itâ€™s clear that Rodion Romanovitch
Raskolnikov is the central figure in the business, and no one else. Oh,
yes, she can ensure his happiness, keep him in the university, make him
a partner in the office, make his whole future secure; perhaps he may
even be a rich man later on, prosperous, respected, and may even end his
life a famous man! But my mother? Itâ€™s all Rodya, precious Rodya, her
first born! For such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter! Oh,
loving, over-partial hearts! Why, for his sake we would not shrink even
from Soniaâ€™s fate. Sonia, Sonia Marmeladov, the eternal victim so long
as the world lasts. Have you taken the measure of your sacrifice, both
of you? Is it right? Can you bear it? Is it any use? Is there sense in
it? And let me tell you, Dounia, Soniaâ€™s life is no worse than life with
Mr. Luzhin. â€˜There can be no question of love,â€™ mother writes. And what
if there can be no respect either, if on the contrary there is aversion,
contempt, repulsion, what then? So you will have to â€˜keep up your
appearance,â€™ too. Is not that so? Do you understand what that smartness
means? Do you understand that the Luzhin smartness is just the same
thing as Soniaâ€™s and may be worse, viler, baser, because in your case,
Dounia, itâ€™s a bargain for luxuries, after all, but with Sonia itâ€™s
simply a question of starvation. It has to be paid for, it has to be
paid for, Dounia, this smartness. And what if itâ€™s more than you can
bear afterwards, if you regret it? The bitterness, the misery, the
curses, the tears hidden from all the world, for you are not a Marfa
Petrovna. And how will your mother feel then? Even now she is uneasy,
she is worried, but then, when she sees it all clearly? And I? Yes,
indeed, what have you taken me for? I wonâ€™t have your sacrifice, Dounia,
I wonâ€™t have it, mother! It shall not be, so long as I am alive, it
NA
He suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still.
â€œIt shall not be? But what are you going to do to prevent it? Youâ€™ll
forbid it? And what right have you? What can you promise them on your
side to give you such a right? Your whole life, your whole future, you
will devote to them _when you have finished your studies and obtained a
post_? Yes, we have heard all that before, and thatâ€™s all _words_, but
now? Now something must be done, now, do you understand that? And
what are you doing now? You are living upon them. They borrow on their
hundred roubles pension. They borrow from the SvidrigaÃ¯lovs. How are
you going to save them from SvidrigaÃ¯lovs, from Afanasy Ivanovitch
Vahrushin, oh, future millionaire Zeus who would arrange their lives for
them? In another ten years? In another ten years, mother will be blind
with knitting shawls, maybe with weeping too. She will be worn to a
shadow with fasting; and my sister? Imagine for a moment what may have
become of your sister in ten years? What may happen to her during those

So he tortured himself, fretting himself with such questions, and
finding a kind of enjoyment in it. And yet all these questions were not
new ones suddenly confronting him, they were old familiar aches. It was
long since they had first begun to grip and rend his heart. Long, long
ago his present anguish had its first beginnings; it had waxed and
gathered strength, it had matured and concentrated, until it had taken
the form of a fearful, frenzied and fantastic question, which tortured
his heart and mind, clamouring insistently for an answer. Now his
motherâ€™s letter had burst on him like a thunderclap. It was clear
that he must not now suffer passively, worrying himself over unsolved
questions, but that he must do something, do it at once, and do it
quickly. Anyway he must decide on something, or else...

NA
He gave a sudden start; another thought, that he had had yesterday,
slipped back into his mind. But he did not start at the thought
recurring to him, for he knew, he had _felt beforehand_, that it must
come back, he was expecting it; besides it was not only yesterdayâ€™s
thought. The difference was that a month ago, yesterday even, the
thought was a mere dream: but now... now it appeared not a dream at all,
it had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape, and he suddenly
became aware of this himself.... He felt a hammering in his head, and
there was a darkness before his eyes.
He looked round hurriedly, he was searching for something. He wanted
to sit down and was looking for a seat; he was walking along the K----
Boulevard. There was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him. He
walked towards it as fast he could; but on the way he met with a little
adventure which absorbed all his attention. Looking for the seat, he had
noticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him, but at first
he took no more notice of her than of other objects that crossed his
path. It had happened to him many times going home not to notice the
road by which he was going, and he was accustomed to walk like that. But
there was at first sight something so strange about the woman in front
of him, that gradually his attention was riveted upon her, at first
reluctantly and, as it were, resentfully, and then more and more
intently. He felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was so
strange about the woman. In the first place, she appeared to be a girl
quite young, and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with
no parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in an absurd way. She had
on a dress of some light silky material, but put on strangely awry, not
properly hooked up, and torn open at the top of the skirt, close to the
waist: a great piece was rent and hanging loose. A little kerchief was
flung about her bare throat, but lay slanting on one side. The girl was
walking unsteadily, too, stumbling and staggering from side to side. She
drew Raskolnikovâ€™s whole attention at last. He overtook the girl at the
seat, but, on reaching it, she dropped down on it, in the corner;
she let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes,
apparently in extreme exhaustion. Looking at her closely, he saw at once
that she was completely drunk. It was a strange and shocking sight. He
could hardly believe that he was not mistaken. He saw before him the
face of a quite young, fair-haired girl--sixteen, perhaps not more than
fifteen, years old, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy looking
and, as it were, swollen. The girl seemed hardly to know what she was
doing; she crossed one leg over the other, lifting it indecorously, and
showed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street.
Raskolnikov did not sit down, but he felt unwilling to leave her,
and stood facing her in perplexity. This boulevard was never much
frequented; and now, at two oâ€™clock, in the stifling heat, it was quite
deserted. And yet on the further side of the boulevard, about fifteen
paces away, a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement. He,
too, would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object
of his own. He, too, had probably seen her in the distance and had
followed her, but found Raskolnikov in his way. He looked angrily at
him, though he tried to escape his notice, and stood impatiently biding
his time, till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away. His
intentions were unmistakable. The gentleman was a plump, thickly-set
man, about thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red lips and
moustaches. Raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sudden longing to insult
this fat dandy in some way. He left the girl for a moment and walked
towards the gentleman.
NA

NA
astonishment.
NA
NA
He raised his cane. Raskolnikov rushed at him with his fists, without
reflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men like
himself. But at that instant someone seized him from behind, and a
police constable stood between them.
â€œThatâ€™s enough, gentlemen, no fighting, please, in a public place. What
NA
rags.
Raskolnikov looked at him intently. He had a straight-forward, sensible,
soldierly face, with grey moustaches and whiskers.
NA
NA
added, addressing the gentleman, â€œcome along, I have something to show
NA
And taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat.
â€œLook here, hopelessly drunk, and she has just come down the boulevard.
There is no telling who and what she is, she does not look like a
professional. Itâ€™s more likely she has been given drink and deceived
somewhere... for the first time... you understand? and theyâ€™ve put her
out into the street like that. Look at the way her dress is torn, and
the way it has been put on: she has been dressed by somebody, she has
not dressed herself, and dressed by unpractised hands, by a manâ€™s hands;
thatâ€™s evident. And now look there: I donâ€™t know that dandy with whom I
was going to fight, I see him for the first time, but he, too, has seen
her on the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she is doing, and now
he is very eager to get hold of her, to get her away somewhere while she
is in this state... thatâ€™s certain, believe me, I am not wrong. I saw
him myself watching her and following her, but I prevented him, and he
is just waiting for me to go away. Now he has walked away a little, and
is standing still, pretending to make a cigarette.... Think how can we

The policeman saw it all in a flash. The stout gentleman was easy to
understand, he turned to consider the girl. The policeman bent over to
examine her more closely, and his face worked with genuine compassion.

hand.

seemed a strange figure to him: dressed in rags and handing him money!

â€œAh, the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays, God have
mercy on us! An innocent creature like that, drunk already! She has been
deceived, thatâ€™s a sure thing. See how her dress has been torn too....
Ah, the vice one sees nowadays! And as likely as not she belongs to
gentlefolk too, poor ones maybe.... There are many like that nowadays.

once more.
Perhaps he had daughters growing up like that, â€œlooking like ladies and

Raskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him. The gentleman heard him,
and seemed about to fly into a rage again, but thought better of it, and
confined himself to a contemptuous look. He then walked slowly another
ten paces away and again halted.
NA
â€œif only sheâ€™d tell us where to take her, but as it is.... Missy, hey,
NA
She opened her eyes fully all of a sudden, looked at him intently, as
though realising something, got up from the seat and walked away in the
direction from which she had come. â€œOh shameful wretches, they wonâ€™t let
NA
staggering as before. The dandy followed her, but along another avenue,
keeping his eye on her.
NA
resolutely, and he set off after them.
NA
At that moment something seemed to sting Raskolnikov; in an instant a
complete revulsion of feeling came over him.
NA
The latter turned round.
â€œLet them be! What is it to do with you? Let her go! Let him amuse
NA
The policeman was bewildered, and stared at him open-eyed. Raskolnikov
laughed.
NA
walked after the dandy and the girl, probably taking Raskolnikov for a
madman or something even worse.
NA
when he was left alone. â€œWell, let him take as much from the other
fellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end. And why did I
want to interfere? Is it for me to help? Have I any right to help? Let
them devour each other alive--what is to me? How did I dare to give him
NA
In spite of those strange words he felt very wretched. He sat down on
the deserted seat. His thoughts strayed aimlessly.... He found it hard
to fix his mind on anything at that moment. He longed to forget himself
altogether, to forget everything, and then to wake up and begin life
anew....
NA
sat--â€œShe will come to herself and weep, and then her mother will find
out.... She will give her a beating, a horrible, shameful beating and
then maybe, turn her out of doors.... And even if she does not, the
Darya Frantsovnas will get wind of it, and the girl will soon be
slipping out on the sly here and there. Then there will be the hospital
directly (thatâ€™s always the luck of those girls with respectable
mothers, who go wrong on the sly) and then... again the hospital...
drink... the taverns... and more hospital, in two or three years--a
wreck, and her life over at eighteen or nineteen.... Have not I seen
cases like that? And how have they been brought to it? Why, theyâ€™ve all
come to it like that. Ugh! But what does it matter? Thatâ€™s as it should
be, they tell us. A certain percentage, they tell us, must every year
go... that way... to the devil, I suppose, so that the rest may remain
chaste, and not be interfered with. A percentage! What splendid words
they have; they are so scientific, so consolatory.... Once youâ€™ve said
â€˜percentageâ€™ thereâ€™s nothing more to worry about. If we had any other
word... maybe we might feel more uneasy.... But what if Dounia were one
of the percentage! Of another one if not that one?
NA
something. As soon as I had read the letter I came out.... I was going
to Vassilyevsky Ostrov, to Razumihin. Thatâ€™s what it was... now I
remember. What for, though? And what put the idea of going to Razumihin
NA
He wondered at himself. Razumihin was one of his old comrades at the
university. It was remarkable that Raskolnikov had hardly any friends at
the university; he kept aloof from everyone, went to see no one, and did
not welcome anyone who came to see him, and indeed everyone soon gave
him up. He took no part in the studentsâ€™ gatherings, amusements or
conversations. He worked with great intensity without sparing himself,
and he was respected for this, but no one liked him. He was very poor,
and there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him, as though
he were keeping something to himself. He seemed to some of his comrades
to look down upon them all as children, as though he were superior in
development, knowledge and convictions, as though their beliefs and
interests were beneath him.
With Razumihin he had got on, or, at least, he was more unreserved and
communicative with him. Indeed it was impossible to be on any other
terms with Razumihin. He was an exceptionally good-humoured and candid
youth, good-natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth and
dignity lay concealed under that simplicity. The better of his comrades
understood this, and all were fond of him. He was extremely intelligent,
though he was certainly rather a simpleton at times. He was of striking
appearance--tall, thin, blackhaired and always badly shaved. He was
sometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength.
One night, when out in a festive company, he had with one blow laid
a gigantic policeman on his back. There was no limit to his drinking
powers, but he could abstain from drink altogether; he sometimes went
too far in his pranks; but he could do without pranks altogether.
Another thing striking about Razumihin, no failure distressed him, and
it seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him. He
could lodge anywhere, and bear the extremes of cold and hunger. He was
very poor, and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of
one sort or another. He knew of no end of resources by which to earn
money. He spent one whole winter without lighting his stove, and used to
declare that he liked it better, because one slept more soundly in
the cold. For the present he, too, had been obliged to give up the
university, but it was only for a time, and he was working with all his
might to save enough to return to his studies again. Raskolnikov had
not been to see him for the last four months, and Razumihin did not even
know his address. About two months before, they had met in the street,
but Raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that
he might not be observed. And though Razumihin noticed him, he passed
him by, as he did not want to annoy him.
CHAPTER V
â€œOf course, Iâ€™ve been meaning lately to go to Razumihinâ€™s to ask for

â€œbut what help can he be to me now? Suppose he gets me lessons, suppose
he shares his last farthing with me, if he has any farthings, so that

earn? Thatâ€™s not what I want now. Itâ€™s really absurd for me to go to

The question why he was now going to Razumihin agitated him even more
than he was himself aware; he kept uneasily seeking for some sinister
significance in this apparently ordinary action.

He pondered and rubbed his forehead, and, strange to say, after long
musing, suddenly, as if it were spontaneously and by chance, a fantastic
thought came into his head.

but... not now. I shall go to him... on the next day after It, when It

seat, and went off almost at a run; he meant to turn back, homewards,
but the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing;
in that hole, in that awful little cupboard of his, all _this_ had for a
month past been growing up in him; and he walked on at random.
His nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel
shivering; in spite of the heat he felt cold. With a kind of effort he
began almost unconsciously, from some inner craving, to stare at all
the objects before him, as though looking for something to distract his
attention; but he did not succeed, and kept dropping every moment into
brooding. When with a start he lifted his head again and looked round,
he forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he
was going. In this way he walked right across Vassilyevsky Ostrov, came
out on to the Lesser Neva, crossed the bridge and turned towards the
islands. The greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary
eyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him in
and weighed upon him. Here there were no taverns, no stifling closeness,
no stench. But soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid
irritability. Sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer
villa standing among green foliage, he gazed through the fence, he saw
in the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies,
and children running in the gardens. The flowers especially caught his
attention; he gazed at them longer than at anything. He was met, too, by
luxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback; he watched them
with curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from
his sight. Once he stood still and counted his money; he found he had
thirty copecks. â€œTwenty to the policeman, three to Nastasya for the
letter, so I must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovs
NA
soon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket.
He recalled it on passing an eating-house or tavern, and felt that he
was hungry.... Going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a
pie of some sort. He finished eating it as he walked away. It was a long
while since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once,
though he only drank a wineglassful. His legs felt suddenly heavy and
a great drowsiness came upon him. He turned homewards, but reaching
Petrovsky Ostrov he stopped completely exhausted, turned off the road
into the bushes, sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep.
In a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a singular
actuality, vividness, and extraordinary semblance of reality. At times
monstrous images are created, but the setting and the whole picture are
so truth-like and filled with details so delicate, so unexpectedly, but
so artistically consistent, that the dreamer, were he an artist like
Pushkin or Turgenev even, could never have invented them in the waking
state. Such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a
powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system.
Raskolnikov had a fearful dream. He dreamt he was back in his childhood
in the little town of his birth. He was a child about seven years old,
walking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday. It
was a grey and heavy day, the country was exactly as he remembered it;
indeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in
memory. The little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand, not
even a willow near it; only in the far distance, a copse lay, a dark
blur on the very edge of the horizon. A few paces beyond the last market
garden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him a
feeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with his father.
There was always a crowd there, always shouting, laughter and abuse,
hideous hoarse singing and often fighting. Drunken and horrible-looking
figures were hanging about the tavern. He used to cling close to his
father, trembling all over when he met them. Near the tavern the road
became a dusty track, the dust of which was always black. It was a
winding road, and about a hundred paces further on, it turned to the
right to the graveyard. In the middle of the graveyard stood a stone
church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three
times a year with his father and mother, when a service was held in
memory of his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he had never
seen. On these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a
table napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in
the shape of a cross. He loved that church, the old-fashioned, unadorned
ikons and the old priest with the shaking head. Near his grandmotherâ€™s
grave, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave of his younger
brother who had died at six months old. He did not remember him at all,
but he had been told about his little brother, and whenever he visited
the graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and
to bow down and kiss the little grave. And now he dreamt that he was
walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; he
was holding his fatherâ€™s hand and looking with dread at the tavern. A
peculiar circumstance attracted his attention: there seemed to be
some kind of festivity going on, there were crowds of gaily dressed
townspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts,
all singing and all more or less drunk. Near the entrance of the tavern
stood a cart, but a strange cart. It was one of those big carts usually
drawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy
goods. He always liked looking at those great cart-horses, with their
long manes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfect
mountain with no appearance of effort, as though it were easier going
with a load than without it. But now, strange to say, in the shafts of
such a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of those peasantsâ€™
nags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load
of wood or hay, especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in
a rut. And the peasants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes even
about the nose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them that
he almost cried, and his mother always used to take him away from the
window. All of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting, singing
and the balalaÃ¯ka, and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken
peasants came out, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over
their shoulders.

But at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the
crowd.

They all clambered into Mikolkaâ€™s cart, laughing and making jokes. Six
men got in and there was still room for more. They hauled in a fat,
rosy-cheeked woman. She was dressed in red cotton, in a pointed, beaded
headdress and thick leather shoes; she was cracking nuts and laughing.
The crowd round them was laughing too and indeed, how could they help
laughing? That wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a
gallop! Two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to

but far from galloping, could scarcely move forward; she struggled with
her legs, gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which
were showered upon her like hail. The laughter in the cart and in the
crowd was redoubled, but Mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed
the mare, as though he supposed she really could gallop.

All at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything: the mare,
roused by the shower of blows, began feebly kicking. Even the old man
could not help smiling. To think of a wretched little beast like that
trying to kick!
Two lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the mare to beat her
about the ribs. One ran each side.

cart joined in a riotous song, jingling a tambourine and whistling. The
woman went on cracking nuts and laughing.
... He ran beside the mare, ran in front of her, saw her being whipped
across the eyes, right in the eyes! He was crying, he felt choking, his
tears were streaming. One of the men gave him a cut with the whip across
the face, he did not feel it. Wringing his hands and screaming, he
rushed up to the grey-headed old man with the grey beard, who was
shaking his head in disapproval. One woman seized him by the hand and
would have taken him away, but he tore himself from her and ran back to
the mare. She was almost at the last gasp, but began kicking once more.

And Mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time
on the spine of the luckless mare. She sank back on her haunches, but
lurched forward and tugged forward with all her force, tugged first on
one side and then on the other, trying to move the cart. But the six
whips were attacking her in all directions, and the shaft was raised
again and fell upon her a third time, then a fourth, with heavy measured
blows. Mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow.

they could come across--whips, sticks, poles, and ran to the dying

crowbar. The mare stretched out her head, drew a long breath and died.

shouting in the crowd.
But the poor boy, beside himself, made his way, screaming, through the
crowd to the sorrel nag, put his arms round her bleeding dead head and
kissed it, kissed the eyes and kissed the lips.... Then he jumped up and
flew in a frenzy with his little fists out at Mikolka. At that instant
his father, who had been running after him, snatched him up and carried
him out of the crowd.

He rose to his feet, looked round in wonder as though surprised at
finding himself in this place, and went towards the bridge. He was pale,
his eyes glowed, he was exhausted in every limb, but he seemed suddenly
to breathe more easily. He felt he had cast off that fearful burden that
had so long been weighing upon him, and all at once there was a sense
NA
NA
Crossing the bridge, he gazed quietly and calmly at the Neva, at the
glowing red sun setting in the glowing sky. In spite of his weakness he
was not conscious of fatigue. It was as though an abscess that had been
forming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken. Freedom,
freedom! He was free from that spell, that sorcery, that obsession!
Later on, when he recalled that time and all that happened to him during
those days, minute by minute, point by point, he was superstitiously
impressed by one circumstance, which, though in itself not very
exceptional, always seemed to him afterwards the predestined
turning-point of his fate. He could never understand and explain to
himself why, when he was tired and worn out, when it would have been
more convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way,
he had returned by the Hay Market where he had no need to go. It was
obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way, though not much so. It
is true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home without
noticing what streets he passed through. But why, he was always asking
himself, why had such an important, such a decisive and at the same time
such an absolutely chance meeting happened in the Hay Market (where he
had moreover no reason to go) at the very hour, the very minute of his
life when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances
in which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive
influence on his whole destiny? As though it had been lying in wait for
him on purpose!
It was about nine oâ€™clock when he crossed the Hay Market. At the tables
and the barrows, at the booths and the shops, all the market people were
closing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their
wares and, like their customers, were going home. Rag pickers and
costermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirty
and stinking courtyards of the Hay Market. Raskolnikov particularly
liked this place and the neighbouring alleys, when he wandered aimlessly
in the streets. Here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention,
and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people. At
the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out
with tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc. They, too, had got up to
go home, but were lingering in conversation with a friend, who had just
come up to them. This friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or, as everyone
called her, Lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, Alyona
Ivanovna, whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his
watch and make his _experiment_.... He already knew all about Lizaveta
and she knew him a little too. She was a single woman of about
thirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic. She was
a complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister, who
made her work day and night, and even beat her. She was standing with
a bundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly and
doubtfully. They were talking of something with special warmth. The
moment Raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strange
sensation as it were of intense astonishment, though there was nothing
astonishing about this meeting.

huckster was saying aloud. â€œCome round to-morrow about seven. They will

Raskolnikov had just passed and heard no more. He passed softly,
unnoticed, trying not to miss a word. His first amazement was followed
by a thrill of horror, like a shiver running down his spine. He had
learnt, he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt, that the next day at
seven oâ€™clock Lizaveta, the old womanâ€™s sister and only companion, would
be away from home and that therefore at seven oâ€™clock precisely the old
woman _would be left alone_.
He was only a few steps from his lodging. He went in like a man
condemned to death. He thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking;
but he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom
of thought, no will, and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably
decided.
Certainly, if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity, he
could not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan
than that which had just presented itself. In any case, it would have
been difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty, with
greater exactness and less risk, and without dangerous inquiries and
investigations, that next day at a certain time an old woman, on whose
life an attempt was contemplated, would be at home and entirely alone.
CHAPTER VI
Later on Raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his
wife had invited Lizaveta. It was a very ordinary matter and there was
nothing exceptional about it. A family who had come to the town and been
reduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes, all
womenâ€™s things. As the things would have fetched little in the market,
they were looking for a dealer. This was Lizavetaâ€™s business. She
undertook such jobs and was frequently employed, as she was very honest
and always fixed a fair price and stuck to it. She spoke as a rule
little and, as we have said already, she was very submissive and timid.
But Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late. The traces of
superstition remained in him long after, and were almost ineradicable.
And in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see something
strange and mysterious, as it were, the presence of some peculiar
influences and coincidences. In the previous winter a student he knew
called Pokorev, who had left for Harkov, had chanced in conversation to
give him the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case he
might want to pawn anything. For a long while he did not go to her, for
he had lessons and managed to get along somehow. Six weeks ago he had
remembered the address; he had two articles that could be pawned: his
fatherâ€™s old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones,
a present from his sister at parting. He decided to take the ring. When
he found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her
at the first glance, though he knew nothing special about her. He got
two roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way
home. He asked for tea, sat down and sank into deep thought. A strange
idea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg, and very, very
much absorbed him.
Almost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student, whom he
did not know and had never seen, and with him a young officer. They had
played a game of billiards and began drinking tea. All at once he heard
the student mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and
give him her address. This of itself seemed strange to Raskolnikov; he
had just come from her and here at once he heard her name. Of course
it was a chance, but he could not shake off a very extraordinary
impression, and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him;
the student began telling his friend various details about Alyona
Ivanovna.
NA
as rich as a Jew, she can give you five thousand roubles at a time and
she is not above taking a pledge for a rouble. Lots of our fellows have
NA
And he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was, how if you
were only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost; how she
gave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven
percent a month on it and so on. The student chattered on, saying
that she had a sister Lizaveta, whom the wretched little creature was
continually beating, and kept in complete bondage like a small child,
though Lizaveta was at least six feet high.
NA
They began talking about Lizaveta. The student spoke about her with a
peculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened
with great interest and asked him to send Lizaveta to do some mending
for him. Raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about
her. Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half-sister,
being the child of a different mother. She was thirty-five. She worked
day and night for her sister, and besides doing the cooking and the
washing, she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister
all she earned. She did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind
without her sisterâ€™s permission. The old woman had already made her
will, and Lizaveta knew of it, and by this will she would not get a
farthing; nothing but the movables, chairs and so on; all the money was
left to a monastery in the province of N----, that prayers might be
said for her in perpetuity. Lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister,
unmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance, remarkably tall with long
feet that looked as if they were bent outwards. She always wore battered
goatskin shoes, and was clean in her person. What the student expressed
most surprise and amusement about was the fact that Lizaveta was
continually with child.
NA
â€œYes, she is so dark-skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up, but
you know she is not at all hideous. She has such a good-natured face
and eyes. Strikingly so. And the proof of it is that lots of people are
attracted by her. She is such a soft, gentle creature, ready to put up
with anything, always willing, willing to do anything. And her smile is
NA
NA
â€œFrom her queerness. No, Iâ€™ll tell you what. I could kill that damned
old woman and make off with her money, I assure you, without the

laughed again while Raskolnikov shuddered. How strange it was!
NA
â€œI was joking of course, but look here; on one side we have a stupid,
senseless, worthless, spiteful, ailing, horrid old woman, not simply
useless but doing actual mischief, who has not an idea what she is
living for herself, and who will die in a day or two in any case. You

NA
companion attentively.
â€œWell, listen then. On the other side, fresh young lives thrown away for
want of help and by thousands, on every side! A hundred thousand good
deeds could be done and helped, on that old womanâ€™s money which will be
buried in a monastery! Hundreds, thousands perhaps, might be set on the
right path; dozens of families saved from destitution, from ruin, from
vice, from the Lock hospitals--and all with her money. Kill her, take
her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of
humanity and the good of all. What do you think, would not one tiny
crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds? For one life thousands
would be saved from corruption and decay. One death, and a hundred lives
in exchange--itâ€™s simple arithmetic! Besides, what value has the life of
that sickly, stupid, ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence!
No more than the life of a louse, of a black-beetle, less in fact
because the old woman is doing harm. She is wearing out the lives of
others; the other day she bit Lizavetaâ€™s finger out of spite; it almost

â€œOh, well, brother, but we have to correct and direct nature, and, but
for that, we should drown in an ocean of prejudice. But for that,

conscience;--but the point is, what do we mean by them? Stay, I have

Raskolnikov was violently agitated. Of course, it was all ordinary
youthful talk and thought, such as he had often heard before in
different forms and on different themes. But why had he happened to hear
such a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brain
was just conceiving... _the very same ideas_? And why, just at the
moment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the old
woman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her? This
coincidence always seemed strange to him. This trivial talk in a tavern
had an immense influence on him in his later action; as though there had
really been in it something preordained, some guiding hint....
*****
On returning from the Hay Market he flung himself on the sofa and sat
for a whole hour without stirring. Meanwhile it got dark; he had no
candle and, indeed, it did not occur to him to light up. He could never
recollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time. At
last he was conscious of his former fever and shivering, and he realised
with relief that he could lie down on the sofa. Soon heavy, leaden sleep
came over him, as it were crushing him.
He slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming. Nastasya,
coming into his room at ten oâ€™clock the next morning, had difficulty
in rousing him. She brought him in tea and bread. The tea was again the
second brew and again in her own tea-pot.

He got up with an effort. His head ached, he stood up, took a turn in

He got up, and sat down again, but said nothing and stared at the floor.

And he motioned her out.
She remained a little longer, looked at him with compassion and went
out.
A few minutes afterwards, he raised his eyes and looked for a long while
at the tea and the soup. Then he took the bread, took up a spoon and
began to eat.
He ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it were
mechanically. His head ached less. After his meal he stretched himself
on the sofa again, but now he could not sleep; he lay without stirring,
with his face in the pillow. He was haunted by day-dreams and such
strange day-dreams; in one, that kept recurring, he fancied that he was
in Africa, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis. The caravan was resting,
the camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood all around in a
complete circle; all the party were at dinner. But he was drinking water
from a spring which flowed gurgling close by. And it was so cool, it was
wonderful, wonderful, blue, cold water running among the parti-coloured
stones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like
gold.... Suddenly he heard a clock strike. He started, roused himself,
raised his head, looked out of the window, and seeing how late it was,
suddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the
sofa. He crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and began
listening on the staircase. His heart beat terribly. But all was quiet
on the stairs as if everyone was asleep.... It seemed to him strange and
monstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the
previous day and had done nothing, had prepared nothing yet.... And
meanwhile perhaps it had struck six. And his drowsiness and stupefaction
were followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it were distracted
haste. But the preparations to be made were few. He concentrated all his
energies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing; and his heart
kept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe. First he had
to make a noose and sew it into his overcoat--a work of a moment. He
rummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away
under it, a worn out, old unwashed shirt. From its rags he tore a long
strip, a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long. He folded
this strip in two, took off his wide, strong summer overcoat of some
stout cotton material (his only outer garment) and began sewing the two
ends of the rag on the inside, under the left armhole. His hands shook
as he sewed, but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside
when he put the coat on again. The needle and thread he had got ready
long before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper. As for the
noose, it was a very ingenious device of his own; the noose was intended
for the axe. It was impossible for him to carry the axe through the
street in his hands. And if hidden under his coat he would still have
had to support it with his hand, which would have been noticeable. Now
he had only to put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hang
quietly under his arm on the inside. Putting his hand in his coat
pocket, he could hold the end of the handle all the way, so that it did
not swing; and as the coat was very full, a regular sack in fact, it
could not be seen from outside that he was holding something with the
hand that was in the pocket. This noose, too, he had designed a
fortnight before.
When he had finished with this, he thrust his hand into a little opening
between his sofa and the floor, fumbled in the left corner and drew out
the _pledge_, which he had got ready long before and hidden there. This
pledge was, however, only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and
thickness of a silver cigarette case. He picked up this piece of wood
in one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of
a workshop. Afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece
of iron, which he had also picked up at the same time in the street.
Putting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood,
he fastened them very firmly, crossing and re-crossing the thread round
them; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and
tied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it. This
was in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time, while
she was trying to undo the knot, and so to gain a moment. The iron strip
was added to give weight, so that the woman might not guess the first
NA
him beforehand under the sofa. He had only just got the pledge out when
he heard someone suddenly about in the yard.
NA
NA
He rushed to the door, listened, caught up his hat and began to descend
his thirteen steps cautiously, noiselessly, like a cat. He had still the
most important thing to do--to steal the axe from the kitchen. That the
deed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago. He had also a
pocket pruning-knife, but he could not rely on the knife and still less
on his own strength, and so resolved finally on the axe. We may note in
passing, one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by
him in the matter; they had one strange characteristic: the more final
they were, the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in
his eyes. In spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he never for
a single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his
plans.
And, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything to the least point
could have been considered and finally settled, and no uncertainty of
any kind had remained, he would, it seems, have renounced it all
as something absurd, monstrous and impossible. But a whole mass of
unsettled points and uncertainties remained. As for getting the axe,
that trifling business cost him no anxiety, for nothing could be easier.
Nastasya was continually out of the house, especially in the evenings;
she would run in to the neighbours or to a shop, and always left the
door ajar. It was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her
about. And so, when the time came, he would only have to go quietly into
the kitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later (when everything
was over) go in and put it back again. But these were doubtful points.
Supposing he returned an hour later to put it back, and Nastasya had
come back and was on the spot. He would of course have to go by and wait
till she went out again. But supposing she were in the meantime to miss
the axe, look for it, make an outcry--that would mean suspicion or at
least grounds for suspicion.
But those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider, and
indeed he had no time. He was thinking of the chief point, and put off
trifling details, until _he could believe in it all_. But that seemed
utterly unattainable. So it seemed to himself at least. He could not
imagine, for instance, that he would sometime leave off thinking, get
up and simply go there.... Even his late experiment (i.e. his visit with
the object of a final survey of the place) was simply an attempt at
an experiment, far from being the real thing, as though one should say
NA
had broken down and had run away cursing, in a frenzy with himself.
Meanwhile it would seem, as regards the moral question, that his
analysis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, and he
could not find rational objections in himself. But in the last resort
he simply ceased to believe in himself, and doggedly, slavishly sought
arguments in all directions, fumbling for them, as though someone were
forcing and drawing him to it.
At first--long before indeed--he had been much occupied with one
question; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily
detected, and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces? He
had come gradually to many different and curious conclusions, and in his
opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility
of concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself. Almost every
criminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a
childish and phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when prudence
and caution are most essential. It was his conviction that this eclipse
of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease,
developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the
perpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment
of the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to the
individual case, and then passed off like any other disease. The
question whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether the
crime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of
the nature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide.
When he reached these conclusions, he decided that in his own case there
could not be such a morbid reaction, that his reason and will would
remain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design, for the
NA
process by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion; we have
run too far ahead already.... We may add only that the practical, purely
material difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his
mind. â€œOne has but to keep all oneâ€™s will-power and reason to deal
with them, and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has
NA
this preparation had never been begun. His final decisions were what he
came to trust least, and when the hour struck, it all came to pass quite
differently, as it were accidentally and unexpectedly.
One trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before he had even
left the staircase. When he reached the landladyâ€™s kitchen, the door
of which was open as usual, he glanced cautiously in to see whether, in
Nastasyaâ€™s absence, the landlady herself was there, or if not, whether
the door to her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out when
he went in for the axe. But what was his amazement when he suddenly
saw that Nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen, but was occupied
there, taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line. Seeing
him, she left off hanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at him
all the time he was passing. He turned away his eyes, and walked past as
though he noticed nothing. But it was the end of everything; he had not
the axe! He was overwhelmed.
NA
made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment!
NA
He was crushed and even humiliated. He could have laughed at himself in
his anger.... A dull animal rage boiled within him.
He stood hesitating in the gateway. To go into the street, to go a walk
for appearanceâ€™ sake was revolting; to go back to his room, even more
NA
standing aimlessly in the gateway, just opposite the porterâ€™s little
dark room, which was also open. Suddenly he started. From the porterâ€™s
room, two paces away from him, something shining under the bench to the
right caught his eye.... He looked about him--nobody. He approached the
room on tiptoe, went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called
the porter. â€œYes, not at home! Somewhere near though, in the yard, for
NA
it out from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks of wood;
at once, before going out, he made it fast in the noose, he thrust both
hands into his pockets and went out of the room; no one had noticed him!
NA
This chance raised his spirits extraordinarily.
He walked along quietly and sedately, without hurry, to avoid awakening
suspicion. He scarcely looked at the passers-by, tried to escape looking
at their faces at all, and to be as little noticeable as possible.
Suddenly he thought of his hat. â€œGood heavens! I had the money the day
NA
from the bottom of his soul.
Glancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop, he saw by a clock on
the wall that it was ten minutes past seven. He had to make haste and at
the same time to go someway round, so as to approach the house from the
other side....
When he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, he had sometimes
thought that he would be very much afraid. But he was not very much
afraid now, was not afraid at all, indeed. His mind was even occupied
by irrelevant matters, but by nothing for long. As he passed the Yusupov
garden, he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great
fountains, and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all
the squares. By degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer
garden were extended to the field of Mars, and perhaps joined to the
garden of the Mihailovsky Palace, it would be a splendid thing and a
great benefit to the town. Then he was interested by the question why
in all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity, but in some
peculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there
are no gardens nor fountains; where there is most dirt and smell and all
sorts of nastiness. Then his own walks through the Hay Market came back
NA
NA
â€œSo probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that
NA
like lightning; he made haste to dismiss this thought.... And by now
he was near; here was the house, here was the gate. Suddenly a clock
somewhere struck once. â€œWhat! can it be half-past seven? Impossible, it
NA
Luckily for him, everything went well again at the gates. At that very
moment, as though expressly for his benefit, a huge waggon of hay had
just driven in at the gate, completely screening him as he passed under
the gateway, and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into
the yard, before he had slipped in a flash to the right. On the other
side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling; but no one
noticed him and no one met him. Many windows looking into that huge
quadrangular yard were open at that moment, but he did not raise his
head--he had not the strength to. The staircase leading to the old
womanâ€™s room was close by, just on the right of the gateway. He was
already on the stairs....
Drawing a breath, pressing his hand against his throbbing heart, and
once more feeling for the axe and setting it straight, he began softly
and cautiously ascending the stairs, listening every minute. But the
stairs, too, were quite deserted; all the doors were shut; he met no
one. One flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were
at work in it, but they did not glance at him. He stood still, thought
a minute and went on. â€œOf course it would be better if they had not been

And there was the fourth storey, here was the door, here was the
flat opposite, the empty one. The flat underneath the old womanâ€™s was
apparently empty also; the visiting card nailed on the door had been
torn off--they had gone away!... He was out of breath. For one instant

he listened again on the staircase, listened long and intently...
then looked about him for the last time, pulled himself together, drew

But his heart did not leave off. On the contrary, as though to spite
him, it throbbed more and more violently. He could stand it no longer,
he slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang. Half a minute later he
rang again, more loudly.
No answer. To go on ringing was useless and out of place. The old woman
was, of course, at home, but she was suspicious and alone. He had some
knowledge of her habits... and once more he put his ear to the door.
Either his senses were peculiarly keen (which it is difficult to
suppose), or the sound was really very distinct. Anyway, he suddenly
heard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and the
rustle of a skirt at the very door. Someone was standing stealthily
close to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly
listening within, and seemed to have her ear to the door.... He moved
a little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have
the appearance of hiding, then rang a third time, but quietly, soberly,
and without impatience, Recalling it afterwards, that moment stood out
in his mind vividly, distinctly, for ever; he could not make out how he
had had such cunning, for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and
he was almost unconscious of his body.... An instant later he heard the
latch unfastened.

The door was as before opened a tiny crack, and again two sharp and
suspicious eyes stared at him out of the darkness. Then Raskolnikov lost
his head and nearly made a great mistake.
Fearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone, and not
hoping that the sight of him would disarm her suspicions, he took
hold of the door and drew it towards him to prevent the old woman from
attempting to shut it again. Seeing this she did not pull the door back,
but she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out with
it on to the stairs. Seeing that she was standing in the doorway not
allowing him to pass, he advanced straight upon her. She stepped back
in alarm, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak and stared
with open eyes at him.
NA
his voice would not obey him, it broke and shook. â€œI have come... I have
NA
And leaving her, he passed straight into the room uninvited. The old
woman ran after him; her tongue was unloosed.
NA
â€œWhy, Alyona Ivanovna, you know me... Raskolnikov... here, I brought you
NA
The old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge, but at once stared in
the eyes of her uninvited visitor. She looked intently, maliciously and
mistrustfully. A minute passed; he even fancied something like a sneer
in her eyes, as though she had already guessed everything. He felt that
he was losing his head, that he was almost frightened, so frightened
that if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half
minute, he thought he would have run away from her.
NA
also with malice. â€œTake it if you like, if not Iâ€™ll go elsewhere, I am
NA
He had not even thought of saying this, but it was suddenly said of
itself. The old woman recovered herself, and her visitorâ€™s resolute tone
evidently restored her confidence.
NA
looking at the pledge.
NA
She held out her hand.
â€œBut how pale you are, to be sure... and your hands are trembling too?
NA
NA
NA
His strength was failing him again. But his answer sounded like the
truth; the old woman took the pledge.
NA
weighing the pledge in her hand.
NA
NA
Trying to untie the string and turning to the window, to the light (all
her windows were shut, in spite of the stifling heat), she left
him altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him. He
unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose, but did not yet
take it out altogether, simply holding it in his right hand under the
coat. His hands were fearfully weak, he felt them every moment growing
more numb and more wooden. He was afraid he would let the axe slip and
fall.... A sudden giddiness came over him.
NA
vexation and moved towards him.
He had not a minute more to lose. He pulled the axe quite out, swung
it with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost without
effort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her head. He
seemed not to use his own strength in this. But as soon as he had once
brought the axe down, his strength returned to him.
The old woman was as always bareheaded. Her thin, light hair, streaked
with grey, thickly smeared with grease, was plaited in a ratâ€™s tail and
fastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck.
As she was so short, the blow fell on the very top of her skull. She
cried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on the
floor, raising her hands to her head. In one hand she still held â€œthe
NA
and on the same spot. The blood gushed as from an overturned glass, the
body fell back. He stepped back, let it fall, and at once bent over her
face; she was dead. Her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets,
the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.
He laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her
pocket (trying to avoid the streaming body)--the same right-hand pocket
from which she had taken the key on his last visit. He was in full
possession of his faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but his
hands were still trembling. He remembered afterwards that he had been
particularly collected and careful, trying all the time not to get
smeared with blood.... He pulled out the keys at once, they were all,
as before, in one bunch on a steel ring. He ran at once into the bedroom
with them. It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images.
Against the other wall stood a big bed, very clean and covered with
a silk patchwork wadded quilt. Against a third wall was a chest of
drawers. Strange to say, so soon as he began to fit the keys into the
chest, so soon as he heard their jingling, a convulsive shudder passed
over him. He suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go
away. But that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back.
He positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terrifying idea
occurred to his mind. He suddenly fancied that the old woman might be
still alive and might recover her senses. Leaving the keys in the chest,
he ran back to the body, snatched up the axe and lifted it once more
over the old woman, but did not bring it down. There was no doubt that
she was dead. Bending down and examining her again more closely, he saw
clearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side. He
was about to feel it with his finger, but drew back his hand and indeed
it was evident without that. Meanwhile there was a perfect pool of
blood. All at once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at it, but
the string was strong and did not snap and besides, it was soaked
with blood. He tried to pull it out from the front of the dress, but
something held it and prevented its coming. In his impatience he raised
the axe again to cut the string from above on the body, but did not
dare, and with difficulty, smearing his hand and the axe in the blood,
after two minutesâ€™ hurried effort, he cut the string and took it off
without touching the body with the axe; he was not mistaken--it was a
purse. On the string were two crosses, one of Cyprus wood and one of
copper, and an image in silver filigree, and with them a small greasy
chamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring. The purse was stuffed
very full; Raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it,
flung the crosses on the old womanâ€™s body and rushed back into the
bedroom, this time taking the axe with him.
He was in terrible haste, he snatched the keys, and began trying them
again. But he was unsuccessful. They would not fit in the locks. It
was not so much that his hands were shaking, but that he kept making
mistakes; though he saw for instance that a key was not the right one
and would not fit, still he tried to put it in. Suddenly he remembered
and realised that the big key with the deep notches, which was hanging
there with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest of
drawers (on his last visit this had struck him), but to some strong box,
and that everything perhaps was hidden in that box. He left the chest
of drawers, and at once felt under the bedstead, knowing that old
women usually keep boxes under their beds. And so it was; there was a
good-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with an arched
lid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails. The notched
key fitted at once and unlocked it. At the top, under a white sheet, was
a coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress,
then a shawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below but
clothes. The first thing he did was to wipe his blood-stained hands on
NA
 the thought passed through his mind; then he suddenly came to himself.
NA
But no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from
under the fur coat. He made haste to turn them all over. There turned
out to be various articles made of gold among the clothes--probably
all pledges, unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed--bracelets, chains,
ear-rings, pins and such things. Some were in cases, others simply
wrapped in newspaper, carefully and exactly folded, and tied round with
tape. Without any delay, he began filling up the pockets of his trousers
and overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases; but he
had not time to take many....
He suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay. He stopped
short and was still as death. But all was quiet, so it must have been
his fancy. All at once he heard distinctly a faint cry, as though
someone had uttered a low broken moan. Then again dead silence for
a minute or two. He sat squatting on his heels by the box and waited
holding his breath. Suddenly he jumped up, seized the axe and ran out of
the bedroom.
In the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms.
She was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister, white as a sheet
and seeming not to have the strength to cry out. Seeing him run out
of the bedroom, she began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf, a
shudder ran down her face; she lifted her hand, opened her mouth, but
still did not scream. She began slowly backing away from him into the
corner, staring intently, persistently at him, but still uttered no
sound, as though she could not get breath to scream. He rushed at her
with the axe; her mouth twitched piteously, as one sees babiesâ€™ mouths,
when they begin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens them
and are on the point of screaming. And this hapless Lizaveta was so
simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not
even raise a hand to guard her face, though that was the most necessary
and natural action at the moment, for the axe was raised over her face.
She only put up her empty left hand, but not to her face, slowly holding
it out before her as though motioning him away. The axe fell with the
sharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the
head. She fell heavily at once. Raskolnikov completely lost his head,
snatching up her bundle, dropped it again and ran into the entry.
Fear gained more and more mastery over him, especially after this
second, quite unexpected murder. He longed to run away from the place
as fast as possible. And if at that moment he had been capable of seeing
and reasoning more correctly, if he had been able to realise all the
difficulties of his position, the hopelessness, the hideousness and the
absurdity of it, if he could have understood how many obstacles and,
perhaps, crimes he had still to overcome or to commit, to get out of
that place and to make his way home, it is very possible that he would
have flung up everything, and would have gone to give himself up, and
not from fear, but from simple horror and loathing of what he had
done. The feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grew
stronger every minute. He would not now have gone to the box or even
into the room for anything in the world.
But a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had begun by degrees to take
possession of him; at moments he forgot himself, or rather, forgot what
was of importance, and caught at trifles. Glancing, however, into the
kitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he bethought
him of washing his hands and the axe. His hands were sticky with blood.
He dropped the axe with the blade in the water, snatched a piece of soap
that lay in a broken saucer on the window, and began washing his hands
in the bucket. When they were clean, he took out the axe, washed the
blade and spent a long time, about three minutes, washing the wood where
there were spots of blood rubbing them with soap. Then he wiped it all
with some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen and
then he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window.
There was no trace left on it, only the wood was still damp. He
carefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat. Then as far as was
possible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he looked over his overcoat,
his trousers and his boots. At the first glance there seemed to be
nothing but stains on the boots. He wetted the rag and rubbed the boots.
But he knew he was not looking thoroughly, that there might be something
quite noticeable that he was overlooking. He stood in the middle of the
room, lost in thought. Dark agonising ideas rose in his mind--the idea
that he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning,
of protecting himself, that he ought perhaps to be doing something
NA
NA
awaited him such as he had never known before.
He stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes: the door, the outer
door from the stairs, at which he had not long before waited and rung,
was standing unfastened and at least six inches open. No lock, no bolt,
all the time, all that time! The old woman had not shut it after him
perhaps as a precaution. But, good God! Why, he had seen Lizaveta
afterwards! And how could he, how could he have failed to reflect that
she must have come in somehow! She could not have come through the wall!
He dashed to the door and fastened the latch.
NA
He unfastened the latch, opened the door and began listening on the
staircase.
He listened a long time. Somewhere far away, it might be in the gateway,
two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting, quarrelling and scolding.
NA
though suddenly cut off; they had separated. He was meaning to go out,
but suddenly, on the floor below, a door was noisily opened and someone
began going downstairs humming a tune. â€œHow is it they all make such
NA
waited. At last all was still, not a soul stirring. He was just taking a
step towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps.
The steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the stairs, but
he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he
began for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming _there_,
to the fourth floor, to the old woman. Why? Were the sounds somehow
peculiar, significant? The steps were heavy, even and unhurried. Now
_he_ had passed the first floor, now he was mounting higher, it was
growing more and more distinct! He could hear his heavy breathing. And
now the third storey had been reached. Coming here! And it seemed to
him all at once that he was turned to stone, that it was like a dream
in which one is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and is
rooted to the spot and cannot even move oneâ€™s arms.
At last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor, he suddenly
started, and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the
flat and closing the door behind him. Then he took the hook and softly,
noiselessly, fixed it in the catch. Instinct helped him. When he had
done this, he crouched holding his breath, by the door. The unknown
visitor was by now also at the door. They were now standing opposite one
another, as he had just before been standing with the old woman, when
the door divided them and he was listening.
NA
Raskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his hand. It seemed like a dream
indeed. The visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly.
As soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to be aware of
something moving in the room. For some seconds he listened quite
seriously. The unknown rang again, waited and suddenly tugged violently
and impatiently at the handle of the door. Raskolnikov gazed in horror
at the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected every
minute that the fastening would be pulled out. It certainly did seem
possible, so violently was he shaking it. He was tempted to hold the
fastening, but _he_ might be aware of it. A giddiness came over him
NA
began to speak and he recovered himself at once.
NA
thick voice, â€œHey, Alyona Ivanovna, old witch! Lizaveta Ivanovna, hey,
NA
And again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen times at
the bell. He must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate
acquaintance.
At this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, on the
stairs. Someone else was approaching. Raskolnikov had not heard them at
first.
NA
cheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, who still went on
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhy! The day before yesterday I beat you three times running at
NA
NA
â€œSo they are not at home? Thatâ€™s queer. Itâ€™s awfully stupid though.
NA
NA
â€œWell, what can we do? Go back, I suppose, Aie--aie! And I was hoping to
NA
â€œWe must give it up, of course, but what did she fix this time for? The
old witch fixed the time for me to come herself. Itâ€™s out of my way.
And where the devil she can have got to, I canâ€™t make out. She sits here
from yearâ€™s end to yearâ€™s end, the old hag; her legs are bad and yet
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œHm.... Damn it all!... We might ask.... But you know she never does go
NA
And he once more tugged at the door-handle.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThat shows itâ€™s not locked, but fastened with the hook! Do you hear how
NA
NA
â€œWhy, donâ€™t you see? That proves that one of them is at home. If they
were all out, they would have locked the door from the outside with the
key and not with the hook from inside. There, do you hear how the hook
is clanking? To fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home,
donâ€™t you see. So there they are sitting inside and donâ€™t open the
NA
NA
NA
NA
something wrong.... Here, youâ€™ve been ringing and pulling at the door
NA
NA
NA
NA
Both were going down.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œIâ€™m studying the law you see! Itâ€™s evident, e-vi-dent thereâ€™s something
NA
Koch remained. Once more he softly touched the bell which gave one
tinkle, then gently, as though reflecting and looking about him, began
touching the door-handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once
more that it was only fastened by the hook. Then puffing and panting he
bent down and began looking at the keyhole: but the key was in the lock
on the inside and so nothing could be seen.
Raskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe. He was in a sort of
delirium. He was even making ready to fight when they should come in.
While they were knocking and talking together, the idea several times
occurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through the
door. Now and then he was tempted to swear at them, to jeer at them,
NA
that flashed through his mind.
NA
another--no one came. Koch began to be restless.
NA
sentry duty, he, too, went down, hurrying and thumping with his heavy
boots on the stairs. The steps died away.
NA
Raskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door--there was no sound.
Abruptly, without any thought at all, he went out, closing the door as
thoroughly as he could, and went downstairs.
He had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice
below--where could he go! There was nowhere to hide. He was just going
back to the flat.
NA
Somebody dashed out of a flat below, shouting, and rather fell than ran
down the stairs, bawling at the top of his voice.
NA
The shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from the yard; all was
still. But at the same instant several men talking loud and fast began
noisily mounting the stairs. There were three or four of them. He
NA
Filled with despair he went straight to meet them, feeling â€œcome what
NA
lost too; they would remember him. They were approaching; they were only
a flight from him--and suddenly deliverance! A few steps from him on the
right, there was an empty flat with the door wide open, the flat on the
second floor where the painters had been at work, and which, as though
for his benefit, they had just left. It was they, no doubt, who had just
run down, shouting. The floor had only just been painted, in the middle
of the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes. In one
instant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wall
and only in the nick of time; they had already reached the landing.
Then they turned and went on up to the fourth floor, talking loudly. He
waited, went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs.
No one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway. He passed quickly through
the gateway and turned to the left in the street.
He knew, he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the
flat, that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked, as
the door had just been fastened, that by now they were looking at the
bodies, that before another minute had passed they would guess and
completely realise that the murderer had just been there, and had
succeeded in hiding somewhere, slipping by them and escaping. They would
guess most likely that he had been in the empty flat, while they were
going upstairs. And meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much, though
the next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away. â€œShould he
slip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street? No,
hopeless! Should he fling away the axe? Should he take a cab? Hopeless,
NA
At last he reached the turning. He turned down it more dead than alive.
Here he was half way to safety, and he understood it; it was less risky
because there was a great crowd of people, and he was lost in it like a
grain of sand. But all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could
scarcely move. Perspiration ran down him in drops, his neck was all wet.
NA
on the canal bank.
He was only dimly conscious of himself now, and the farther he went the
worse it was. He remembered however, that on coming out on to the canal
bank, he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more
conspicuous, and he had thought of turning back. Though he was almost
falling from fatigue, he went a long way round so as to get home from
quite a different direction.
He was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his
house! He was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe.
And yet he had a very grave problem before him, to put it back and to
escape observation as far as possible in doing so. He was of course
incapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to
restore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in somebodyâ€™s yard. But
it all happened fortunately, the door of the porterâ€™s room was closed
but not locked, so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at
home. But he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he
walked straight to the door and opened it. If the porter had asked him,
NA
again the porter was not at home, and he succeeded in putting the axe
back under the bench, and even covering it with the chunk of wood as
before. He met no one, not a soul, afterwards on the way to his room;
the landladyâ€™s door was shut. When he was in his room, he flung himself
on the sofa just as he was--he did not sleep, but sank into blank
forgetfulness. If anyone had come into his room then, he would have
jumped up at once and screamed. Scraps and shreds of thoughts were
simply swarming in his brain, but he could not catch at one, he could
not rest on one, in spite of all his efforts....
PART II
CHAPTER I
So he lay a very long while. Now and then he seemed to wake up, and at
such moments he noticed that it was far into the night, but it did not
occur to him to get up. At last he noticed that it was beginning to get
light. He was lying on his back, still dazed from his recent oblivion.
Fearful, despairing cries rose shrilly from the street, sounds which he
heard every night, indeed, under his window after two oâ€™clock. They woke
him up now.
NA
NA
pulled him from the sofa.
NA
He sat down on the sofa--and instantly recollected everything! All at
once, in one flash, he recollected everything.
For the first moment he thought he was going mad. A dreadful chill came
over him; but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in
his sleep. Now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering, so that his
teeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking. He opened the door and
began listening--everything in the house was asleep. With amazement he
gazed at himself and everything in the room around him, wondering how he
could have come in the night before without fastening the door, and have
flung himself on the sofa without undressing, without even taking his
hat off. It had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his pillow.
â€œIf anyone had come in, what would he have thought? That Iâ€™m drunk
NA
He rushed to the window. There was light enough, and he began hurriedly
looking himself all over from head to foot, all his clothes; were there
no traces? But there was no doing it like that; shivering with cold, he
began taking off everything and looking over again. He turned everything
over to the last threads and rags, and mistrusting himself, went through
his search three times.
But there seemed to be nothing, no trace, except in one place, where
some thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge
of his trousers. He picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed
threads. There seemed to be nothing more.
Suddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out of
the old womanâ€™s box were still in his pockets! He had not thought till
then of taking them out and hiding them! He had not even thought of them
while he was examining his clothes! What next? Instantly he rushed
to take them out and fling them on the table. When he had pulled out
everything, and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there was
nothing left, he carried the whole heap to the corner. The paper had
come off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters. He began
stuffing all the things into the hole under the paper: â€œTheyâ€™re in! All
NA
gazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever. Suddenly
NA
â€œwhatâ€™s the matter with me? Is that hidden? Is that the way to hide
NA
He had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide. He had only thought of
money, and so had not prepared a hiding-place.
NA
NA
He sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by another
unbearable fit of shivering. Mechanically he drew from a chair beside
him his old studentâ€™s winter coat, which was still warm though almost in
rags, covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and
delirium. He lost consciousness.
Not more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time,
and at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again.
â€œHow could I go to sleep again with nothing done? Yes, yes; I have not
taken the loop off the armhole! I forgot it, forgot a thing like that!
NA
He pulled off the noose, hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bits
among his linen under the pillow.
â€œPieces of torn linen couldnâ€™t rouse suspicion, whatever happened; I
NA
of the room, and with painful concentration he fell to gazing about
him again, at the floor and everywhere, trying to make sure he had not
forgotten anything. The conviction that all his faculties, even memory,
and the simplest power of reflection were failing him, began to be an
insufferable torture.
â€œSurely it isnâ€™t beginning already! Surely it isnâ€™t my punishment coming
NA
The frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on the
floor in the middle of the room, where anyone coming in would see them!
NA
Then a strange idea entered his head; that, perhaps, all his clothes
were covered with blood, that, perhaps, there were a great many
stains, but that he did not see them, did not notice them because
his perceptions were failing, were going to pieces... his reason was
clouded.... Suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on the
purse too. â€œAh! Then there must be blood on the pocket too, for I put
NA
In a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and, yes!--there were
traces, stains on the lining of the pocket!
â€œSo my reason has not quite deserted me, so I still have some sense and
NA
a deep sigh of relief; â€œitâ€™s simply the weakness of fever, a momentâ€™s
NA
trousers. At that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot; on the
sock which poked out from the boot, he fancied there were traces! He
flung off his boots; â€œtraces indeed! The tip of the sock was soaked with
NA
NA
He gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the middle of the
room.
â€œIn the stove? But they would ransack the stove first of all. Burn them?
But what can I burn them with? There are no matches even. No, better
NA
repeated, sitting down on the sofa again, â€œand at once, this minute,
NA
But his head sank on the pillow instead. Again the unbearable icy
shivering came over him; again he drew his coat over him.
And for a long while, for some hours, he was haunted by the impulse to
â€œgo off somewhere at once, this moment, and fling it all away, so that
NA
he tried to rise from the sofa, but could not.
He was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his door.
NA
Nastasya, banging with her fist on the door. â€œFor whole days together
heâ€™s snoring here like a dog! A dog he is too. Open I tell you. Itâ€™s
NA
NA
NA
He jumped up and sat on the sofa. The beating of his heart was a
positive pain.
NA
bolting himself in! As if he were worth stealing! Open, you stupid, wake
NA
â€œWhat do they want? Why the porter? Allâ€™s discovered. Resist or open?
NA
He half rose, stooped forward and unlatched the door.
His room was so small that he could undo the latch without leaving the
bed. Yes; the porter and Nastasya were standing there.
Nastasya stared at him in a strange way. He glanced with a defiant and
desperate air at the porter, who without a word held out a grey folded
paper sealed with bottle-wax.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The man looked at him attentively, looked round the room and turned to
go away.
NA
The porter turned his head for a moment. â€œHeâ€™s been in a fever since
NA
Raskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands, without
NA
seeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa. â€œYouâ€™re ill, and
NA
He looked; in his right hand he held the shreds he had cut from his
trousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket. So he had been asleep
with them in his hand. Afterwards reflecting upon it, he remembered that
half waking up in his fever, he had grasped all this tightly in his hand
and so fallen asleep again.
â€œLook at the rags heâ€™s collected and sleeps with them, as though he has
NA
And Nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle.
Instantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed his
eyes intently upon her. Far as he was from being capable of rational
reflection at that moment, he felt that no one would behave like that
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
She followed the porter out.
At once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags.
â€œThere are stains, but not very noticeable; all covered with dirt,
and rubbed and already discoloured. No one who had no suspicion could
distinguish anything. Nastasya from a distance could not have noticed,
NA
reading; he was a long while reading, before he understood. It was an
ordinary summons from the district police-station to appear that day at

He was flinging himself on his knees to pray, but broke into
laughter--not at the idea of prayer, but at himself.
He began, hurriedly dressing. â€œIf Iâ€™m lost, I am lost, I donâ€™t care!

NA
But no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing
and horror. He pulled it off, but reflecting that he had no other socks,
he picked it up and put it on again--and again he laughed.
â€œThatâ€™s all conventional, thatâ€™s all relative, merely a way of looking

mind, while he was shuddering all over, â€œthere, Iâ€™ve got it on! I have

But his laughter was quickly followed by despair.

On the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the things just as

In the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop of rain had
fallen all those days. Again dust, bricks and mortar, again the stench
from the shops and pot-houses, again the drunken men, the Finnish
pedlars and half-broken-down cabs. The sun shone straight in his eyes,
so that it hurt him to look out of them, and he felt his head going
round--as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the
street on a bright sunny day.
When he reached the turning into _the_ street, in an agony of
trepidation he looked down it... at _the_ house... and at once averted
his eyes.
NA
near the police-station.
The police-station was about a quarter of a mile off. It had lately been
moved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house. He had been once
for a moment in the old office but long ago. Turning in at the gateway,
he saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with
a book in his hand. â€œA house-porter, no doubt; so then, the office is
NA
to ask questions of anyone.
NA
he reached the fourth floor.
The staircase was steep, narrow and all sloppy with dirty water. The
kitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almost
the whole day. So there was a fearful smell and heat. The staircase
was crowded with porters going up and down with their books under their
arms, policemen, and persons of all sorts and both sexes. The door of
the office, too, stood wide open. Peasants stood waiting within. There,
too, the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of fresh
paint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms.
After waiting a little, he decided to move forward into the next room.
All the rooms were small and low-pitched. A fearful impatience drew him
on and on. No one paid attention to him. In the second room some
clerks sat writing, dressed hardly better than he was, and rather a
queer-looking set. He went up to one of them.
NA
He showed the notice he had received.
NA
NA
The clerk looked at him, but without the slightest interest. He was a
particularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye.
â€œThere would be no getting anything out of him, because he has no
NA
NA
furthest room.
He went into that room--the fourth in order; it was a small room and
packed full of people, rather better dressed than in the outer rooms.
Among them were two ladies. One, poorly dressed in mourning, sat at the
table opposite the chief clerk, writing something at his dictation.
The other, a very stout, buxom woman with a purplish-red, blotchy face,
excessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as a
saucer, was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something.
Raskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk. The latter glanced
NA
mourning.
NA
By degrees he began to regain confidence, he kept urging himself to have
courage and be calm.
â€œSome foolishness, some trifling carelessness, and I may betray myself!
NA
NA
He was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil. He was afraid of losing
his self-control; he tried to catch at something and fix his mind on it,
something quite irrelevant, but he could not succeed in this at all. Yet
the head clerk greatly interested him, he kept hoping to see through him
and guess something from his face.
He was a very young man, about two and twenty, with a dark mobile
face that looked older than his years. He was fashionably dressed and
foppish, with his hair parted in the middle, well combed and pomaded,
and wore a number of rings on his well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chain
on his waistcoat. He said a couple of words in French to a foreigner who
was in the room, and said them fairly correctly.
NA
gaily-dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as though not
venturing to sit down, though there was a chair beside her.
NA
into the chair. Her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated
about the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room. She
smelt of scent. But she was obviously embarrassed at filling half
the room and smelling so strongly of scent; and though her smile was
impudent as well as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness.
The lady in mourning had done at last, and got up. All at once, with
some noise, an officer walked in very jauntily, with a peculiar swing of
his shoulders at each step. He tossed his cockaded cap on the table and
sat down in an easy-chair. The small lady positively skipped from her
seat on seeing him, and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; but the
officer took not the smallest notice of her, and she did not venture to
sit down again in his presence. He was the assistant superintendent. He
had a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his
face, and extremely small features, expressive of nothing much except
a certain insolence. He looked askance and rather indignantly at
Raskolnikov; he was so very badly dressed, and in spite of his
humiliating position, his bearing was by no means in keeping with his
clothes. Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look on
him, so that he felt positively affronted.
NA
fellow was not annihilated by the majesty of his glance.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
And he trembled with joy. He felt sudden intense indescribable relief. A
load was lifted from his back.
NA
assistant superintendent, seeming for some unknown reason more and more

NA
answered loudly over his shoulder. To his own surprise he, too, grew
suddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it. â€œAnd itâ€™s enough that
NA
NA
â€œIâ€™m not shouting, Iâ€™m speaking very quietly, itâ€™s you who are shouting
NA
The assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he
could only splutter inarticulately. He leaped up from his seat.
NA
NA
smoking a cigarette as well as shouting, so you are showing disrespect
NA
He felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this.
The head clerk looked at him with a smile. The angry assistant
superintendent was obviously disconcerted.
NA
â€œKindly make the declaration demanded of you. Show him. Alexandr
Grigorievitch. There is a complaint against you! You donâ€™t pay your
NA
But Raskolnikov was not listening now; he had eagerly clutched at the
paper, in haste to find an explanation. He read it once, and a second
time, and still did not understand.
NA
â€œIt is for the recovery of money on an I O U, a writ. You must
either pay it, with all expenses, costs and so on, or give a written
declaration when you can pay it, and at the same time an undertaking not
to leave the capital without payment, and nor to sell or conceal your
property. The creditor is at liberty to sell your property, and proceed
NA
NA
â€œThatâ€™s not our business. Here, an I O U for a hundred and fifteen
roubles, legally attested, and due for payment, has been brought us
for recovery, given by you to the widow of the assessor Zarnitsyn, nine
months ago, and paid over by the widow Zarnitsyn to one Mr. Tchebarov.
NA
NA
NA
The head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of compassion,
and at the same time with a certain triumph, as at a novice under fire
NA
 But what did he care now for an I O U, for a writ of recovery! Was that
worth worrying about now, was it worth attention even! He stood, he
read, he listened, he answered, he even asked questions himself, but
all mechanically. The triumphant sense of security, of deliverance from
overwhelming danger, that was what filled his whole soul that moment
without thought for the future, without analysis, without suppositions
or surmises, without doubts and without questioning. It was an instant
of full, direct, purely instinctive joy. But at that very moment
something like a thunderstorm took place in the office. The assistant
superintendent, still shaken by Raskolnikovâ€™s disrespect, still fuming
and obviously anxious to keep up his wounded dignity, pounced on the
unfortunate smart lady, who had been gazing at him ever since he came in
with an exceedingly silly smile.
NA
lady in mourning had left the office.) â€œWhat was going on at your house
last night? Eh! A disgrace again, youâ€™re a scandal to the whole street.
Fighting and drinking again. Do you want the house of correction? Why,

NA
The paper fell out of Raskolnikovâ€™s hands, and he looked wildly at the
smart lady who was so unceremoniously treated. But he soon saw what it
meant, and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal. He
listened with pleasure, so that he longed to laugh and laugh... all his
nerves were on edge.
NA
short, for he knew from experience that the enraged assistant could not
be stopped except by force.
As for the smart lady, at first she positively trembled before the
storm. But, strange to say, the more numerous and violent the terms of
abuse became, the more amiable she looked, and the more seductive the
smiles she lavished on the terrible assistant. She moved uneasily, and
curtsied incessantly, waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her
word: and at last she found it.
NA
pattered all at once, like peas dropping, speaking Russian confidently,
though with a strong German accent, â€œand no sort of scandal, and his
honour came drunk, and itâ€™s the whole truth I am telling, Mr. Captain,
and I am not to blame.... Mine is an honourable house, Mr. Captain,
and honourable behaviour, Mr. Captain, and I always, always dislike any
scandal myself. But he came quite tipsy, and asked for three bottles
again, and then he lifted up one leg, and began playing the pianoforte
with one foot, and that is not at all right in an honourable house, and
he _ganz_ broke the piano, and it was very bad manners indeed and I said
so. And he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it. And then
I called the porter, and Karl came, and he took Karl and hit him in the
eye; and he hit Henriette in the eye, too, and gave me five slaps on the
cheek. And it was so ungentlemanly in an honourable house, Mr. Captain,
and I screamed. And he opened the window over the canal, and stood in
the window, squealing like a little pig; it was a disgrace. The idea of
squealing like a little pig at the window into the street! Fie upon him!
And Karl pulled him away from the window by his coat, and it is true,
Mr. Captain, he tore _sein rock_. And then he shouted that _man muss_
pay him fifteen roubles damages. And I did pay him, Mr. Captain, five
roubles for _sein rock_. And he is an ungentlemanly visitor and caused
all the scandal. â€˜I will show you up,â€™ he said, â€˜for I can write to all

â€œYes, Mr. Captain, and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourable

The assistant glanced rapidly at him; the head clerk slightly shook his
head.
â€œ... So I tell you this, most respectable Luise Ivanovna, and I tell it

lock-up, as it is called in polite society. Do you hear? So a literary
man, an author took five roubles for his coat-tail in an â€˜honourable

And he cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov. â€œThere was a scandal
the other day in a restaurant, too. An author had eaten his dinner and
would not pay; â€˜Iâ€™ll write a satire on you,â€™ says he. And there was
another of them on a steamer last week used the most disgraceful
language to the respectable family of a civil councillor, his wife and
daughter. And there was one of them turned out of a confectionerâ€™s shop
the other day. They are like that, authors, literary men, students,
town-criers.... Pfoo! You get along! I shall look in upon you myself one
NA
With hurried deference, Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying in all
directions, and so curtsied herself to the door. But at the door, she
stumbled backwards against a good-looking officer with a fresh, open
face and splendid thick fair whiskers. This was the superintendent of
the district himself, Nikodim Fomitch. Luise Ivanovna made haste
to curtsy almost to the ground, and with mincing little steps, she
fluttered out of the office.

and he walked with some papers to another table, with a jaunty swing of
his shoulders at each step. â€œHere, if you will kindly look: an author,
or a student, has been one at least, does not pay his debts, has given
an I O U, wonâ€™t clear out of his room, and complaints are constantly
being lodged against him, and here he has been pleased to make a protest
against my smoking in his presence! He behaves like a cad himself, and

you, but explosive, explosive! He gets hot, fires up, boils over, and no

at this agreeable banter, though still sulky.
Raskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something exceptionally pleasant
NA
Nikodim Fomitch, â€œwill you enter into my position?... I am ready to
ask pardon, if I have been ill-mannered. I am a poor student, sick
and shattered (shattered was the word he used) by poverty. I am not
studying, because I cannot keep myself now, but I shall get money.... I
have a mother and sister in the province of X. They will send it to
me, and I will pay. My landlady is a good-hearted woman, but she is so
exasperated at my having lost my lessons, and not paying her for the
last four months, that she does not even send up my dinner... and I
donâ€™t understand this I O U at all. She is asking me to pay her on this
NA
NA
NA
 Raskolnikov put in again, still addressing Nikodim Fomitch, but trying
his best to address Ilya Petrovitch also, though the latter persistently
appeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuously
oblivious of him. â€œAllow me to explain that I have been living with her
for nearly three years and at first... at first... for why should I not
confess it, at the very beginning I promised to marry her daughter, it
was a verbal promise, freely given... she was a girl... indeed, I liked
her, though I was not in love with her... a youthful affair in fact...
that is, I mean to say, that my landlady gave me credit freely in those

â€œNobody asks you for these personal details, sir, weâ€™ve no time to

but Raskolnikov stopped him hotly, though he suddenly found it
exceedingly difficult to speak.
â€œBut excuse me, excuse me. It is for me to explain... how it all
happened... In my turn... though I agree with you... it is unnecessary.
But a year ago, the girl died of typhus. I remained lodging there as
before, and when my landlady moved into her present quarters, she said
to me... and in a friendly way... that she had complete trust in me,
but still, would I not give her an I O U for one hundred and fifteen
roubles, all the debt I owed her. She said if only I gave her that,
she would trust me again, as much as I liked, and that she would never,
never--those were her own words--make use of that I O U till I could pay
of myself... and now, when I have lost my lessons and have nothing to

interrupted rudely. â€œYou must give a written undertaking but as for your
love affairs and all these tragic events, we have nothing to do with

NA
the table and also beginning to write. He looked a little ashamed.
NA
NA
NA
Raskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more casually and
contemptuously after his speech, but strange to say he suddenly felt
completely indifferent to anyoneâ€™s opinion, and this revulsion took
place in a flash, in one instant. If he had cared to think a little,
he would have been amazed indeed that he could have talked to them like
that a minute before, forcing his feelings upon them. And where had
those feelings come from? Now if the whole room had been filled, not
with police officers, but with those nearest and dearest to him, he
would not have found one human word for them, so empty was his heart. A
gloomy sensation of agonising, everlasting solitude and remoteness, took
conscious form in his soul. It was not the meanness of his sentimental
effusions before Ilya Petrovitch, nor the meanness of the latterâ€™s
triumph over him that had caused this sudden revulsion in his heart.
Oh, what had he to do now with his own baseness, with all these petty
vanities, officers, German women, debts, police-offices? If he had been
sentenced to be burnt at that moment, he would not have stirred, would
hardly have heard the sentence to the end. Something was happening to
him entirely new, sudden and unknown. It was not that he understood, but
he felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could
never more appeal to these people in the police-office with sentimental
effusions like his recent outburst, or with anything whatever; and that
if they had been his own brothers and sisters and not police-officers,
it would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any
circumstance of life. He had never experienced such a strange and awful
sensation. And what was most agonising--it was more a sensation than a
conception or idea, a direct sensation, the most agonising of all the
sensations he had known in his life.
The head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of declaration,
that he could not pay, that he undertook to do so at a future date, that
he would not leave the town, nor sell his property, and so on.
NA
NA
NA
NA
The head clerk took the paper, and turned to attend to others.
Raskolnikov gave back the pen; but instead of getting up and going away,
he put his elbows on the table and pressed his head in his hands. He
felt as if a nail were being driven into his skull. A strange idea
suddenly occurred to him, to get up at once, to go up to Nikodim
Fomitch, and tell him everything that had happened yesterday, and then
to go with him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the hole
in the corner. The impulse was so strong that he got up from his seat
NA
NA
he stood still, rooted to the spot. Nikodim Fomitch was talking eagerly
with Ilya Petrovitch, and the words reached him:
â€œItâ€™s impossible, theyâ€™ll both be released. To begin with, the whole
story contradicts itself. Why should they have called the porter, if it
had been their doing? To inform against themselves? Or as a blind? No,
that would be too cunning! Besides, Pestryakov, the student, was seen at
the gate by both the porters and a woman as he went in. He was walking
with three friends, who left him only at the gate, and he asked the
porters to direct him, in the presence of the friends. Now, would he
have asked his way if he had been going with such an object? As for
Koch, he spent half an hour at the silversmithâ€™s below, before he went
up to the old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight. Now
NA
â€œBut excuse me, how do you explain this contradiction? They state
themselves that they knocked and the door was locked; yet three minutes
later when they went up with the porter, it turned out the door was

â€œThatâ€™s just it; the murderer must have been there and bolted himself
in; and theyâ€™d have caught him for a certainty if Koch had not been
an ass and gone to look for the porter too. _He_ must have seized the
interval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow. Koch keeps crossing
himself and saying: â€˜If I had been there, he would have jumped out and
killed me with his axe.â€™ He is going to have a thanksgiving service--ha,

the head clerk, who was listening.
NA
NA
Raskolnikov picked up his hat and walked towards the door, but he did
not reach it....
When he recovered consciousness, he found himself sitting in a chair,
supported by someone on the right side, while someone else was standing
on the left, holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water, and
Nikodim Fomitch standing before him, looking intently at him. He got up
from the chair.

Nikodim Fomitch would have made some further protest, but glancing at
the head clerk who was looking very hard at him, he did not speak. There
was a sudden silence. It was strange.

Raskolnikov went out. He caught the sound of eager conversation on his
departure, and above the rest rose the questioning voice of Nikodim
Fomitch. In the street, his faintness passed off completely.

His former terror mastered him completely again.

â€œAnd what if there has been a search already? What if I find them in my

But here was his room. Nothing and no one in it. No one had peeped in.
Even Nastasya had not touched it. But heavens! how could he have left
all those things in the hole?
He rushed to the corner, slipped his hand under the paper, pulled the
things out and lined his pockets with them. There were eight articles in
all: two little boxes with ear-rings or something of the sort, he hardly
looked to see; then four small leather cases. There was a chain, too,
merely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper, that looked
like a decoration.... He put them all in the different pockets of his
overcoat, and the remaining pocket of his trousers, trying to conceal
them as much as possible. He took the purse, too. Then he went out of
his room, leaving the door open. He walked quickly and resolutely, and
though he felt shattered, he had his senses about him. He was afraid of
pursuit, he was afraid that in another half-hour, another quarter of an
hour perhaps, instructions would be issued for his pursuit, and so at
all costs, he must hide all traces before then. He must clear everything
up while he still had some strength, some reasoning power left him....
Where was he to go?
That had long been settled: â€œFling them into the canal, and all traces
NA
the night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to
get up and go away, to make haste, and get rid of it all. But to get
rid of it, turned out to be a very difficult task. He wandered along
the bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and looked
several times at the steps running down to the water, but he could not
think of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the stepsâ€™ edge,
and women were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored there, and
people were swarming everywhere. Moreover he could be seen and noticed
from the banks on all sides; it would look suspicious for a man to go
down on purpose, stop, and throw something into the water. And what if
the boxes were to float instead of sinking? And of course they would.
Even as it was, everyone he met seemed to stare and look round, as if
they had nothing to do but to watch him. â€œWhy is it, or can it be my
NA
At last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the
Neva. There were not so many people there, he would be less observed,
and it would be more convenient in every way, above all it was further
off. He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half-hour,
worried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it
before. And that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan, simply
because he had thought of it in delirium! He had become extremely absent
and forgetful and he was aware of it. He certainly must make haste.
He walked towards the Neva along V---- Prospect, but on the way
another idea struck him. â€œWhy to the Neva? Would it not be better to go
somewhere far off, to the Islands again, and there hide the things
in some solitary place, in a wood or under a bush, and mark the spot
NA
seemed to him a sound one. But he was not destined to go there. For
coming out of V---- Prospect towards the square, he saw on the left a
passage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard. On the right
hand, the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched far
into the court; on the left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for
twenty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left. Here
was a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sorts was
lying. At the end of the court, the corner of a low, smutty, stone shed,
apparently part of some workshop, peeped from behind the hoarding. It
was probably a carriage builderâ€™s or carpenterâ€™s shed; the whole place
from the entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the place to
throw it, he thought. Not seeing anyone in the yard, he slipped in, and
at once saw near the gate a sink, such as is often put in yards where
there are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had
been scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism, â€œStanding here
NA
suspicious about his going in. â€œHere I could throw it all in a heap and
NA
Looking round once more, with his hand already in his pocket, he noticed
against the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big unhewn
stone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a
street. He could hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but he
could not be seen from the entrance, unless someone came in from the
street, which might well happen indeed, so there was need of haste.
He bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in both hands,
and using all his strength turned it over. Under the stone was a small
hollow in the ground, and he immediately emptied his pocket into it.
The purse lay at the top, and yet the hollow was not filled up. Then he
seized the stone again and with one twist turned it back, so that it was
in the same position again, though it stood a very little higher. But
he scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot.
Nothing could be noticed.
Then he went out, and turned into the square. Again an intense,
almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant, as it had in
the police-office. â€œI have buried my tracks! And who, who can think of
looking under that stone? It has been lying there most likely ever since
the house was built, and will lie as many years more. And if it were

Yes, he remembered that he began laughing a thin, nervous noiseless
laugh, and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square. But
when he reached the K---- Boulevard where two days before he had come
upon that girl, his laughter suddenly ceased. Other ideas crept into his
mind. He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat
on which after the girl was gone, he had sat and pondered, and that it
would be hateful, too, to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had

He walked, looking about him angrily and distractedly. All his ideas now
seemed to be circling round some single point, and he felt that there
really was such a point, and that now, now, he was left facing that
point--and for the first time, indeed, during the last two months.
NA
â€œIf it has begun, then it has begun. Hang the new life! Good Lord, how
stupid it is!... And what lies I told to-day! How despicably I fawned
upon that wretched Ilya Petrovitch! But that is all folly! What do I
care for them all, and my fawning upon them! It is not that at all! It

Suddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple
question perplexed and bitterly confounded him.
â€œIf it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically, if
I really had a certain and definite object, how is it I did not even
glance into the purse and donâ€™t know what I had there, for which I have
undergone these agonies, and have deliberately undertaken this base,
filthy degrading business? And here I wanted at once to throw into the
water the purse together with all the things which I had not seen
NA
Yes, that was so, that was all so. Yet he had known it all before, and
it was not a new question for him, even when it was decided in the night
without hesitation and consideration, as though so it must be, as though
it could not possibly be otherwise.... Yes, he had known it all, and
understood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the
moment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out
of it.... Yes, so it was.

worrying and fretting myself, and I donâ€™t know what I am doing....
Yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been
worrying myself.... I shall get well and I shall not worry.... But what

He walked on without resting. He had a terrible longing for some
distraction, but he did not know what to do, what to attempt. A new
overwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him
every moment; this was an immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for
everything surrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred.
All who met him were loathsome to him--he loathed their faces, their
movements, their gestures. If anyone had addressed him, he felt that he
might have spat at him or bitten him....
He stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the Little Neva, near

 he thought, â€œwhy, I have not come to Razumihin of my own accord! Here
itâ€™s the same thing over again.... Very interesting to know, though;
have I come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance? Never
mind, I said the day before yesterday that I would go and see him the
day _after_; well, and so I will! Besides I really cannot go further
NA
He went up to Razumihinâ€™s room on the fifth floor.
The latter was at home in his garret, busily writing at the moment, and
he opened the door himself. It was four months since they had seen each
other. Razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing-gown, with slippers on
his bare feet, unkempt, unshaven and unwashed. His face showed surprise.
NA
brief pause, he whistled. â€œAs hard up as all that! Why, brother, youâ€™ve

And when he had sunk down on the American leather sofa, which was
in even worse condition than his own, Razumihin saw at once that his
visitor was ill.

him carefully.
NA
Raskolnikov got up from the sofa. As he had mounted the stairs to
Razumihinâ€™s, he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend
face to face. Now, in a flash, he knew, that what he was least of all
disposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the
wide world. His spleen rose within him. He almost choked with rage at
himself as soon as he crossed Razumihinâ€™s threshold.
NA
NA
NA
â€œThen why the devil have you come? Are you mad, or what? Why, this
NA
â€œWell, then, I came to you because I know no one but you who could
help... to begin... because you are kinder than anyone--cleverer, I
mean, and can judge... and now I see that I want nothing. Do you hear?
Nothing at all... no oneâ€™s services... no oneâ€™s sympathy. I am by
NA
â€œStay a minute, you sweep! You are a perfect madman. As you like for all
I care. I have no lessons, do you see, and I donâ€™t care about that, but
thereâ€™s a bookseller, Heruvimov--and he takes the place of a lesson.
I would not exchange him for five lessons. Heâ€™s doing publishing of a
kind, and issuing natural science manuals and what a circulation they
have! The very titles are worth the money! You always maintained that I
was a fool, but by Jove, my boy, there are greater fools than I am!
Now he is setting up for being advanced, not that he has an inkling of
anything, but, of course, I encourage him. Here are two signatures of
the German text--in my opinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discusses
the question, â€˜Is woman a human being?â€™ And, of course, triumphantly
proves that she is. Heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a
contribution to the woman question; I am translating it; he will expand
these two and a half signatures into six, we shall make up a gorgeous
title half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble. It will do! He
pays me six roubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roubles
for the job, and Iâ€™ve had six already in advance. When we have finished
this, we are going to begin a translation about whales, and then some of
the dullest scandals out of the second part of _Les Confessions_ we have
marked for translation; somebody has told Heruvimov, that Rousseau was
a kind of Radishchev. You may be sure I donâ€™t contradict him, hang him!
Well, would you like to do the second signature of â€˜_Is woman a human
being?_â€™ If you would, take the German and pens and paper--all those
are provided, and take three roubles; for as I have had six roubles in
advance on the whole thing, three roubles come to you for your share.
And when you have finished the signature there will be another three
roubles for you. And please donâ€™t think I am doing you a service; quite
the contrary, as soon as you came in, I saw how you could help me; to
begin with, I am weak in spelling, and secondly, I am sometimes utterly
adrift in German, so that I make it up as I go along for the most part.
The only comfort is, that itâ€™s bound to be a change for the better.
Though who can tell, maybe itâ€™s sometimes for the worse. Will you take
NA
Raskolnikov took the German sheets in silence, took the three roubles
and without a word went out. Razumihin gazed after him in astonishment.
But when Raskolnikov was in the next street, he turned back, mounted the
stairs to Razumihinâ€™s again and laying on the table the German article
and the three roubles, went out again, still without uttering a word.
NA
â€œWhat farce is this? Youâ€™ll drive me crazy too... what did you come to
NA
NA
NA
Raskolnikov continued descending the staircase in silence.
NA
No answer.
NA
But Raskolnikov was already stepping into the street. On the Nikolaevsky
Bridge he was roused to full consciousness again by an unpleasant
incident. A coachman, after shouting at him two or three times, gave him
a violent lash on the back with his whip, for having almost fallen under
his horsesâ€™ hoofs. The lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to the
railing (for some unknown reason he had been walking in the very middle
of the bridge in the traffic). He angrily clenched and ground his teeth.
He heard laughter, of course.
NA
NA
â€œPretending to be drunk, for sure, and getting under the wheels on
NA
NA
But while he stood at the railing, still looking angry and bewildered
after the retreating carriage, and rubbing his back, he suddenly felt
someone thrust money into his hand. He looked. It was an elderly woman
in a kerchief and goatskin shoes, with a girl, probably her daughter,
wearing a hat, and carrying a green parasol.
NA
He took it and they passed on. It was a piece of twenty copecks. From
his dress and appearance they might well have taken him for a beggar
asking alms in the streets, and the gift of the twenty copecks he
doubtless owed to the blow, which made them feel sorry for him.
He closed his hand on the twenty copecks, walked on for ten paces, and
turned facing the Neva, looking towards the palace. The sky was without
a cloud and the water was almost bright blue, which is so rare in the
Neva. The cupola of the cathedral, which is seen at its best from the
bridge about twenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight,
and in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished.
The pain from the lash went off, and Raskolnikov forgot about it; one
uneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely. He stood
still, and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot was
especially familiar to him. When he was attending the university, he had
hundreds of times--generally on his way home--stood still on this spot,
gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at
a vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him. It left him strangely
cold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless. He wondered
every time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrusting
himself, put off finding the explanation of it. He vividly recalled
those old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him that it was
no mere chance that he recalled them now. It struck him as strange and
grotesque, that he should have stopped at the same spot as before,
as though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts, be
interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him...
so short a time ago. He felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung his
heart. Deep down, hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him
now--all his old past, his old thoughts, his old problems and theories,
his old impressions and that picture and himself and all, all.... He
felt as though he were flying upwards, and everything were vanishing
from his sight. Making an unconscious movement with his hand, he
suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist. He opened his
hand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep of his arm flung it into
the water; then he turned and went home. It seemed to him, he had cut
himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment.
Evening was coming on when he reached home, so that he must have been
walking about six hours. How and where he came back he did not remember.
Undressing, and quivering like an overdriven horse, he lay down on the
sofa, drew his greatcoat over him, and at once sank into oblivion....
It was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream. Good God, what a
scream! Such unnatural sounds, such howling, wailing, grinding, tears,
blows and curses he had never heard.
He could never have imagined such brutality, such frenzy. In terror he
sat up in bed, almost swooning with agony. But the fighting, wailing
and cursing grew louder and louder. And then to his intense amazement
he caught the voice of his landlady. She was howling, shrieking and
wailing, rapidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not make
out what she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, not to be
beaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs. The voice of
her assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost
a croak; but he, too, was saying something, and just as quickly
and indistinctly, hurrying and spluttering. All at once Raskolnikov
trembled; he recognised the voice--it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch.
Ilya Petrovitch here and beating the landlady! He is kicking her,
banging her head against the steps--thatâ€™s clear, that can be told
from the sounds, from the cries and the thuds. How is it, is the world
topsy-turvy? He could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys
and all the staircases; he heard voices, exclamations, knocking, doors
NA
seriously that he had gone mad. But no, he heard too distinctly! And
they would come to him then next, â€œfor no doubt... itâ€™s all about
NA
with the latch, but he could not lift his hand... besides, it would
be useless. Terror gripped his heart like ice, tortured him and numbed
him.... But at last all this uproar, after continuing about ten minutes,
began gradually to subside. The landlady was moaning and groaning; Ilya
Petrovitch was still uttering threats and curses.... But at last he,
too, seemed to be silent, and now he could not be heard. â€œCan he have
NA
weeping and moaning... and then her door slammed.... Now the crowd was
going from the stairs to their rooms, exclaiming, disputing, calling
to one another, raising their voices to a shout, dropping them to a
whisper. There must have been numbers of them--almost all the inmates
of the block. â€œBut, good God, how could it be! And why, why had he come
NA
Raskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa, but could not close his eyes. He
lay for half an hour in such anguish, such an intolerable sensation of
infinite terror as he had never experienced before. Suddenly a bright
light flashed into his room. Nastasya came in with a candle and a plate
of soup. Looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not
asleep, she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she
had brought--bread, salt, a plate, a spoon.
â€œYouâ€™ve eaten nothing since yesterday, I warrant. Youâ€™ve been trudging

NA
She looked intently at him.
NA
â€œJust now... half an hour ago, Ilya Petrovitch, the assistant
superintendent, on the stairs.... Why was he ill-treating her like that,

Nastasya scrutinised him, silent and frowning, and her scrutiny lasted a
long time. He felt uneasy, even frightened at her searching eyes.

â€œNo one has been here. Thatâ€™s the blood crying in your ears. When

He made no answer. Nastasya still stood over him, watching him.
NA
She went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water.
He remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling
some on his neck. Then followed forgetfulness.
CHAPTER III
He was not completely unconscious, however, all the time he was ill; he
was in a feverish state, sometimes delirious, sometimes half conscious.
He remembered a great deal afterwards. Sometimes it seemed as though
there were a number of people round him; they wanted to take him away
somewhere, there was a great deal of squabbling and discussing about
him. Then he would be alone in the room; they had all gone away afraid
of him, and only now and then opened the door a crack to look at him;
they threatened him, plotted something together, laughed, and mocked
at him. He remembered Nastasya often at his bedside; he distinguished
another person, too, whom he seemed to know very well, though he could
not remember who he was, and this fretted him, even made him cry.
Sometimes he fancied he had been lying there a month; at other times
it all seemed part of the same day. But of _that_--of _that_ he had
no recollection, and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten
something he ought to remember. He worried and tormented himself trying
to remember, moaned, flew into a rage, or sank into awful, intolerable
terror. Then he struggled to get up, would have run away, but someone
always prevented him by force, and he sank back into impotence and
forgetfulness. At last he returned to complete consciousness.
It happened at ten oâ€™clock in the morning. On fine days the sun shone
into the room at that hour, throwing a streak of light on the right
wall and the corner near the door. Nastasya was standing beside him
with another person, a complete stranger, who was looking at him
very inquisitively. He was a young man with a beard, wearing a full,
short-waisted coat, and looked like a messenger. The landlady was
peeping in at the half-opened door. Raskolnikov sat up.
NA
NA
NA
Concluding that he had returned to his senses, the landlady closed the
door and disappeared. She was always shy and dreaded conversations or
discussions. She was a woman of forty, not at all bad-looking, fat
and buxom, with black eyes and eyebrows, good-natured from fatness and
laziness, and absurdly bashful.
NA
the door was flung open, and, stooping a little, as he was so tall,
Razumihin came in.
NA
this a lodging! So you are conscious, brother? Iâ€™ve just heard the news
NA
NA
NA
NA
Vrazumihin, at your service; not Razumihin, as I am always called, but
Vrazumihin, a student and gentleman; and he is my friend. And who are
NA
â€œI am the messenger from our office, from the merchant Shelopaev, and
NA
NA
NA
Raskolnikov. â€œFor the last four days you have scarcely eaten or drunk
anything. We had to give you tea in spoonfuls. I brought Zossimov to see
you twice. You remember Zossimov? He examined you carefully and said at
once it was nothing serious--something seemed to have gone to your head.
Some nervous nonsense, the result of bad feeding, he says you have not
had enough beer and radish, but itâ€™s nothing much, it will pass and you
will be all right. Zossimov is a first-rate fellow! He is making quite a

you explain what you want? You must know, Rodya, this is the second time
they have sent from the office; but it was another man last time, and I
NA
â€œThat was the day before yesterday, I venture to say, if you please,

NA
NA
NA
â€œAt your mammaâ€™s request, through Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin, of whom
I presume you have heard more than once, a remittance is sent to you
NA
an intelligible condition, Iâ€™ve thirty-five roubles to remit to you, as
Semyon Semyonovitch has received from Afanasy Ivanovitch at your mammaâ€™s
request instructions to that effect, as on previous occasions. Do you

NA
â€œThatâ€™s the gentleman, Vahrushin, Afanasy Ivanovitch. And at the request
of your mamma, who has sent you a remittance once before in the
same manner through him, he did not refuse this time also, and sent
instructions to Semyon Semyonovitch some days since to hand you
NA
â€œThat â€˜hoping for better to comeâ€™ is the best thing youâ€™ve said, though
â€˜your mammaâ€™ is not bad either. Come then, what do you say? Is he fully
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œGive it to me. Here, Rodya, sit up. Iâ€™ll hold you. Take the pen and
scribble â€˜Raskolnikovâ€™ for him. For just now, brother, money is sweeter
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œDonâ€™t want the money! Come, brother, thatâ€™s nonsense, I bear witness.
Donâ€™t trouble, please, itâ€™s only that he is on his travels again. But
thatâ€™s pretty common with him at all times though.... You are a man of
judgment and we will take him in hand, that is, more simply, take his

NA
â€œNo, no. Why should we trouble you? You are a man of judgment.... Now,

NA

The messenger took out the money and went away.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Raskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonishment and a dull,
unreasoning terror. He made up his mind to keep quiet and see what
NA
thought.
In a couple of minutes Nastasya returned with the soup, and announced
that the tea would be ready directly. With the soup she brought two
spoons, two plates, salt, pepper, mustard for the beef, and so on. The
table was set as it had not been for a long time. The cloth was clean.
â€œIt would not be amiss, Nastasya, if Praskovya Pavlovna were to send us
NA
NA
carry out his orders.
Raskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention. Meanwhile
Razumihin sat down on the sofa beside him, as clumsily as a bear put his
left arm round Raskolnikovâ€™s head, although he was able to sit up, and
with his right hand gave him a spoonful of soup, blowing on it that
it might not burn him. But the soup was only just warm. Raskolnikov
swallowed one spoonful greedily, then a second, then a third. But after
giving him a few more spoonfuls of soup, Razumihin suddenly stopped, and
said that he must ask Zossimov whether he ought to have more.
Nastasya came in with two bottles of beer.
NA
NA
â€œCut along, Nastasya, and bring some tea, for tea we may venture on
NA
pulled the soup and meat in front of him, and began eating as though he
had not touched food for three days.
NA
mumbled with his mouth full of beef, â€œand itâ€™s all Pashenka, your dear
little landlady, who sees to that; she loves to do anything for me. I
donâ€™t ask for it, but, of course, I donâ€™t object. And hereâ€™s Nastasya
with the tea. She is a quick girl. Nastasya, my dear, wonâ€™t you have
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
He poured out two cups, left his dinner, and sat on the sofa again. As
before, he put his left arm round the sick manâ€™s head, raised him up
and gave him tea in spoonfuls, again blowing each spoonful steadily and
earnestly, as though this process was the principal and most effective
means towards his friendâ€™s recovery. Raskolnikov said nothing and made
no resistance, though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa
without support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon, but
even perhaps could have walked about. But from some queer, almost
animal, cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and lying
low for a time, pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possession
of his faculties, and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on.
Yet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance. After sipping a dozen
spoonfuls of tea, he suddenly released his head, pushed the spoon away
capriciously, and sank back on the pillow. There were actually real
pillows under his head now, down pillows in clean cases, he observed
that, too, and took note of it.
â€œPashenka must give us some raspberry jam to-day to make him some
NA
his soup and beer again.
NA
a saucer on her five outspread fingers and sipping tea through a lump of
sugar.
â€œSheâ€™ll get it at the shop, my dear. You see, Rodya, all sorts of things
have been happening while you have been laid up. When you decamped in
that rascally way without leaving your address, I felt so angry that I
resolved to find you out and punish you. I set to work that very day.
How I ran about making inquiries for you! This lodging of yours I had
forgotten, though I never remembered it, indeed, because I did not know
it; and as for your old lodgings, I could only remember it was at the
Five Corners, Harlamovâ€™s house. I kept trying to find that Harlamovâ€™s
house, and afterwards it turned out that it was not Harlamovâ€™s, but
Buchâ€™s. How one muddles up sound sometimes! So I lost my temper, and I
went on the chance to the address bureau next day, and only fancy, in
NA
NA
â€œI should think so; and yet a General Kobelev they could not find while
I was there. Well, itâ€™s a long story. But as soon as I did land on this
place, I soon got to know all your affairs--all, all, brother, I know
everything; Nastasya here will tell you. I made the acquaintance of
Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, and the house-porter and Mr.
Zametov, Alexandr Grigorievitch, the head clerk in the police office,

NA
NA
NA
NA
mirth.
â€œIâ€™ll make a note of it. Well, brother, to make a long story short,
I was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant
influences in the locality, but Pashenka won the day. I had not
expected, brother, to find her so... prepossessing. Eh, what do you
NA
Raskolnikov did not speak, but he still kept his eyes fixed upon him,
full of alarm.
NA
on, not at all embarrassed by his silence.
NA
her unspeakable delight.
â€œItâ€™s a pity, brother, that you did not set to work in the right way
at first. You ought to have approached her differently. She is, so
to speak, a most unaccountable character. But we will talk about her
character later.... How could you let things come to such a pass that
she gave up sending you your dinner? And that I O U? You must have been
mad to sign an I O U. And that promise of marriage when her daughter,
Natalya Yegorovna, was alive?... I know all about it! But I see thatâ€™s
a delicate matter and I am an ass; forgive me. But, talking of
foolishness, do you know Praskovya Pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as
NA
NA
to keep up the conversation.
NA
of him. â€œBut she is not very clever either, eh? She is essentially,
essentially an unaccountable character! I am sometimes quite at a loss,
I assure you.... She must be forty; she says she is thirty-six, and
of course she has every right to say so. But I swear I judge her
intellectually, simply from the metaphysical point of view; there is a
sort of symbolism sprung up between us, a sort of algebra or what not!
I donâ€™t understand it! Well, thatâ€™s all nonsense. Only, seeing that you
are not a student now and have lost your lessons and your clothes, and
that through the young ladyâ€™s death she has no need to treat you as
a relation, she suddenly took fright; and as you hid in your den and
dropped all your old relations with her, she planned to get rid of you.
And sheâ€™s been cherishing that design a long time, but was sorry to lose
NA
â€œIt was base of me to say that.... My mother herself is almost
NA
 Raskolnikov said loudly and distinctly.
â€œYes, you did very sensibly. But the worst of it is that at that point
Mr. Tchebarov turns up, a business man. Pashenka would never have
thought of doing anything on her own account, she is too retiring; but
the business man is by no means retiring, and first thing he puts the
question, â€˜Is there any hope of realising the I O U?â€™ Answer: there is,
because he has a mother who would save her Rodya with her hundred and
twenty-five roubles pension, if she has to starve herself; and a sister,
too, who would go into bondage for his sake. Thatâ€™s what he was building
upon.... Why do you start? I know all the ins and outs of your affairs
now, my dear boy--itâ€™s not for nothing that you were so open with
Pashenka when you were her prospective son-in-law, and I say all this as
a friend.... But I tell you what it is; an honest and sensitive man is
open; and a business man â€˜listens and goes on eatingâ€™ you up. Well,
then she gave the I O U by way of payment to this Tchebarov, and without
hesitation he made a formal demand for payment. When I heard of all this
I wanted to blow him up, too, to clear my conscience, but by that time
harmony reigned between me and Pashenka, and I insisted on stopping
the whole affair, engaging that you would pay. I went security for you,
brother. Do you understand? We called Tchebarov, flung him ten
roubles and got the I O U back from him, and here I have the honour of
presenting it to you. She trusts your word now. Here, take it, you see I

Razumihin put the note on the table. Raskolnikov looked at him and
turned to the wall without uttering a word. Even Razumihin felt a
twinge.

NA
asked, after a momentâ€™s pause without turning his head.
â€œYes, and you flew into a rage about it, especially when I brought
NA
NA
and fixed his eyes on Razumihin.
â€œWhatâ€™s the matter with you?... What are you upset about? He wanted to
make your acquaintance because I talked to him a lot about you.... How
could I have found out so much except from him? He is a capital
fellow, brother, first-rate... in his own way, of course. Now we are
friends--see each other almost every day. I have moved into this part,
you know. I have only just moved. Iâ€™ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna
once or twice.... Do you remember Luise, Luise Ivanovna?
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhat next? What did you rave about? What people do rave about.... Well,
NA
and took up his cap.
NA
â€œHow he keeps on! Are you afraid of having let out some secret? Donâ€™t
worry yourself; you said nothing about a countess. But you said a lot
about a bulldog, and about ear-rings and chains, and about Krestovsky
Island, and some porter, and Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, the
assistant superintendent. And another thing that was of special interest
to you was your own sock. You whined, â€˜Give me my sock.â€™ Zametov
hunted all about your room for your socks, and with his own scented,
ring-bedecked fingers he gave you the rag. And only then were you
comforted, and for the next twenty-four hours you held the wretched
thing in your hand; we could not get it from you. It is most likely
somewhere under your quilt at this moment. And then you asked so
piteously for fringe for your trousers. We tried to find out what sort
of fringe, but we could not make it out. Now to business! Here are
thirty-five roubles; I take ten of them, and shall give you an account
of them in an hour or two. I will let Zossimov know at the same time,
though he ought to have been here long ago, for it is nearly twelve. And
you, Nastasya, look in pretty often while I am away, to see whether he
wants a drink or anything else. And I will tell Pashenka what is wanted
NA
NA
out; then she opened the door and stood listening, but could not resist
running downstairs after him. She was very eager to hear what he would
say to the landlady. She was evidently quite fascinated by Razumihin.
No sooner had she left the room than the sick man flung off the
bedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman. With burning, twitching
impatience he had waited for them to be gone so that he might set to
work. But to what work? Now, as though to spite him, it eluded him.
â€œGood God, only tell me one thing: do they know of it yet or not? What
if they know it and are only pretending, mocking me while I am laid up,
and then they will come in and tell me that itâ€™s been discovered long
ago and that they have only... What am I to do now? Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve
forgotten, as though on purpose; forgotten it all at once, I remembered
NA
He stood in the middle of the room and gazed in miserable bewilderment
about him; he walked to the door, opened it, listened; but that was not
what he wanted. Suddenly, as though recalling something, he rushed to
the corner where there was a hole under the paper, began examining it,
put his hand into the hole, fumbled--but that was not it. He went to the
stove, opened it and began rummaging in the ashes; the frayed edges of
his trousers and the rags cut off his pocket were lying there just as
he had thrown them. No one had looked, then! Then he remembered the sock
about which Razumihin had just been telling him. Yes, there it lay on
the sofa under the quilt, but it was so covered with dust and grime that
Zametov could not have seen anything on it.
â€œBah, Zametov! The police office! And why am I sent for to the police
office? Whereâ€™s the notice? Bah! I am mixing it up; that was then. I
looked at my sock then, too, but now... now I have been ill. But

helplessly sitting on the sofa again. â€œWhat does it mean? Am I still in
delirium, or is it real? I believe it is real.... Ah, I remember; I must
escape! Make haste to escape. Yes, I must, I must escape! Yes... but
where? And where are my clothes? Iâ€™ve no boots. Theyâ€™ve taken them away!
Theyâ€™ve hidden them! I understand! Ah, here is my coat--they passed that
over! And here is money on the table, thank God! And hereâ€™s the I O U...
Iâ€™ll take the money and go and take another lodging. They wonâ€™t find
me!... Yes, but the address bureau? Theyâ€™ll find me, Razumihin will find
me. Better escape altogether... far away... to America, and let them
do their worst! And take the I O U... it would be of use there.... What
else shall I take? They think I am ill! They donâ€™t know that I can walk,
ha-ha-ha! I could see by their eyes that they know all about it! If
only I could get downstairs! And what if they have set a watch
there--policemen! Whatâ€™s this tea? Ah, and here is beer left, half a
NA
He snatched up the bottle, which still contained a glassful of beer, and
gulped it down with relish, as though quenching a flame in his breast.
But in another minute the beer had gone to his head, and a faint and
even pleasant shiver ran down his spine. He lay down and pulled the
quilt over him. His sick and incoherent thoughts grew more and more
disconnected, and soon a light, pleasant drowsiness came upon him. With
a sense of comfort he nestled his head into the pillow, wrapped more
closely about him the soft, wadded quilt which had replaced the old,
ragged greatcoat, sighed softly and sank into a deep, sound, refreshing
sleep.
He woke up, hearing someone come in. He opened his eyes and saw
Razumihin standing in the doorway, uncertain whether to come in or
not. Raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and gazed at him, as though
trying to recall something.
NA
 Razumihin shouted down the stairs. â€œYou shall have the account
NA
NA
â€œYes, you had a fine sleep, brother, itâ€™s almost evening, it will be six
NA
NA
â€œAnd why not? It will do you good. Whatâ€™s the hurry? A tryst, is it?
Weâ€™ve all time before us. Iâ€™ve been waiting for the last three hours for
you; Iâ€™ve been up twice and found you asleep. Iâ€™ve called on Zossimov
twice; not at home, only fancy! But no matter, he will turn up. And
Iâ€™ve been out on my own business, too. You know Iâ€™ve been moving to-day,
moving with my uncle. I have an uncle living with me now. But thatâ€™s
no matter, to business. Give me the parcel, Nastasya. We will open it
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Raskolnikov pondered. The morning seemed like a dream to him. He could
not remember alone, and looked inquiringly at Razumihin.
NA
not quite yourself. Now you are better for your sleep.... You really
look much better. First-rate! Well, to business. Look here, my dear
NA
He began untying the bundle, which evidently interested him.
â€œBelieve me, brother, this is something specially near my heart. For we
must make a man of you. Letâ€™s begin from the top. Do you see this
NA
NA
NA
â€œCome, Rodya, my boy, donâ€™t oppose it, afterwards will be too late; and
I shanâ€™t sleep all night, for I bought it by guess, without measure.
NA
proper head-covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in
its own way. Tolstyakov, a friend of mine, is always obliged to take off
his pudding basin when he goes into any public place where other
people wear their hats or caps. People think he does it from slavish
politeness, but itâ€™s simply because he is ashamed of his birdâ€™s nest;
he is such a boastful fellow! Look, Nastasya, here are two specimens of
NA
battered hat, which for some unknown reason, he called a Palmerston--â€œor
this jewel! Guess the price, Rodya, what do you suppose I paid for it,
NA
speak.
NA
NA
cost more than that--eighty copecks! And that only because it has been
worn. And itâ€™s bought on condition that whenâ€™s itâ€™s worn out, they will
give you another next year. Yes, on my word! Well, now let us pass to
the United States of America, as they called them at school. I assure
NA
pair of light, summer trousers of grey woollen material. â€œNo holes, no
spots, and quite respectable, although a little worn; and a waistcoat
to match, quite in the fashion. And its being worn really is an
improvement, itâ€™s softer, smoother.... You see, Rodya, to my thinking,
the great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to the
seasons; if you donâ€™t insist on having asparagus in January, you keep
your money in your purse; and itâ€™s the same with this purchase. Itâ€™s
summer now, so Iâ€™ve been buying summer things--warmer materials will be
wanted for autumn, so you will have to throw these away in any case...
especially as they will be done for by then from their own lack of
coherence if not your higher standard of luxury. Come, price them! What
do you say? Two roubles twenty-five copecks! And remember the condition:
if you wear these out, you will have another suit for nothing! They only
do business on that system at Fedyaevâ€™s; if youâ€™ve bought a thing once,
you are satisfied for life, for you will never go there again of your
own free will. Now for the boots. What do you say? You see that they are
a bit worn, but theyâ€™ll last a couple of months, for itâ€™s foreign work
and foreign leather; the secretary of the English Embassy sold them last
week--he had only worn them six days, but he was very short of cash.
NA
NA
NA
old, broken boot, stiffly coated with dry mud. â€œI did not go
empty-handed--they took the size from this monster. We all did our best.
And as to your linen, your landlady has seen to that. Here, to begin
with are three shirts, hempen but with a fashionable front.... Well
now then, eighty copecks the cap, two roubles twenty-five copecks the
suit--together three roubles five copecks--a rouble and a half for the
boots--for, you see, they are very good--and that makes four roubles
fifty-five copecks; five roubles for the underclothes--they were
bought in the lo--which makes exactly nine roubles fifty-five copecks.
Forty-five copecks change in coppers. Will you take it? And so, Rodya,
you are set up with a complete new rig-out, for your overcoat will
serve, and even has a style of its own. That comes from getting oneâ€™s
clothes from Sharmerâ€™s! As for your socks and other things, I leave them
to you; weâ€™ve twenty-five roubles left. And as for Pashenka and paying
for your lodging, donâ€™t you worry. I tell you sheâ€™ll trust you for
anything. And now, brother, let me change your linen, for I daresay you

NA
with disgust to Razumihinâ€™s efforts to be playful about his purchases.
NA
 Razumihin insisted. â€œNastasya, donâ€™t be bashful, but help me--thatâ€™s
NA
latter sank back on the pillows and for a minute or two said nothing.
NA
NA
â€œMoney? Why, your own, what the messenger brought from Vahrushin, your
NA
NA
Razumihin looked at him, frowning and uneasy.
The door opened and a tall, stout man whose appearance seemed familiar
to Raskolnikov came in.
CHAPTER IV
Zossimov was a tall, fat man with a puffy, colourless, clean-shaven face
and straight flaxen hair. He wore spectacles, and a big gold ring on
his fat finger. He was twenty-seven. He had on a light grey fashionable
loose coat, light summer trousers, and everything about him loose,
fashionable and spick and span; his linen was irreproachable, his
watch-chain was massive. In manner he was slow and, as it were,
nonchalant, and at the same time studiously free and easy; he made
efforts to conceal his self-importance, but it was apparent at every
instant. All his acquaintances found him tedious, but said he was clever
at his work.
NA
 cried Razumihin.
NA
Raskolnikov, watching him carefully and, sitting down at the foot of the
sofa, he settled himself as comfortably as he could.
NA
NA
â€œThatâ€™s very natural; you might have put it off if he did not wish
NA
NA
and irritably. He raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with
glittering eyes, but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to
the wall. Zossimov watched him intently.
NA
NA
They told him, and asked what he might have.
â€œHe may have anything... soup, tea... mushrooms and cucumbers, of
course, you must not give him; heâ€™d better not have meat either, and...
NA
other. â€œNo more medicine or anything. Iâ€™ll look at him again to-morrow.
NA
NA
NA
â€œI would not disturb him to-morrow at all, but I donâ€™t know... a little,
NA
â€œAch, what a nuisance! Iâ€™ve got a house-warming party to-night; itâ€™s
only a step from here. Couldnâ€™t he come? He could lie on the sofa. You
NA
NA
â€œOh, nothing--tea, vodka, herrings. There will be a pie... just our
NA
NA
â€œAll neighbours here, almost all new friends, except my old uncle, and
he is new too--he only arrived in Petersburg yesterday to see to some

NA
â€œHeâ€™s been stagnating all his life as a district postmaster; gets a
little pension. He is sixty-five--not worth talking about.... But I
am fond of him. Porfiry Petrovitch, the head of the Investigation
NA
NA
â€œA very distant one. But why are you scowling? Because you quarrelled
NA
NA
â€œSo much the better. Well, there will be some students, a teacher, a

NA
NA
â€œOh, you particular gentleman! Principles! You are worked by principles,
as it were by springs; you wonâ€™t venture to turn round on your own
account. If a man is a nice fellow, thatâ€™s the only principle I go upon.
NA
NA
NA
 Razumihin cried with unnatural irritability. â€œI donâ€™t praise him for
taking bribes. I only say he is a nice man in his own way! But if one
looks at men in all ways--are there many good ones left? Why, I am sure
I shouldnâ€™t be worth a baked onion myself... perhaps with you thrown
NA
NA
â€œAnd I wouldnâ€™t give more than one for you. No more of your jokes!
Zametov is no more than a boy. I can pull his hair and one must draw him
not repel him. Youâ€™ll never improve a man by repelling him, especially
a boy. One has to be twice as careful with a boy. Oh, you progressive
dullards! You donâ€™t understand. You harm yourselves running another man
NA
NA
â€œWhy, itâ€™s all about a house-painter.... We are getting him out of
a mess! Though indeed thereâ€™s nothing to fear now. The matter is
NA
NA
â€œWhy, havenâ€™t I told you about it? I only told you the beginning then
about the murder of the old pawnbroker-woman. Well, the painter is mixed
NA
â€œOh, I heard about that murder before and was rather interested in it...

NA
Raskolnikov. She remained in the room all the time, standing by the door
listening.
NA
â€œLizaveta, who sold old clothes. Didnâ€™t you know her? She used to come
NA
Raskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty, yellow paper he
picked out one clumsy, white flower with brown lines on it and began
examining how many petals there were in it, how many scallops in the
petals and how many lines on them. He felt his arms and legs as lifeless
as though they had been cut off. He did not attempt to move, but stared
obstinately at the flower.
NA
with marked displeasure. She sighed and was silent.
NA
NA
â€œEvidence, indeed! Evidence that was no evidence, and thatâ€™s what we
have to prove. It was just as they pitched on those fellows, Koch and
Pestryakov, at first. Foo! how stupidly itâ€™s all done, it makes one
sick, though itâ€™s not oneâ€™s business! Pestryakov may be coming
to-night.... By the way, Rodya, youâ€™ve heard about the business already;
it happened before you were ill, the day before you fainted at the
NA
Zossimov looked curiously at Raskolnikov. He did not stir.
NA
 Zossimov observed.
NA
bringing his fist down on the table. â€œWhatâ€™s the most offensive is not
their lying--one can always forgive lying--lying is a delightful thing,
for it leads to truth--what is offensive is that they lie and worship
their own lying.... I respect Porfiry, but... What threw them out at
first? The door was locked, and when they came back with the porter
it was open. So it followed that Koch and Pestryakov were the
NA
â€œBut donâ€™t excite yourself; they simply detained them, they could not
help that.... And, by the way, Iâ€™ve met that man Koch. He used to buy
NA
â€œYes, he is a swindler. He buys up bad debts, too. He makes a profession
of it. But enough of him! Do you know what makes me angry? Itâ€™s their
sickening rotten, petrified routine.... And this case might be the means
of introducing a new method. One can show from the psychological data
alone how to get on the track of the real man. â€˜We have facts,â€™ they
say. But facts are not everything--at least half the business lies in
NA
NA
â€œAnyway, one canâ€™t hold oneâ€™s tongue when one has a feeling, a tangible
feeling, that one might be a help if only.... Eh! Do you know the
NA
NA
â€œOh, yes! Well, hereâ€™s the story. Early on the third day after the
murder, when they were still dandling Koch and Pestryakov--though they
accounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff--an
unexpected fact turned up. A peasant called Dushkin, who keeps a
dram-shop facing the house, brought to the police office a jewellerâ€™s
case containing some gold ear-rings, and told a long rigamarole. â€˜The
day before yesterday, just after eight oâ€™clockâ€™--mark the day and the
hour!--â€˜a journeyman house-painter, Nikolay, who had been in to see me
already that day, brought me this box of gold ear-rings and stones, and
asked me to give him two roubles for them. When I asked him where he got
them, he said that he picked them up in the street. I did not ask him
anything more.â€™ I am telling you Dushkinâ€™s story. â€˜I gave him a noteâ€™--a
rouble that is--â€˜for I thought if he did not pawn it with me he would
with another. It would all come to the same thing--heâ€™d spend it on
drink, so the thing had better be with me. The further you hide it
the quicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if I hear any
rumours, Iâ€™ll take it to the police.â€™ Of course, thatâ€™s all taradiddle;
he lies like a horse, for I know this Dushkin, he is a pawnbroker and
a receiver of stolen goods, and he did not cheat Nikolay out of a
thirty-rouble trinket in order to give it to the police. He was simply
afraid. But no matter, to return to Dushkinâ€™s story. â€˜Iâ€™ve known
this peasant, Nikolay Dementyev, from a child; he comes from the same
province and district of ZaraÃ¯sk, we are both Ryazan men. And though
Nikolay is not a drunkard, he drinks, and I knew he had a job in that
house, painting work with Dmitri, who comes from the same village, too.
As soon as he got the rouble he changed it, had a couple of glasses,
took his change and went out. But I did not see Dmitri with him then.
And the next day I heard that someone had murdered Alyona Ivanovna and
her sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with an axe. I knew them, and I felt
suspicious about the ear-rings at once, for I knew the murdered woman
lent money on pledges. I went to the house, and began to make careful
inquiries without saying a word to anyone. First of all I asked, â€œIs
NA
had come home at daybreak drunk, stayed in the house about ten minutes,
and went out again. Dmitri didnâ€™t see him again and is finishing the
job alone. And their job is on the same staircase as the murder, on
the second floor. When I heard all that I did not say a word to
anyoneâ€™--thatâ€™s Dushkinâ€™s tale--â€˜but I found out what I could about
the murder, and went home feeling as suspicious as ever. And at eight
oâ€™clock this morningâ€™--that was the third day, you understand--â€˜I saw
Nikolay coming in, not sober, though not to say very drunk--he could
understand what was said to him. He sat down on the bench and did not
speak. There was only one stranger in the bar and a man I knew asleep
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
it was a bit queer; he did not look at me. â€œDid you hear what happened
NA
NA
his eyes were staring out of his head and he turned as white as chalk. I
told him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up. I wanted
NA
 And I signed to the boy to hold the door, and I came out from behind the
bar; but he darted out and down the street to the turning at a run.
I have not seen him since. Then my doubts were at an end--it was his
NA
NA
â€œWait! Hear the end. Of course they sought high and low for Nikolay;
they detained Dushkin and searched his house; Dmitri, too, was arrested;
the Kolomensky men also were turned inside out. And the day before
yesterday they arrested Nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town. He
had gone there, taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dram
for it. They gave it to him. A few minutes afterwards the woman went
to the cowshed, and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stable
adjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam, stood on a
block of wood, and was trying to put his neck in the noose. The woman
screeched her hardest; people ran in. â€˜So thatâ€™s what you are up to!â€™
â€˜Take me,â€™ he says, â€˜to such-and-such a police officer; Iâ€™ll confess
everything.â€™ Well, they took him to that police station--that is
here--with a suitable escort. So they asked him this and that, how old
he is, â€˜twenty-two,â€™ and so on. At the question, â€˜When you were working
with Dmitri, didnâ€™t you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a
time?â€™--answer: â€˜To be sure folks may have gone up and down, but I did
not notice them.â€™ â€˜And didnâ€™t you hear anything, any noise, and so on?â€™
â€˜We heard nothing special.â€™ â€˜And did you hear, Nikolay, that on the same
day Widow So-and-so and her sister were murdered and robbed?â€™ â€˜I
never knew a thing about it. The first I heard of it was from Afanasy
Pavlovitch the day before yesterday.â€™ â€˜And where did you find the
ear-rings?â€™ â€˜I found them on the pavement.â€™ â€˜Why didnâ€™t you go to work
with Dmitri the other day?â€™ â€˜Because I was drinking.â€™ â€˜And where were
you drinking?â€™ â€˜Oh, in such-and-such a place.â€™ â€˜Why did you run away
from Dushkinâ€™s?â€™ â€˜Because I was awfully frightened.â€™ â€˜What were
you frightened of?â€™ â€˜That I should be accused.â€™ â€˜How could you be
frightened, if you felt free from guilt?â€™ Now, Zossimov, you may not
believe me, that question was put literally in those words. I know it
NA
NA
â€œI am not talking of the evidence now, I am talking about that question,
of their own idea of themselves. Well, so they squeezed and squeezed
him and he confessed: â€˜I did not find it in the street, but in the flat
where I was painting with Dmitri.â€™ â€˜And how was that?â€™ â€˜Why, Dmitri and
I were painting there all day, and we were just getting ready to go, and
Dmitri took a brush and painted my face, and he ran off and I after him.
I ran after him, shouting my hardest, and at the bottom of the stairs I
ran right against the porter and some gentlemen--and how many gentlemen
were there I donâ€™t remember. And the porter swore at me, and the other
porter swore, too, and the porterâ€™s wife came out, and swore at us, too;
and a gentleman came into the entry with a lady, and he swore at us,
too, for Dmitri and I lay right across the way. I got hold of Dmitriâ€™s
hair and knocked him down and began beating him. And Dmitri, too, caught
me by the hair and began beating me. But we did it all not for temper
but in a friendly way, for sport. And then Dmitri escaped and ran into
the street, and I ran after him; but I did not catch him, and went back
to the flat alone; I had to clear up my things. I began putting them
together, expecting Dmitri to come, and there in the passage, in the
corner by the door, I stepped on the box. I saw it lying there wrapped
up in paper. I took off the paper, saw some little hooks, undid them,
NA
NA
cried suddenly, staring with a blank look of terror at Razumihin, and he
slowly sat up on the sofa, leaning on his hand.
NA
from his seat.
NA
silent for a while.
NA
inquiringly at Zossimov. The latter slightly shook his head.
NA
â€œWhat next? As soon as he saw the ear-rings, forgetting Dmitri and
everything, he took up his cap and ran to Dushkin and, as we know, got
a rouble from him. He told a lie saying he found them in the street, and
went off drinking. He keeps repeating his old story about the murder:
â€˜I know nothing of it, never heard of it till the day before yesterday.â€™
â€˜And why didnâ€™t you come to the police till now?â€™ â€˜I was frightened.â€™
â€˜And why did you try to hang yourself?â€™ â€˜From anxiety.â€™ â€˜What anxiety?â€™
â€˜That I should be accused of it.â€™ Well, thatâ€™s the whole story. And now
NA
â€œWhy, thereâ€™s no supposing. Thereâ€™s a clue, such as it is, a fact. You
NA
â€œNow theyâ€™ve simply taken him for the murderer. They havenâ€™t a shadow of
NA
â€œThatâ€™s nonsense. You are excited. But what about the ear-rings? You
must admit that, if on the very same day and hour ear-rings from the old
womanâ€™s box have come into Nikolayâ€™s hands, they must have come there
NA
NA
â€œHow can you, a doctor, whose duty it is to study man and who has more
opportunity than anyone else for studying human nature--how can you fail
to see the character of the man in the whole story? Donâ€™t you see at
once that the answers he has given in the examination are the holy
truth? They came into his hand precisely as he has told us--he stepped
NA
NA
â€œListen to me, listen attentively. The porter and Koch and Pestryakov
and the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman who
was sitting in the porterâ€™s lodge and the man Kryukov, who had just got
out of a cab at that minute and went in at the entry with a lady on his
arm, that is eight or ten witnesses, agree that Nikolay had Dmitri on
the ground, was lying on him beating him, while Dmitri hung on to his
hair, beating him, too. They lay right across the way, blocking the
thoroughfare. They were sworn at on all sides while they â€˜like childrenâ€™
(the very words of the witnesses) were falling over one another,
squealing, fighting and laughing with the funniest faces, and, chasing
one another like children, they ran into the street. Now take careful
note. The bodies upstairs were warm, you understand, warm when they
found them! If they, or Nikolay alone, had murdered them and broken open
the boxes, or simply taken part in the robbery, allow me to ask you one
question: do their state of mind, their squeals and giggles and childish
scuffling at the gate fit in with axes, bloodshed, fiendish cunning,
robbery? Theyâ€™d just killed them, not five or ten minutes before, for
the bodies were still warm, and at once, leaving the flat open, knowing
that people would go there at once, flinging away their booty, they
rolled about like children, laughing and attracting general attention.
NA
NA
â€œNo, brother, no _buts_. And if the ear-rings being found in Nikolayâ€™s
hands at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an important
piece of circumstantial evidence against him--although the explanation
given by him accounts for it, and therefore it does not tell seriously
against him--one must take into consideration the facts which prove him
innocent, especially as they are facts that _cannot be denied_. And
do you suppose, from the character of our legal system, that they will
accept, or that they are in a position to accept, this fact--resting
simply on a psychological impossibility--as irrefutable and conclusively
breaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution? No, they
wonâ€™t accept it, they certainly wonâ€™t, because they found the jewel-case
and the man tried to hang himself, â€˜which he could not have done if he
hadnâ€™t felt guilty.â€™ Thatâ€™s the point, thatâ€™s what excites me, you must
NA
â€œOh, I see you are excited! Wait a bit. I forgot to ask you; what proof
NA
NA
â€œKoch recognised the jewel-case and gave the name of the owner, who
NA
â€œThatâ€™s bad. Now another point. Did anyone see Nikolay at the time
that Koch and Pestryakov were going upstairs at first, and is there no
NA
NA
worst of it. Even Koch and Pestryakov did not notice them on their way
upstairs, though, indeed, their evidence could not have been worth much.
They said they saw the flat was open, and that there must be work going
on in it, but they took no special notice and could not remember whether
NA
â€œHm!... So the only evidence for the defence is that they were beating
one another and laughing. That constitutes a strong presumption, but...
NA
â€œHow do I explain them? What is there to explain? Itâ€™s clear. At any
rate, the direction in which explanation is to be sought is clear, and
the jewel-case points to it. The real murderer dropped those ear-rings.
The murderer was upstairs, locked in, when Koch and Pestryakov knocked
at the door. Koch, like an ass, did not stay at the door; so the
murderer popped out and ran down, too; for he had no other way of
escape. He hid from Koch, Pestryakov and the porter in the flat when
Nikolay and Dmitri had just run out of it. He stopped there while the
porter and others were going upstairs, waited till they were out of
hearing, and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when Dmitri
and Nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry;
possibly he was seen, but not noticed. There are lots of people going
in and out. He must have dropped the ear-rings out of his pocket when
he stood behind the door, and did not notice he dropped them, because he
had other things to think of. The jewel-case is a conclusive proof that
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
and a personage came in who was a stranger to all present.
CHAPTER V
This was a gentleman no longer young, of a stiff and portly appearance,
and a cautious and sour countenance. He began by stopping short in the
doorway, staring about him with offensive and undisguised astonishment,
as though asking himself what sort of place he had come to.
Mistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost
NA
same amazement he stared at Raskolnikov, who lay undressed, dishevelled,
unwashed, on his miserable dirty sofa, looking fixedly at him. Then with
the same deliberation he scrutinised the uncouth, unkempt figure and
unshaven face of Razumihin, who looked him boldly and inquiringly in the
face without rising from his seat. A constrained silence lasted for a
couple of minutes, and then, as might be expected, some scene-shifting
took place. Reflecting, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs,
NA
the gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, though with some severity,
emphasising every syllable of his question, addressed Zossimov:
NA
Zossimov made a slight movement, and would have answered, had not
Razumihin anticipated him.
NA
NA
feet of the pompous gentleman. He was turning to Razumihin, but checked
himself in time and turned to Zossimov again.
NA
gave a prolonged yawn, opening his mouth as wide as possible. Then he
lazily put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge gold
watch in a round hunterâ€™s case, opened it, looked at it and as slowly
and lazily proceeded to put it back.
Raskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, gazing
persistently, though without understanding, at the stranger. Now that
his face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper, it
was extremely pale and wore a look of anguish, as though he had just
undergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack. But
the new-comer gradually began to arouse his attention, then his wonder,
NA
 he jumped up quickly, sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant, but
weak and breaking, voice articulated:
NA
The visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressively:
â€œPyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. I believe I have reason to hope that my name
NA
But Raskolnikov, who had expected something quite different, gazed
blankly and dreamily at him, making no reply, as though he heard the
name of Pyotr Petrovitch for the first time.
â€œIs it possible that you can up to the present have received no
NA
In reply Raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow, put his hands
behind his head and gazed at the ceiling. A look of dismay came into
Luzhinâ€™s face. Zossimov and Razumihin stared at him more inquisitively
than ever, and at last he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment.
NA
NA
NA
suddenly. â€œIf youâ€™ve something to say, sit down. Nastasya and you are so
NA
He moved his chair back from the table, made a little space between the
table and his knees, and waited in a rather cramped position for the
NA
impossible to refuse, and the visitor squeezed his way through, hurrying
and stumbling. Reaching the chair, he sat down, looking suspiciously at
Razumihin.

the last five days and delirious for three, but now he is recovering and
has got an appetite. This is his doctor, who has just had a look at him.
I am a comrade of Rodyaâ€™s, like him, formerly a student, and now I am
nursing him; so donâ€™t you take any notice of us, but go on with your
NA
â€œThank you. But shall I not disturb the invalid by my presence and

NA
Razumihin, whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good-nature
that Pyotr Petrovitch began to be more cheerful, partly, perhaps,
because this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself as a
student.
NA
NA
inquiringly.
NA
Luzhin shrugged his shoulders.
â€œYour mamma had commenced a letter to you while I was sojourning in
her neighbourhood. On my arrival here I purposely allowed a few days to
elapse before coming to see you, in order that I might be fully
assured that you were in full possession of the tidings; but now, to my
NA
NA
NA
There was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitchâ€™s being offended this time,
but he said nothing. He made a violent effort to understand what it all
meant. There was a momentâ€™s silence.
Meanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards him when he
answered, began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity, as
though he had not had a good look at him yet, or as though something
new had struck him; he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at
him. There certainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitchâ€™s whole
NA
unceremoniously applied to him. In the first place, it was evident, far
too much so indeed, that Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use of his few
days in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation
of his betrothed--a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding,
indeed. Even his own, perhaps too complacent, consciousness of the
agreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such
circumstances, seeing that Pyotr Petrovitch had taken up the rÃ´le of
fiancÃ©. All his clothes were fresh from the tailorâ€™s and were all
right, except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate. Even
the stylish new round hat had the same significance. Pyotr Petrovitch
treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands. The
exquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, told the same tale,
if only from the fact of his not wearing them, but carrying them in
his hand for show. Light and youthful colours predominated in Pyotr
Petrovitchâ€™s attire. He wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade,
light thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a
cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and the best
of it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch. His very fresh and even
handsome face looked younger than his forty-five years at all times.
His dark, mutton-chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides,
growing thickly upon his shining, clean-shaven chin. Even his hair,
touched here and there with grey, though it had been combed and curled
at a hairdresserâ€™s, did not give him a stupid appearance, as curled hair
usually does, by inevitably suggesting a German on his wedding-day.
If there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his rather
good-looking and imposing countenance, it was due to quite other
causes. After scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously, Raskolnikov smiled
malignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as
before.
But Mr. Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take no
notice of their oddities.
NA
again breaking the silence with an effort. â€œIf I had been aware of your
illness I should have come earlier. But you know what business is. I
have, too, a very important legal affair in the Senate, not to mention
other preoccupations which you may well conjecture. I am expecting your

Raskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak; his face showed
some excitement. Pyotr Petrovitch paused, waited, but as nothing
followed, he went on:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œA disgusting place--filthy, stinking and, whatâ€™s more, of doubtful
character. Things have happened there, and there are all sorts of queer
people living there. And I went there about a scandalous business. Itâ€™s

addressing Raskolnikov, â€œand I am having it done up. And meanwhile I am
myself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend Andrey Semyonovitch

â€œYes, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, a clerk in the Ministry. Do you

â€œPracticality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from

enjoyment. â€œOf course, people do get carried away and make mistakes,
but one must have indulgence; those mistakes are merely evidence of
enthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment. If little
has been done, the time has been but short; of means I will not speak.
Itâ€™s my personal view, if you care to know, that something has been
accomplished already. New valuable ideas, new valuable works are
circulating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic authors.
Literature is taking a maturer form, many injurious prejudices have been
rooted up and turned into ridicule.... In a word, we have cut ourselves
off irrevocably from the past, and that, to my thinking, is a great

NA
is an advance, or, as they say now, progress in the name of science and
NA
NA
â€œNo, not a commonplace! Hitherto, for instance, if I were told, â€˜love
NA
excessive haste. â€œIt came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my
neighbour and we both were left half naked. As a Russian proverb has
it, â€˜Catch several hares and you wonâ€™t catch one.â€™ Science now tells
us, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests on
self-interest. You love yourself and manage your own affairs properly
and your coat remains whole. Economic truth adds that the better private
affairs are organised in society--the more whole coats, so to say--the
firmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare
organised too. Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for
myself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to bring to
pass my neighbourâ€™s getting a little more than a torn coat; and that not
from private, personal liberality, but as a consequence of the general
advance. The idea is simple, but unhappily it has been a long time
reaching us, being hindered by idealism and sentimentality. And yet it

NA
â€œand so let us drop it. I began this discussion with an object, but Iâ€™ve
grown so sick during the last three years of this chattering to amuse
oneself, of this incessant flow of commonplaces, always the same, that,
by Jove, I blush even when other people talk like that. You are in a
hurry, no doubt, to exhibit your acquirements; and I donâ€™t blame you,
thatâ€™s quite pardonable. I only wanted to find out what sort of man you
are, for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressive
cause of late and have so distorted in their own interests everything
they touched, that the whole cause has been dragged in the mire. Thatâ€™s

NA
NA
NA
concluded, and he turned abruptly to Zossimov to continue their previous
conversation.
Pyotr Petrovitch had the good sense to accept the disavowal. He made up
his mind to take leave in another minute or two.
NA

Raskolnikov did not even turn his head. Pyotr Petrovitch began getting
up from his chair.

you all off the scent. But I maintain that he is not cunning, not
practised, and probably this was his first crime! The supposition that
it was a calculated crime and a cunning criminal doesnâ€™t work. Suppose
him to have been inexperienced, and itâ€™s clear that it was only a chance
that saved him--and chance may do anything. Why, he did not foresee
obstacles, perhaps! And how did he set to work? He took jewels worth
ten or twenty roubles, stuffing his pockets with them, ransacked the
old womanâ€™s trunks, her rags--and they found fifteen hundred roubles,
besides notes, in a box in the top drawer of the chest! He did not know
how to rob; he could only murder. It was his first crime, I assure you,
his first crime; he lost his head. And he got off more by luck than good
NA
NA
Petrovitch put in, addressing Zossimov. He was standing, hat and gloves
in hand, but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more
intellectual phrases. He was evidently anxious to make a favourable
impression and his vanity overcame his prudence.
NA
NA
NA
â€œI canâ€™t say that; but another circumstance interests me in the
case--the whole question, so to say. Not to speak of the fact that crime
has been greatly on the increase among the lower classes during the last
five years, not to speak of the cases of robbery and arson everywhere,
what strikes me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes,
too, crime is increasing proportionately. In one place one hears of a
studentâ€™s robbing the mail on the high road; in another place people of
good social position forge false banknotes; in Moscow of late a whole
gang has been captured who used to forge lottery tickets, and one of
the ringleaders was a lecturer in universal history; then our secretary
abroad was murdered from some obscure motive of gain.... And if this old
woman, the pawnbroker, has been murdered by someone of a higher class
in society--for peasants donâ€™t pawn gold trinkets--how are we to explain
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhat answer had your lecturer in Moscow to make to the question why he
was forging notes? â€˜Everybody is getting rich one way or another, so I
want to make haste to get rich too.â€™ I donâ€™t remember the exact words,
but the upshot was that he wants money for nothing, without waiting or
working! Weâ€™ve grown used to having everything ready-made, to walking
on crutches, to having our food chewed for us. Then the great hour

NA
NA
NA
â€œWhy, carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now, and

Raskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching upper lip, breathing
painfully.

â€œEconomic ideas are not an incitement to murder, and one has but to

voice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him, â€œis it true that

assure you that the report which has reached you, or rather, let me say,
has been conveyed to you, has no foundation in truth, and I... suspect
who... in a word... this arrow... in a word, your mamma... She seemed

NA
NA
NA
But Luzhin was already leaving without finishing his speech, squeezing
between the table and the chair; Razumihin got up this time to let him
pass. Without glancing at anyone, and not even nodding to Zossimov, who
had for some time been making signs to him to let the sick man alone,
he went out, lifting his hat to the level of his shoulders to avoid
crushing it as he stooped to go out of the door. And even the curve of
his spine was expressive of the horrible insult he had received.

NA
Raskolnikov, left alone, looked with impatience and misery at Nastasya,
but she still lingered.
NA
NA
He turned abruptly to the wall; Nastasya went out.
CHAPTER VI
But as soon as she went out, he got up, latched the door, undid the
parcel which Razumihin had brought in that evening and had tied up again
and began dressing. Strange to say, he seemed immediately to have become
perfectly calm; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic
fear that had haunted him of late. It was the first moment of a strange
sudden calm. His movements were precise and definite; a firm purpose was
NA
that he was still weak, but his intense spiritual concentration gave him
strength and self-confidence. He hoped, moreover, that he would not
fall down in the street. When he had dressed in entirely new clothes, he
looked at the money lying on the table, and after a momentâ€™s thought
put it in his pocket. It was twenty-five roubles. He took also all the
copper change from the ten roubles spent by Razumihin on the clothes.
Then he softly unlatched the door, went out, slipped downstairs and
glanced in at the open kitchen door. Nastasya was standing with her back
to him, blowing up the landladyâ€™s samovar. She heard nothing. Who would
have dreamed of his going out, indeed? A minute later he was in the
street.
It was nearly eight oâ€™clock, the sun was setting. It was as stifling as
before, but he eagerly drank in the stinking, dusty town air. His head
felt rather dizzy; a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in his
feverish eyes and his wasted, pale and yellow face. He did not know and
did not think where he was going, he had one thought only: â€œthat all
_this_ must be ended to-day, once for all, immediately; that he would
not return home without it, because he _would not go on living like
NA
he did not even want to think of it. He drove away thought; thought
tortured him. All he knew, all he felt was that everything must be
NA
self-confidence and determination.
From old habit he took his usual walk in the direction of the Hay
Market. A dark-haired young man with a barrel organ was standing in
the road in front of a little general shop and was grinding out a very
sentimental song. He was accompanying a girl of fifteen, who stood
on the pavement in front of him. She was dressed up in a crinoline, a
mantle and a straw hat with a flame-coloured feather in it, all very
old and shabby. In a strong and rather agreeable voice, cracked and
coarsened by street singing, she sang in hope of getting a copper from
the shop. Raskolnikov joined two or three listeners, took out a five
copeck piece and put it in the girlâ€™s hand. She broke off abruptly on a

 and both moved on to the next shop.

man standing idly by him. The man looked at him, startled and wondering.
NA
manner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject--â€œI like it
on cold, dark, damp autumn evenings--they must be damp--when all the
passers-by have pale green, sickly faces, or better still when wet
snow is falling straight down, when thereâ€™s no wind--you know what I
NA
NA
question and Raskolnikovâ€™s strange manner, and he crossed over to the
other side of the street.
Raskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the corner of the Hay
Market, where the huckster and his wife had talked with Lizaveta; but
they were not there now. Recognising the place, he stopped, looked round
and addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a
corn chandlerâ€™s shop.
NA
NA
superciliously at Raskolnikov.
NA
NA
NA
The young man looked at Raskolnikov again.
â€œItâ€™s not a province, your excellency, but a district. Graciously
NA
NA
â€œYes, itâ€™s an eating-house and thereâ€™s a billiard-room and youâ€™ll find
NA
Raskolnikov crossed the square. In that corner there was a dense crowd
of peasants. He pushed his way into the thickest part of it, looking
at the faces. He felt an unaccountable inclination to enter into
conversation with people. But the peasants took no notice of him; they
were all shouting in groups together. He stood and thought a little and
took a turning to the right in the direction of V.
He had often crossed that little street which turns at an angle, leading
from the market-place to Sadovy Street. Of late he had often felt drawn
to wander about this district, when he felt depressed, that he might
feel more so.
Now he walked along, thinking of nothing. At that point there is a great
block of buildings, entirely let out in dram shops and eating-houses;
women were continually running in and out, bare-headed and in their
indoor clothes. Here and there they gathered in groups, on the pavement,
especially about the entrances to various festive establishments in
the lower storeys. From one of these a loud din, sounds of singing, the
tinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment, floated into the street.
A crowd of women were thronging round the door; some were sitting on the
steps, others on the pavement, others were standing talking. A drunken
soldier, smoking a cigarette, was walking near them in the road,
swearing; he seemed to be trying to find his way somewhere, but had
forgotten where. One beggar was quarrelling with another, and a man dead
drunk was lying right across the road. Raskolnikov joined the throng of
women, who were talking in husky voices. They were bare-headed and wore
cotton dresses and goatskin shoes. There were women of forty and some
not more than seventeen; almost all had blackened eyes.
He felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise and
uproar in the saloon below.... someone could be heard within dancing
frantically, marking time with his heels to the sounds of the guitar
and of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air. He listened intently,
gloomily and dreamily, bending down at the entrance and peeping
inquisitively in from the pavement.
  â€œOh, my handsome soldier
NA
trilled the thin voice of the singer. Raskolnikov felt a great desire to
make out what he was singing, as though everything depended on that.
NA
NA
NA
still musical and less thick than the others, she was young and not
repulsive--the only one of the group.
NA
She smiled, much pleased at the compliment.
NA
NA
NA
â€œTheyâ€™re all generalsâ€™ daughters, it seems, but they have all snub
NA
NA
NA
NA
And he darted down into the saloon below. Raskolnikov moved on.
NA
NA
She hesitated.
â€œIâ€™ll always be pleased to spend an hour with you, kind gentleman, but
now I feel shy. Give me six copecks for a drink, thereâ€™s a nice young
NA
Raskolnikov gave her what came first--fifteen copecks.

Raskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker. She was a pock-marked wench
of thirty, covered with bruises, with her upper lip swollen. She made

â€œWhere is it Iâ€™ve read that someone condemned to death says or thinks,

on such a narrow ledge that heâ€™d only room to stand, and the ocean,

him, if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his
life, a thousand years, eternity, it were better to live so than to die
at once! Only to live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be!...
How true it is! Good God, how true! Man is a vile creature!... And vile

He went into another street. â€œBah, the Palais de Cristal! Razumihin
was just talking of the Palais de Cristal. But what on earth was it
I wanted? Yes, the newspapers.... Zossimov said heâ€™d read it in the
NA
positively clean restaurant, consisting of several rooms, which were,
however, rather empty. Two or three people were drinking tea, and in a
room further away were sitting four men drinking champagne. Raskolnikov
fancied that Zametov was one of them, but he could not be sure at that
NA
NA
â€œGive me some tea and bring me the papers, the old ones for the last

NA
The old newspapers and the tea were brought. Raskolnikov sat down and
began to look through them.
â€œOh, damn... these are the items of intelligence. An accident on a
staircase, spontaneous combustion of a shopkeeper from alcohol, a fire
in Peski... a fire in the Petersburg quarter... another fire in the
Petersburg quarter... and another fire in the Petersburg quarter....
NA
read it. The lines danced before his eyes, but he read it all and began
eagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers. His hands
shook with nervous impatience as he turned the sheets. Suddenly someone
sat down beside him at his table. He looked up, it was the head clerk
Zametov, looking just the same, with the rings on his fingers and the
watch-chain, with the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded, with the
smart waistcoat, rather shabby coat and doubtful linen. He was in a good
humour, at least he was smiling very gaily and good-humouredly. His dark
face was rather flushed from the champagne he had drunk.

Raskolnikov knew he would come up to him. He laid aside the papers and
turned to Zametov. There was a smile on his lips, and a new shade of
irritable impatience was apparent in that smile.

to befriend, for whom you winked to the Explosive Lieutenant and he

â€œSixth class! Ah, my cock-sparrow! With your parting and your rings--you

broke into a nervous laugh right in Zametovâ€™s face. The latter drew
back, more amazed than offended.
NA
NA
â€œI am delirious? You are fibbing, my cock-sparrow! So I am strange? You
NA
NA
â€œShall I tell you what I was reading about, what I was looking for? See

â€œIâ€™ll explain that afterwards, but now, my boy, I declare to you... no,

came here on purpose to do it--for news of the murder of the old

his face exceedingly close to the face of Zametov. Zametov looked at him
steadily, without moving or drawing his face away. What struck Zametov
afterwards as the strangest part of it all was that silence followed for
exactly a minute, and that they gazed at one another all the while.
NA
NA
NA
heeding Zametovâ€™s explanation, â€œabout whom you were talking in the
police-office, you remember, when I fainted. Well, do you understand

NA
alarmed.
Raskolnikovâ€™s set and earnest face was suddenly transformed, and he
suddenly went off into the same nervous laugh as before, as though
utterly unable to restrain himself. And in one flash he recalled with
extraordinary vividness of sensation a moment in the recent past, that
moment when he stood with the axe behind the door, while the latch
trembled and the men outside swore and shook it, and he had a sudden
desire to shout at them, to swear at them, to put out his tongue at
them, to mock them, to laugh, and laugh, and laugh!
NA
stunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind.
NA
NA
Both were silent. After his sudden fit of laughter Raskolnikov became
suddenly thoughtful and melancholy. He put his elbow on the table and
leaned his head on his hand. He seemed to have completely forgotten
Zametov. The silence lasted for some time.
NA
NA
bread in his mouth and, suddenly looking at Zametov, seemed to remember
everything and pulled himself together. At the same moment his face
resumed its original mocking expression. He went on drinking tea.
NA
â€œOnly the other day I read in the _Moscow News_ that a whole gang of
false coiners had been caught in Moscow. It was a regular society. They
NA
NA
NA
smiling.
NA
â€œThey? They are children, simpletons, not criminals! Why, half a hundred
people meeting for such an object--what an idea! Three would be too
many, and then they want to have more faith in one another than in
themselves! One has only to blab in his cups and it all collapses.
Simpletons! They engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes--what
a thing to trust to a casual stranger! Well, let us suppose that these
simpletons succeed and each makes a million, and what follows for the
rest of their lives? Each is dependent on the others for the rest of his
life! Better hang oneself at once! And they did not know how to change
the notes either; the man who changed the notes took five thousand
roubles, and his hands trembled. He counted the first four thousand,
but did not count the fifth thousand--he was in such a hurry to get the
money into his pocket and run away. Of course he roused suspicion. And
NA
NA
possible. That, I feel quite sure, is possible. Sometimes one canâ€™t
NA
NA
â€œWhy, could you stand it then? No, I couldnâ€™t. For the sake of a hundred
roubles to face such a terrible experience? To go with false notes
into a bank where itâ€™s their business to spot that sort of thing! No, I
NA
NA
kept running down his spine.
NA
would change the notes: Iâ€™d count the first thousand three or four times
backwards and forwards, looking at every note and then Iâ€™d set to the
second thousand; Iâ€™d count that half-way through and then hold some
fifty-rouble note to the light, then turn it, then hold it to the light
again--to see whether it was a good one. â€˜I am afraid,â€™ I would say, â€˜a
relation of mine lost twenty-five roubles the other day through a
false note,â€™ and then Iâ€™d tell them the whole story. And after I began
counting the third, â€˜No, excuse me,â€™ I would say, â€˜I fancy I made a
mistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand, I am not sure.â€™
And so I would give up the third thousand and go back to the second and
so on to the end. And when I had finished, Iâ€™d pick out one from the
fifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light
and ask again, â€˜Change them, please,â€™ and put the clerk into such a stew
that he would not know how to get rid of me. When Iâ€™d finished and had
gone out, Iâ€™d come back, â€˜No, excuse me,â€™ and ask for some explanation.
NA
NA
that is only talk. I dare say when it came to deeds youâ€™d make a slip.
I believe that even a practised, desperate man cannot always reckon on
himself, much less you and I. To take an example near home--that old
woman murdered in our district. The murderer seems to have been a
desperate fellow, he risked everything in open daylight, was saved by
a miracle--but his hands shook, too. He did not succeed in robbing the

â€œWho? You? Do you suppose you could catch him? Youâ€™ve a tough job! A
great point for you is whether a man is spending money or not. If he had
no money and suddenly begins spending, he must be the man. So that any

Raskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at Zametov.

bringing his face close to Zametovâ€™s, again staring at him and speaking
in a whisper, so that the latter positively shuddered. â€œThis is what
I should have done. I should have taken the money and jewels, I should
have walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted place
with fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen, some kitchen garden
or place of that sort. I should have looked out beforehand some stone
weighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from
the time the house was built. I would lift that stone--there would sure
to be a hollow under it, and I would put the jewels and money in that
hole. Then Iâ€™d roll the stone back so that it would look as before,
would press it down with my foot and walk away. And for a year or two,
three maybe, I would not touch it. And, well, they could search! Thereâ€™d

NA
whisper, and moved away from Raskolnikov, whose eyes were glittering. He
had turned fearfully pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering.
He bent down as close as possible to Zametov, and his lips began to move
without uttering a word. This lasted for half a minute; he knew what he
was doing, but could not restrain himself. The terrible word trembled on
his lips, like the latch on that door; in another moment it will break
out, in another moment he will let it go, he will speak out.
NA
suddenly and--realised what he had done.
Zametov looked wildly at him and turned white as the tablecloth. His
face wore a contorted smile.
NA
wrathfully at him.
NA
NA
hastily.
â€œIâ€™ve caught my cock-sparrow! So you did believe it before, if now you

â€œYou donâ€™t believe it then? What were you talking about behind my
back when I went out of the police-office? And why did the explosive

held out his shaking hand to Zametov with notes in it. â€œRed notes and
blue, twenty-five roubles. Where did I get them? And where did my new
clothes come from? You know I had not a copeck. Youâ€™ve cross-examined my
landlady, Iâ€™ll be bound.... Well, thatâ€™s enough! _Assez causÃ©!_ Till we

He went out, trembling all over from a sort of wild hysterical
sensation, in which there was an element of insufferable rapture. Yet he
was gloomy and terribly tired. His face was twisted as after a fit.
His fatigue increased rapidly. Any shock, any irritating sensation
stimulated and revived his energies at once, but his strength failed as
quickly when the stimulus was removed.
Zametov, left alone, sat for a long time in the same place, plunged in
thought. Raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a revolution in his brain on
a certain point and had made up his mind for him conclusively.
NA
Raskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restaurant when he
stumbled against Razumihin on the steps. They did not see each other
till they almost knocked against each other. For a moment they stood
looking each other up and down. Razumihin was greatly astounded, then
anger, real anger gleamed fiercely in his eyes.
NA

went up to the garret. I almost beat Nastasya on your account. And here
he is after all. Rodya! What is the meaning of it? Tell me the whole

NA
 Raskolnikov answered calmly.
â€œAlone? When you are not able to walk, when your face is as white as a
sheet and you are gasping for breath! Idiot!... What have you been doing
NA
NA
for Razumihin; he gripped him firmly by the shoulder.
â€œLet you go? You dare tell me to let you go? Do you know what Iâ€™ll do
with you directly? Iâ€™ll pick you up, tie you up in a bundle, carry you
NA
NA
you see that I donâ€™t want your benevolence? A strange desire you have to
shower benefits on a man who... curses them, who feels them a burden in
fact! Why did you seek me out at the beginning of my illness? Maybe I
was very glad to die. Didnâ€™t I tell you plainly enough to-day that
you were torturing me, that I was... sick of you! You seem to want to
torture people! I assure you that all that is seriously hindering my
recovery, because itâ€™s continually irritating me. You saw Zossimov
went away just now to avoid irritating me. You leave me alone too, for
goodnessâ€™ sake! What right have you, indeed, to keep me by force? Donâ€™t
you see that I am in possession of all my faculties now? How, how can
I persuade you not to persecute me with your kindness? I may be
ungrateful, I may be mean, only let me be, for Godâ€™s sake, let me be!
NA
He began calmly, gloating beforehand over the venomous phrases he was
about to utter, but finished, panting for breath, in a frenzy, as he had
been with Luzhin.
Razumihin stood a moment, thought and let his hand drop.
NA
roared, as Raskolnikov was about to move. â€œListen to me. Let me tell
you, that you are all a set of babbling, posing idiots! If youâ€™ve any
little trouble you brood over it like a hen over an egg. And you are
plagiarists even in that! There isnâ€™t a sign of independent life in
you! You are made of spermaceti ointment and youâ€™ve lymph in your veins
instead of blood. I donâ€™t believe in anyone of you! In any circumstances
NA
cried with redoubled fury, noticing that Raskolnikov was again making
a movement--â€œhear me out! You know Iâ€™m having a house-warming this
evening, I dare say theyâ€™ve arrived by now, but I left my uncle there--I
just ran in--to receive the guests. And if you werenâ€™t a fool, a common
fool, a perfect fool, if you were an original instead of a translation...
you see, Rodya, I recognise youâ€™re a clever fellow, but youâ€™re a
fool!--and if you werenâ€™t a fool youâ€™d come round to me this evening
instead of wearing out your boots in the street! Since you have gone
out, thereâ€™s no help for it! Iâ€™d give you a snug easy chair, my landlady
has one... a cup of tea, company.... Or you could lie on the sofa--any

Raskolnikov walked on and turned the corner into Sadovy Street.
Razumihin looked after him thoughtfully. Then with a wave of his hand he
went into the house but stopped short of the stairs.
NA
I am a fool! As if madmen didnâ€™t talk sensibly! And this was just what
NA
if... how could I let him go off alone? He may drown himself.... Ach,
NA
there was no trace of him. With a curse he returned with rapid steps to
the Palais de Cristal to question Zametov.
Raskolnikov walked straight to X---- Bridge, stood in the middle, and
leaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance. On parting
with Razumihin, he felt so much weaker that he could scarcely reach this
place. He longed to sit or lie down somewhere in the street. Bending
over the water, he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the
sunset, at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight, at
one distant attic window on the left bank, flashing as though on fire in
the last rays of the setting sun, at the darkening water of the canal,
and the water seemed to catch his attention. At last red circles flashed
before his eyes, the houses seemed moving, the passers-by, the canal
banks, the carriages, all danced before his eyes. Suddenly he started,
saved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight. He
became aware of someone standing on the right side of him; he looked
and saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head, with a long, yellow,
wasted face and red sunken eyes. She was looking straight at him, but
obviously she saw nothing and recognised no one. Suddenly she leaned her
right hand on the parapet, lifted her right leg over the railing, then
her left and threw herself into the canal. The filthy water parted and
swallowed up its victim for a moment, but an instant later the drowning
woman floated to the surface, moving slowly with the current, her head
and legs in the water, her skirt inflated like a balloon over her back.

crowded about Raskolnikov, pressing up behind him.

boat; a policeman ran down the steps to the canal, threw off his great
coat and his boots and rushed into the water. It was easy to reach her:
she floated within a couple of yards from the steps, he caught hold of
her clothes with his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a
comrade held out to him; the drowning woman was pulled out at once. They
laid her on the granite pavement of the embankment. She soon recovered
consciousness, raised her head, sat up and began sneezing and coughing,
stupidly wiping her wet dress with her hands. She said nothing.

herself, we cut her down. I ran out to the shop just now, left my little
girl to look after her--and here sheâ€™s in trouble again! A neighbour,
gentleman, a neighbour, we live close by, the second house from the end,

The crowd broke up. The police still remained round the woman, someone
mentioned the police station.... Raskolnikov looked on with a strange
sensation of indifference and apathy. He felt disgusted. â€œNo, thatâ€™s

NA
police office...? And why isnâ€™t Zametov at the police office? The police

and looked about him.
NA
walked in the direction of the police office. His heart felt hollow and
empty. He did not want to think. Even his depression had passed, there
was not a trace now of the energy with which he had set out â€œto make an

NA
along the canal bank. â€œAnyway Iâ€™ll make an end, for I want to.... But
is it a way out? What does it matter! Thereâ€™ll be the square yard of
space--ha! But what an end! Is it really the end? Shall I tell them or
not? Ah... damn! How tired I am! If I could find somewhere to sit or lie
down soon! What I am most ashamed of is its being so stupid. But I donâ€™t
NA
To reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take the
second turning to the left. It was only a few paces away. But at the
first turning he stopped and, after a minuteâ€™s thought, turned into a
side street and went two streets out of his way, possibly without any
object, or possibly to delay a minute and gain time. He walked, looking
at the ground; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his ear; he lifted
his head and saw that he was standing at the very gate of _the_ house.
He had not passed it, he had not been near it since _that_ evening.
An overwhelming, unaccountable prompting drew him on. He went into the
house, passed through the gateway, then into the first entrance on the
right, and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth storey.
The narrow, steep staircase was very dark. He stopped at each landing
and looked round him with curiosity; on the first landing the framework

Here was the flat on the second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had been

NA
door of the flat wide open. There were men there, he could hear voices;
he had not expected that. After brief hesitation he mounted the last
stairs and went into the flat. It, too, was being done up; there were
workmen in it. This seemed to amaze him; he somehow fancied that he
would find everything as he left it, even perhaps the corpses in the
same places on the floor. And now, bare walls, no furniture; it seemed
strange. He walked to the window and sat down on the window-sill. There
were two workmen, both young fellows, but one much younger than the
other. They were papering the walls with a new white paper covered with
lilac flowers, instead of the old, dirty, yellow one. Raskolnikov for
some reason felt horribly annoyed by this. He looked at the new paper
with dislike, as though he felt sorry to have it all so changed.
The workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were
hurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home. They took
no notice of Raskolnikovâ€™s coming in; they were talking. Raskolnikov
folded his arms and listened.

declared sententiously.
Raskolnikov got up and walked into the other room where the strong box,
the bed, and the chest of drawers had been; the room seemed to him very
tiny without furniture in it. The paper was the same; the paper in the
corner showed where the case of ikons had stood. He looked at it and
went to the window. The elder workman looked at him askance.
NA
Instead of answering Raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the
bell. The same bell, the same cracked note. He rang it a second and
a third time; he listened and remembered. The hideous and agonisingly
fearful sensation he had felt then began to come back more and more
vividly. He shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more
satisfaction.

the two porters, a peasant woman, a man in a long coat and a few others.
Raskolnikov went straight up to them.

Raskolnikov made no reply, but stood beside them lost in thought.

NA
of the thoroughfare at the cross-roads, and he looked about him, as
though expecting from someone a decisive word. But no sound came, all
was dead and silent like the stones on which he walked, dead to him, to
him alone.... All at once at the end of the street, two hundred yards
away, in the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and shouts.
In the middle of the crowd stood a carriage.... A light gleamed in the
NA
and went up to the crowd. He seemed to clutch at everything and smiled
coldly when he recognised it, for he had fully made up his mind to go to
the police station and knew that it would all soon be over.
CHAPTER VII
An elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of
spirited grey horses; there was no one in it, and the coachman had got
off his box and stood by; the horses were being held by the bridle....
A mass of people had gathered round, the police standing in front. One
of them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lying
close to the wheels. Everyone was talking, shouting, exclaiming; the
coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating:
NA
Raskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could, and succeeded at last
in seeing the object of the commotion and interest. On the ground a
man who had been run over lay apparently unconscious, and covered with
blood; he was very badly dressed, but not like a workman. Blood was
flowing from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated and
disfigured. He was evidently badly injured.
NA
been driving fast or had not shouted to him, but I was going quietly,
not in a hurry. Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody
else. A drunken man canâ€™t walk straight, we all know.... I saw him
crossing the street, staggering and almost falling. I shouted again
and a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he fell
straight under their feet! Either he did it on purpose or he was very
tipsy.... The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started,
NA
NA
NA
declared.
NA
But the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened. It was
evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who
was awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no little
anxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements. All they had to do was to
take the injured man to the police station and the hospital. No one knew
his name.
Meanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him. The
lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate manâ€™s face. He recognised
him.

government clerk retired from the service, Marmeladov. He lives close
NA
pulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman. He was in
violent agitation.
The police were glad that they had found out who the man was.
Raskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, as earnestly as if it
had been his father, he besought the police to carry the unconscious
Marmeladov to his lodging at once.
NA
Kozel, a rich German. He was going home, no doubt drunk. I know him,
he is a drunkard. He has a family there, a wife, children, he has one
daughter.... It will take time to take him to the hospital, and there is
sure to be a doctor in the house. Iâ€™ll pay, Iâ€™ll pay! At least he will
be looked after at home... they will help him at once. But heâ€™ll die
NA
unseen into the policemanâ€™s hand. But the thing was straightforward
and legitimate, and in any case help was closer here. They raised the
injured man; people volunteered to help.
Kozelâ€™s house was thirty yards away. Raskolnikov walked behind,
carefully holding Marmeladovâ€™s head and showing the way.
â€œThis way, this way! We must take him upstairs head foremost. Turn

Katerina Ivanovna had just begun, as she always did at every free
moment, walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and
back again, with her arms folded across her chest, talking to herself
and coughing. Of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest
girl, Polenka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she did not
understand, understood very well that her mother needed her, and so
always watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost
to appear to understand. This time Polenka was undressing her little
brother, who had been unwell all day and was going to bed. The boy was
waiting for her to take off his shirt, which had to be washed at night.
He was sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent,
serious face, with his legs stretched out straight before him--heels
together and toes turned out.
He was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister, sitting
perfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes, just as all good
little boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed. A little
girl, still younger, dressed literally in rags, stood at the screen,
waiting for her turn. The door on to the stairs was open to relieve
them a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the
other rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor,
consumptive woman. Katerina Ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner
during that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than
ever.
NA
about the room, â€œwhat a happy luxurious life we had in my papaâ€™s house
and how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin!
Papa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that

girl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking-up?â€™ (You must mend
that tear, you must take your needle and darn it as I showed you, or
NA
articulated with effort.) â€œPrince Schegolskoy, a kammerjunker, had just
come from Petersburg then... he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to
make me an offer next day; but I thanked him in flattering expressions
and told him that my heart had long been anotherâ€™s. That other was your
father, Polya; papa was fearfully angry.... Is the water ready? Give me

work two nights running! Oh, dear! (Cough, cough, cough, cough!) Again!

Marmeladov, unconscious and covered with blood, had been carried in.

 Raskolnikov showed him.

Katerina Ivanovna stood, turning white and gasping for breath. The
children were terrified. Little Lida screamed, rushed to Polenka and
clutched at her, trembling all over.
Having laid Marmeladov down, Raskolnikov flew to Katerina Ivanovna.
NA
quickly, â€œhe was crossing the road and was run over by a carriage, donâ€™t
be frightened, he will come to, I told them bring him here... Iâ€™ve been

NA
rushed to her husband.
Raskolnikov noticed at once that she was not one of those women who
swoon easily. She instantly placed under the luckless manâ€™s head a
pillow, which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining
him. She kept her head, forgetting herself, biting her trembling lips
and stifling the screams which were ready to break from her.
Raskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor. There was a
doctor, it appeared, next door but one.
NA
uneasy, Iâ€™ll pay. Havenâ€™t you water?... and give me a napkin or a towel,
anything, as quick as you can.... He is injured, but not killed, believe
NA
Katerina Ivanovna ran to the window; there, on a broken chair in the
corner, a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood, in
readiness for washing her childrenâ€™s and husbandâ€™s linen that night.
This washing was done by Katerina Ivanovna at night at least twice a
week, if not oftener. For the family had come to such a pass that they
were practically without change of linen, and Katerina Ivanovna could
not endure uncleanliness and, rather than see dirt in the house, she
preferred to wear herself out at night, working beyond her strength when
the rest were asleep, so as to get the wet linen hung on a line and dry
by the morning. She took up the basin of water at Raskolnikovâ€™s request,
but almost fell down with her burden. But the latter had already
succeeded in finding a towel, wetted it and began washing the blood off
Marmeladovâ€™s face.
Katerina Ivanovna stood by, breathing painfully and pressing her hands
to her breast. She was in need of attention herself. Raskolnikov began
to realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured man
brought here. The policeman, too, stood in hesitation.
NA
donâ€™t find her at home, leave word that her father has been run over
and that she is to come here at once... when she comes in. Run, Polenka!
NA
NA
which he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity, with round eyes, his
heels thrust forward and his toes spread out.
Meanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldnâ€™t have
dropped a pin. The policemen left, all except one, who remained for a
time, trying to drive out the people who came in from the stairs. Almost
all Madame Lippevechselâ€™s lodgers had streamed in from the inner rooms
of the flat; at first they were squeezed together in the doorway, but
afterwards they overflowed into the room. Katerina Ivanovna flew into a
fury.
NA
â€œis it a spectacle for you to gape at? With cigarettes! (Cough, cough,
cough!) You might as well keep your hats on.... And there is one in his

Her cough choked her--but her reproaches were not without result. They
evidently stood in some awe of Katerina Ivanovna. The lodgers, one after
another, squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling
of satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden
accident, even in those nearest and dearest to the victim, from which
no living man is exempt, even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and
compassion.
Voices outside were heard, however, speaking of the hospital and saying
that theyâ€™d no business to make a disturbance here.
NA
the door to vent her wrath upon them, but in the doorway came face to
face with Madame Lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accident
and ran in to restore order. She was a particularly quarrelsome and
irresponsible German.

 Katerina Ivanovna began haughtily (she always took a haughty tone with

â€œYou are not Amalia Ivanovna, but Amalia Ludwigovna, and as I am not

behind the door at this moment (a laugh and a cry of â€˜they are at it
againâ€™ was in fact audible at the door) so I shall always call you
Amalia Ludwigovna, though I fail to understand why you dislike that
name. You can see for yourself what has happened to Semyon Zaharovitch;
he is dying. I beg you to close that door at once and to admit no one.
Let him at least die in peace! Or I warn you the Governor-General,
himself, shall be informed of your conduct to-morrow. The prince knew
me as a girl; he remembers Semyon Zaharovitch well and has often been
a benefactor to him. Everyone knows that Semyon Zaharovitch had many
friends and protectors, whom he abandoned himself from an honourable
pride, knowing his unhappy weakness, but now (she pointed to
Raskolnikov) a generous young man has come to our assistance, who has
wealth and connections and whom Semyon Zaharovitch has known from a

All this was uttered with extreme rapidity, getting quicker and quicker,
but a cough suddenly cut short Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s eloquence. At that
instant the dying man recovered consciousness and uttered a groan; she
ran to him. The injured man opened his eyes and without recognition or
understanding gazed at Raskolnikov who was bending over him. He drew
deep, slow, painful breaths; blood oozed at the corners of his mouth
and drops of perspiration came out on his forehead. Not recognising
Raskolnikov, he began looking round uneasily. Katerina Ivanovna looked
at him with a sad but stern face, and tears trickled from her eyes.
NA
in despair. â€œWe must take off his clothes. Turn a little, Semyon

Marmeladov recognised her.

Katerina Ivanovna walked to the window, laid her head against the window
frame and exclaimed in despair:

returned and stood by his pillow. He seemed a little easier but not for
long.
Soon his eyes rested on little Lida, his favourite, who was shaking in
the corner, as though she were in a fit, and staring at him with her
wondering childish eyes.

childâ€™s bare feet.

The doctor came in, a precise little old man, a German, looking about
him mistrustfully; he went up to the sick man, took his pulse, carefully
felt his head and with the help of Katerina Ivanovna he unbuttoned the
blood-stained shirt, and bared the injured manâ€™s chest. It was gashed,
crushed and fractured, several ribs on the right side were broken.
On the left side, just over the heart, was a large, sinister-looking
yellowish-black bruise--a cruel kick from the horseâ€™s hoof. The doctor
frowned. The policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and
turned round with it for thirty yards on the road.

whispered softly to Raskolnikov.
NA
NA
NA
â€œNot the faintest! He is at the last gasp.... His head is badly injured,
too... Hm... I could bleed him if you like, but... it would be useless.
NA
NA
NA
At that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the passage parted,
and the priest, a little, grey old man, appeared in the doorway bearing
the sacrament. A policeman had gone for him at the time of the accident.
The doctor changed places with him, exchanging glances with him.
Raskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while. He shrugged his
shoulders and remained.
All stepped back. The confession was soon over. The dying man probably
understood little; he could only utter indistinct broken sounds.
Katerina Ivanovna took little Lida, lifted the boy from the chair, knelt
down in the corner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of
her. The little girl was still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on his
little bare knees, lifted his hand rhythmically, crossing himself with
precision and bowed down, touching the floor with his forehead, which
seemed to afford him especial satisfaction. Katerina Ivanovna bit her
lips and held back her tears; she prayed, too, now and then pulling
straight the boyâ€™s shirt, and managed to cover the girlâ€™s bare shoulders
with a kerchief, which she took from the chest without rising from her
knees or ceasing to pray. Meanwhile the door from the inner rooms was
opened inquisitively again. In the passage the crowd of spectators from
all the flats on the staircase grew denser and denser, but they did not
venture beyond the threshold. A single candle-end lighted up the scene.
At that moment Polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door. She
came in panting from running so fast, took off her kerchief, looked for
her mother, went up to her and said, â€œSheâ€™s coming, I met her in the
NA
Timidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd,
and strange was her appearance in that room, in the midst of want, rags,
death and despair. She, too, was in rags, her attire was all of
the cheapest, but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp,
unmistakably betraying its shameful purpose. Sonia stopped short in the
doorway and looked about her bewildered, unconscious of everything.
She forgot her fourth-hand, gaudy silk dress, so unseemly here with
its ridiculous long train, and her immense crinoline that filled up the
whole doorway, and her light-coloured shoes, and the parasol she brought
with her, though it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw hat
with its flaring flame-coloured feather. Under this rakishly-tilted hat
was a pale, frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in
terror. Sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair, rather
pretty, with wonderful blue eyes. She looked intently at the bed and the
priest; she too was out of breath with running. At last whispers, some
words in the crowd probably, reached her. She looked down and took a
step forward into the room, still keeping close to the door.
The service was over. Katerina Ivanovna went up to her husband again.
The priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition and
consolation to Katerina Ivanovna on leaving.

Katerina Ivanovna was busy with the dying man; she was giving him water,
wiping the blood and sweat from his head, setting his pillow straight,
and had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest. Now
she flew at him almost in a frenzy.
â€œAh, father! Thatâ€™s words and only words! Forgive! If heâ€™d not been run
over, heâ€™d have come home to-day drunk and his only shirt dirty and
in rags and heâ€™d have fallen asleep like a log, and I should have been
sousing and rinsing till daybreak, washing his rags and the childrenâ€™s
and then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight I
should have been darning them. Thatâ€™s how I spend my nights!... Whatâ€™s
NA
A terrible hollow cough interrupted her words. She put her handkerchief
to her lips and showed it to the priest, pressing her other hand to her
aching chest. The handkerchief was covered with blood. The priest bowed
his head and said nothing.
Marmeladov was in the last agony; he did not take his eyes off the face
of Katerina Ivanovna, who was bending over him again. He kept trying
to say something to her; he began moving his tongue with difficulty and
articulating indistinctly, but Katerina Ivanovna, understanding that he
wanted to ask her forgiveness, called peremptorily to him:
NA
was silent, but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to the
doorway and he saw Sonia.
Till then he had not noticed her: she was standing in the shadow in a
corner.
NA
in agitation, turning his eyes in horror towards the door where his
daughter was standing, and trying to sit up.
NA
With unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping himself on his
elbow. He looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter, as
though not recognising her. He had never seen her before in such attire.
Suddenly he recognised her, crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and
gaudy finery, meekly awaiting her turn to say good-bye to her dying
father. His face showed intense suffering.
NA
to her, but losing his balance, he fell off the sofa, face downwards on
the floor. They rushed to pick him up, they put him on the sofa; but he
was dying. Sonia with a faint cry ran up, embraced him and remained so
without moving. He died in her arms.

reverence. From that evening, when I learnt how devoted he was to you
all and how he loved and respected you especially, Katerina Ivanovna,
in spite of his unfortunate weakness, from that evening we became
friends.... Allow me now... to do something... to repay my debt to my
dead friend. Here are twenty roubles, I think--and if that can be of any
assistance to you, then... I... in short, I will come again, I will
be sure to come again... I shall, perhaps, come again to-morrow....
NA
And he went quickly out of the room, squeezing his way through the crowd
to the stairs. But in the crowd he suddenly jostled against Nikodim
Fomitch, who had heard of the accident and had come to give instructions
in person. They had not met since the scene at the police station, but
Nikodim Fomitch knew him instantly.

then he smiled, nodded and went downstairs.
He walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but not conscious
of it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and
strength that surged up suddenly within him. This sensation might be
compared to that of a man condemned to death who has suddenly been
pardoned. Halfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest on
his way home; Raskolnikov let him pass, exchanging a silent greeting
with him. He was just descending the last steps when he heard rapid
footsteps behind him. Someone overtook him; it was Polenka. She was

He turned round. She was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped
short a step above him. A dim light came in from the yard. Raskolnikov
could distinguish the childâ€™s thin but pretty little face, looking at
him with a bright childish smile. She had run after him with a message
which she was evidently glad to give.
NA
hurriedly in a breathless voice.
He laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her with a sort of
rapture. It was such a joy to him to look at her, he could not have said
why.

NA
NA
â€œMamma sent me, too... when sister Sonia was sending me, mamma came up,

By way of answer he saw the little girlâ€™s face approaching him, her full
lips naÃ¯vely held out to kiss him. Suddenly her arms as thin as sticks
held him tightly, her head rested on his shoulder and the little girl
wept softly, pressing her face against him.

NA
â€œOf course, we do! We knew them long ago. I say my prayers to myself
as I am a big girl now, but Kolya and Lida say them aloud with mother.
First they repeat the â€˜Ave Mariaâ€™ and then another prayer: â€˜Lord,

bless our second father.â€™ For our elder father is dead and this is

hotly, and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him and hugged him
warmly once more.
Raskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to be sure to
come next day. The child went away quite enchanted with him. It was past
ten when he came out into the street. In five minutes he was standing on
the bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in.
NA
fancies, imaginary terrors and phantoms! Life is real! havenâ€™t I lived
just now? My life has not yet died with that old woman! The Kingdom of
Heaven to her--and now enough, madam, leave me in peace! Now for the
reign of reason and light... and of will, and of strength... and now
NA
challenging some power of darkness. â€œAnd I was ready to consent to live
in a square of space!
â€œI am very weak at this moment, but... I believe my illness is all over.
I knew it would be over when I went out. By the way, Potchinkovâ€™s house
is only a few steps away. I certainly must go to Razumihin even if
it were not close by... let him win his bet! Let us give him some
satisfaction, too--no matter! Strength, strength is what one wants, you
can get nothing without it, and strength must be won by strength--thatâ€™s
NA
he walked with flagging footsteps from the bridge. Pride and
self-confidence grew continually stronger in him; he was becoming
a different man every moment. What was it had happened to work this
revolution in him? He did not know himself; like a man catching at a
straw, he suddenly felt that he, too, â€˜could live, that there was still
life for him, that his life had not died with the old woman.â€™ Perhaps he
was in too great a hurry with his conclusions, but he did not think of
that.
NA
NA
laughed himself at his boyish sally. He was in the best of spirits.
He easily found Razumihin; the new lodger was already known at
Potchinkovâ€™s and the porter at once showed him the way. Half-way
upstairs he could hear the noise and animated conversation of a big
gathering of people. The door was wide open on the stairs; he could
hear exclamations and discussion. Razumihinâ€™s room was fairly large; the
company consisted of fifteen people. Raskolnikov stopped in the entry,
where two of the landladyâ€™s servants were busy behind a screen with two
samovars, bottles, plates and dishes of pie and savouries, brought up
from the landladyâ€™s kitchen. Raskolnikov sent in for Razumihin. He ran
out delighted. At the first glance it was apparent that he had had a
great deal to drink and, though no amount of liquor made Razumihin quite
drunk, this time he was perceptibly affected by it.
NA
youâ€™ve won your bet and that no one really knows what may not happen to
him. I canâ€™t come in; I am so weak that I shall fall down directly. And
NA
â€œDo you know what? Iâ€™ll see you home. If you say youâ€™re weak yourself,
NA
â€œAnd your visitors? Who is the curly-headed one who has just peeped
NA
â€œHe? Goodness only knows! Some friend of uncleâ€™s, I expect, or perhaps
he has come without being invited... Iâ€™ll leave uncle with them, he
is an invaluable person, pity I canâ€™t introduce you to him now. But
confound them all now! They wonâ€™t notice me, and I need a little fresh
air, for youâ€™ve come just in the nick of time--another two minutes and I
should have come to blows! They are talking such a lot of wild stuff...
you simply canâ€™t imagine what men will say! Though why shouldnâ€™t you
imagine? Donâ€™t we talk nonsense ourselves? And let them... thatâ€™s the

Zossimov pounced upon Raskolnikov almost greedily; he showed a special
interest in him; soon his face brightened.

NA
Razumihin--â€œwe shall see how he is to-morrow, to-day heâ€™s not at all

 Razumihin blurted out, as soon as they were in the street. â€œI wonâ€™t tell
you everything, brother, because they are such fools. Zossimov told me
to talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me, and
afterwards I am to tell him about it, for heâ€™s got a notion in his head
that you are... mad or close on it. Only fancy! In the first place,
youâ€™ve three times the brains he has; in the second, if you are not mad,
you neednâ€™t care a hang that he has got such a wild idea; and thirdly,
that piece of beef whose specialty is surgery has gone mad on mental
diseases, and whatâ€™s brought him to this conclusion about you was your

NA
â€œYes, and he did well. Now I understand what it all means and so does
Zametov.... Well, the fact is, Rodya... the point is... I am a little
drunk now.... But thatâ€™s... no matter... the point is that this
idea... you understand? was just being hatched in their brains... you
understand? That is, no one ventured to say it aloud, because the idea
is too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter, that
bubbleâ€™s burst and gone for ever. But why are they such fools? I gave
Zametov a bit of a thrashing at the time--thatâ€™s between ourselves,
brother; please donâ€™t let out a hint that you know of it; Iâ€™ve noticed
he is a ticklish subject; it was at Luise Ivanovnaâ€™s. But to-day, to-day
itâ€™s all cleared up. That Ilya Petrovitch is at the bottom of it! He
took advantage of your fainting at the police station, but he is ashamed

Raskolnikov listened greedily. Razumihin was drunk enough to talk too
freely.
NA
Raskolnikov.
â€œNo need to explain that! And it wasnâ€™t the paint only: the fever had
been coming on for a month; Zossimov testifies to that! But how crushed
that boy is now, you wouldnâ€™t believe! â€˜I am not worth his little
finger,â€™ he says. Yours, he means. He has good feelings at times,
brother. But the lesson, the lesson you gave him to-day in the Palais
de Cristal, that was too good for anything! You frightened him at first,
you know, he nearly went into convulsions! You almost convinced
him again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense, and then you
suddenly--put out your tongue at him: â€˜There now, what do you make of
it?â€™ It was perfect! He is crushed, annihilated now! It was masterly, by
Jove, itâ€™s what they deserve! Ah, that I wasnâ€™t there! He was hoping to

NA
â€œOh, not mad. I must have said too much, brother.... What struck him,
you see, was that only that subject seemed to interest you; now itâ€™s
clear why it did interest you; knowing all the circumstances... and
how that irritated you and worked in with your illness... I am a little
drunk, brother, only, confound him, he has some idea of his own... I

For half a minute both were silent.

They were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs, at the level
of the landladyâ€™s door, and they could, as a fact, see from below that
there was a light in Raskolnikovâ€™s garret.

His mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had been waiting an
hour and a half for him. Why had he never expected, never thought of
them, though the news that they had started, were on their way and would
arrive immediately, had been repeated to him only that day? They had
spent that hour and a half plying Nastasya with questions. She was

in anguish for that hour and a half.
A cry of joy, of ecstasy, greeted Raskolnikovâ€™s entrance. Both rushed to
him. But he stood like one dead; a sudden intolerable sensation struck
him like a thunderbolt. He did not lift his arms to embrace them, he
could not. His mother and sister clasped him in their arms, kissed him,
laughed and cried. He took a step, tottered and fell to the ground,
fainting.
Anxiety, cries of horror, moans... Razumihin who was standing in the
doorway flew into the room, seized the sick man in his strong arms and
in a moment had him on the sofa.

PART III
CHAPTER I
Raskolnikov got up, and sat down on the sofa. He waved his hand weakly
to Razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations
he was addressing to his mother and sister, took them both by the hand
and for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking.
His mother was alarmed by his expression. It revealed an emotion
agonisingly poignant, and at the same time something immovable, almost
insane. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.
Avdotya Romanovna was pale; her hand trembled in her brotherâ€™s.
NA
â€œgood-bye till to-morrow; to-morrow everything... Is it long since you

â€œNo, Rodya, but he knows already of our arrival. We have heard, Rodya,

Alexandrovna added somewhat timidly.
â€œYes... he was so kind... Dounia, I promised Luzhin Iâ€™d throw him
NA
NA
 Pulcheria Alexandrovna began in alarm, but she stopped, looking at
Dounia.
Avdotya Romanovna was looking attentively at her brother, waiting
for what would come next. Both of them had heard of the quarrel from
Nastasya, so far as she had succeeded in understanding and reporting it,
and were in painful perplexity and suspense.

To-morrow all this nonsense will be over... to-day he certainly did
drive him away. That was so. And Luzhin got angry, too.... He made
speeches here, wanted to show off his learning and he went out

did not and perhaps could not answer. He lay down on the sofa, and
turned to the wall, utterly exhausted. Avdotya Romanovna looked with
interest at Razumihin; her black eyes flashed; Razumihin positively
started at her glance.
Pulcheria Alexandrovna stood overwhelmed.

he was almost beating the doctor and me this afternoon! Do you
understand? The doctor himself! Even he gave way and left him, so as not
to irritate him. I remained downstairs on guard, but he dressed at once
and slipped off. And he will slip off again if you irritate him, at this

â€œIâ€™ll beseech her to find some corner for Dounia and me for the night. I

This conversation took place on the landing just before the landladyâ€™s
door. Nastasya lighted them from a step below. Razumihin was in
extraordinary excitement. Half an hour earlier, while he was bringing
Raskolnikov home, he had indeed talked too freely, but he was aware of
it himself, and his head was clear in spite of the vast quantities he
had imbibed. Now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy, and all that he
had drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect. He stood with
the two ladies, seizing both by their hands, persuading them, and giving
them reasons with astonishing plainness of speech, and at almost every
word he uttered, probably to emphasise his arguments, he squeezed their
hands painfully as in a vise. He stared at Avdotya Romanovna without the
least regard for good manners. They sometimes pulled their hands out of
his huge bony paws, but far from noticing what was the matter, he drew
them all the closer to him. If theyâ€™d told him to jump head foremost
from the staircase, he would have done it without thought or hesitation
in their service. Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna felt that the young man
was really too eccentric and pinched her hand too much, in her anxiety
over her Rodya she looked on his presence as providential, and was
unwilling to notice all his peculiarities. But though Avdotya Romanovna
shared her anxiety, and was not of timorous disposition, she could not
see the glowing light in his eyes without wonder and almost alarm. It
was only the unbounded confidence inspired by Nastasyaâ€™s account of her
brotherâ€™s queer friend, which prevented her from trying to run away from
him, and to persuade her mother to do the same. She realised, too,
that even running away was perhaps impossible now. Ten minutes later,
however, she was considerably reassured; it was characteristic of
Razumihin that he showed his true nature at once, whatever mood he might
be in, so that people quickly saw the sort of man they had to deal with.
NA
you stay, though you are his mother, youâ€™ll drive him to a frenzy, and
then goodness knows what will happen! Listen, Iâ€™ll tell you what Iâ€™ll
do: Nastasya will stay with him now, and Iâ€™ll conduct you both home, you
canâ€™t be in the streets alone; Petersburg is an awful place in that
way.... But no matter! Then Iâ€™ll run straight back here and a quarter of
an hour later, on my word of honour, Iâ€™ll bring you news how he is,
whether he is asleep, and all that. Then, listen! Then Iâ€™ll run home in
a twinkling--Iâ€™ve a lot of friends there, all drunk--Iâ€™ll fetch
Zossimov--thatâ€™s the doctor who is looking after him, he is there, too,
but he is not drunk; he is not drunk, he is never drunk! Iâ€™ll drag him
to Rodya, and then to you, so that youâ€™ll get two reports in the
hour--from the doctor, you understand, from the doctor himself, thatâ€™s a
very different thing from my account of him! If thereâ€™s anything wrong,
I swear Iâ€™ll bring you here myself, but, if itâ€™s all right, you go to
bed. And Iâ€™ll spend the night here, in the passage, he wonâ€™t hear me,
and Iâ€™ll tell Zossimov to sleep at the landladyâ€™s, to be at hand. Which
is better for him: you or the doctor? So come home then! But the
landlady is out of the question; itâ€™s all right for me, but itâ€™s out of
the question for you: she wouldnâ€™t take you, for sheâ€™s... for sheâ€™s a
fool... Sheâ€™d be jealous on my account of Avdotya Romanovna and of you,
too, if you want to know... of Avdotya Romanovna certainly. She is an
absolutely, absolutely unaccountable character! But I am a fool, too!...
NA
NA
he has promised. He has saved Rodya already, and if the doctor really
NA
NA
 Razumihin cried in ecstasy, â€œlet us go! Nastasya! Fly upstairs and sit
NA
Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna was not perfectly convinced, she made no
further resistance. Razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down
the stairs. He still made her uneasy, as though he was competent and
good-natured, was he capable of carrying out his promise? He seemed in
such a condition....
NA
her thoughts, guessing them, as he strolled along the pavement with huge
steps, so that the two ladies could hardly keep up with him, a fact he
did not observe, however. â€œNonsense! That is... I am drunk like a fool,
but thatâ€™s not it; I am not drunk from wine. Itâ€™s seeing you has turned
my head... But donâ€™t mind me! Donâ€™t take any notice: I am talking
nonsense, I am not worthy of you.... I am utterly unworthy of you! The
minute Iâ€™ve taken you home, Iâ€™ll pour a couple of pailfuls of water over
my head in the gutter here, and then I shall be all right.... If only
you knew how I love you both! Donâ€™t laugh, and donâ€™t be angry! You may
be angry with anyone, but not with me! I am his friend, and therefore I
am your friend, too, I want to be... I had a presentiment... Last year
there was a moment... though it wasnâ€™t a presentiment really, for
you seem to have fallen from heaven. And I expect I shanâ€™t sleep all
night... Zossimov was afraid a little time ago that he would go mad...
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, but itâ€™s not so, not a bit of it. He gave him some medicine, a
powder, I saw it, and then your coming here.... Ah! It would have been
better if you had come to-morrow. Itâ€™s a good thing we went away. And in
an hour Zossimov himself will report to you about everything. He is not
drunk! And I shanâ€™t be drunk.... And what made me get so tight? Because
they got me into an argument, damn them! Iâ€™ve sworn never to argue! They
talk such trash! I almost came to blows! Iâ€™ve left my uncle to preside.
Would you believe, they insist on complete absence of individualism
and thatâ€™s just what they relish! Not to be themselves, to be as unlike
themselves as they can. Thatâ€™s what they regard as the highest point of
NA
NA
fuel to the flames.
NA
am attacking them for talking nonsense? Not a bit! I like them to talk
nonsense. Thatâ€™s manâ€™s one privilege over all creation. Through error
you come to the truth! I am a man because I err! You never reach any
truth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and
fourteen. And a fine thing, too, in its way; but we canâ€™t even make
mistakes on our own account! Talk nonsense, but talk your own nonsense,
and Iâ€™ll kiss you for it. To go wrong in oneâ€™s own way is better than
to go right in someone elseâ€™s. In the first case you are a man, in the
second youâ€™re no better than a bird. Truth wonâ€™t escape you, but life
can be cramped. There have been examples. And what are we doing now?
In science, development, thought, invention, ideals, aims, liberalism,
judgment, experience and everything, everything, everything, we are
still in the preparatory class at school. We prefer to live on other

â€œNot for anything till you let me kiss your hands! Thatâ€™s it! Enough! I

homage to you is the duty of every man who is not a perfect beast! And
Iâ€™ve done homage.... Here are your lodgings, and for that alone Rodya
was right in driving your Pyotr Petrovitch away.... How dare he! how
dare he put you in such lodgings! Itâ€™s a scandal! Do you know the
sort of people they take in here? And you his betrothed! You are
his betrothed? Yes? Well, then, Iâ€™ll tell you, your _fiancÃ©_ is a

 Razumihin made haste to apologise. â€œBut... but you canâ€™t be angry with
me for speaking so! For I speak sincerely and not because... hm, hm!
That would be disgraceful; in fact not because Iâ€™m in... hm! Well,
anyway, I wonâ€™t say why, I darenâ€™t.... But we all saw to-day when he
came in that that man is not of our sort. Not because he had his hair
curled at the barberâ€™s, not because he was in such a hurry to show his
wit, but because he is a spy, a speculator, because he is a skin-flint
and a buffoon. Thatâ€™s evident. Do you think him clever? No, he is a
fool, a fool. And is he a match for you? Good heavens! Do you see,
NA
all my friends there are drunk, yet they are all honest, and though we
do talk a lot of trash, and I do, too, yet we shall talk our way to the
truth at last, for we are on the right path, while Pyotr Petrovitch...
is not on the right path. Though Iâ€™ve been calling them all sorts of
names just now, I do respect them all... though I donâ€™t respect Zametov,
I like him, for he is a puppy, and that bullock Zossimov, because he
is an honest man and knows his work. But enough, itâ€™s all said and
forgiven. Is it forgiven? Well, then, letâ€™s go on. I know this corridor,
Iâ€™ve been here, there was a scandal here at Number 3.... Where are you
here? Which number? eight? Well, lock yourselves in for the night, then.
Donâ€™t let anybody in. In a quarter of an hour Iâ€™ll come back with news,

NA
 Avdotya Romanovna said finally. And, of course, there was no going
beyond that, for this was a point which Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
afraid to discuss. Dounia went up and kissed her mother. The latter
warmly embraced her without speaking. Then she sat down to wait
anxiously for Razumihinâ€™s return, timidly watching her daughter who
walked up and down the room with her arms folded, lost in thought.
This walking up and down when she was thinking was a habit of Avdotya
Romanovnaâ€™s and the mother was always afraid to break in on her
daughterâ€™s mood at such moments.
Razumihin, of course, was ridiculous in his sudden drunken infatuation
for Avdotya Romanovna. Yet apart from his eccentric condition, many
people would have thought it justified if they had seen Avdotya
Romanovna, especially at that moment when she was walking to and
fro with folded arms, pensive and melancholy. Avdotya Romanovna was
remarkably good-looking; she was tall, strikingly well-proportioned,
strong and self-reliant--the latter quality was apparent in every
gesture, though it did not in the least detract from the grace and
softness of her movements. In face she resembled her brother, but she
might be described as really beautiful. Her hair was dark brown, a
little lighter than her brotherâ€™s; there was a proud light in her almost
black eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness. She was
pale, but it was a healthy pallor; her face was radiant with freshness
and vigour. Her mouth was rather small; the full red lower lip projected
a little as did her chin; it was the only irregularity in her beautiful
face, but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughty
expression. Her face was always more serious and thoughtful than gay;
but how well smiles, how well youthful, lighthearted, irresponsible,
laughter suited her face! It was natural enough that a warm, open,
simple-hearted, honest giant like Razumihin, who had never seen anyone
like her and was not quite sober at the time, should lose his head
immediately. Besides, as chance would have it, he saw Dounia for the
first time transfigured by her love for her brother and her joy at
meeting him. Afterwards he saw her lower lip quiver with indignation
at her brotherâ€™s insolent, cruel and ungrateful words--and his fate was
sealed.
He had spoken the truth, moreover, when he blurted out in his drunken
talk on the stairs that Praskovya Pavlovna, Raskolnikovâ€™s eccentric
landlady, would be jealous of Pulcheria Alexandrovna as well as of
Avdotya Romanovna on his account. Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
forty-three, her face still retained traces of her former beauty; she
looked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost always the
case with women who retain serenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pure
sincere warmth of heart to old age. We may add in parenthesis that to
preserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty to old age. Her
hair had begun to grow grey and thin, there had long been little crowâ€™s
foot wrinkles round her eyes, her cheeks were hollow and sunken from
anxiety and grief, and yet it was a handsome face. She was Dounia
over again, twenty years older, but without the projecting underlip.
Pulcheria Alexandrovna was emotional, but not sentimental, timid and
yielding, but only to a certain point. She could give way and accept a
great deal even of what was contrary to her convictions, but there was a
certain barrier fixed by honesty, principle and the deepest convictions
which nothing would induce her to cross.
Exactly twenty minutes after Razumihinâ€™s departure, there came two
subdued but hurried knocks at the door: he had come back.
NA
opened. â€œHe sleeps like a top, soundly, quietly, and God grant he may
sleep ten hours. Nastasyaâ€™s with him; I told her not to leave till I

warmth, resuming her walk up and down the room.
It was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps in the corridor
and another knock at the door. Both women waited this time completely
relying on Razumihinâ€™s promise; he actually had succeeded in bringing
Zossimov. Zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party to
go to Raskolnikovâ€™s, but he came reluctantly and with the greatest
suspicion to see the ladies, mistrusting Razumihin in his exhilarated
condition. But his vanity was at once reassured and flattered; he saw
that they were really expecting him as an oracle. He stayed just ten
minutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting Pulcheria
Alexandrovna. He spoke with marked sympathy, but with the reserve and
extreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation.
He did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display the
slightest desire to enter into more personal relations with the two
ladies. Remarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of Avdotya
Romanovna, he endeavoured not to notice her at all during his visit and
addressed himself solely to Pulcheria Alexandrovna. All this gave him
extraordinary inward satisfaction. He declared that he thought the
invalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily. According to his
observations the patientâ€™s illness was due partly to his unfortunate
material surroundings during the last few months, but it had partly also
a moral origin, â€œwas, so to speak, the product of several material and
moral influences, anxieties, apprehensions, troubles, certain ideas...
NA
words with close attention, Zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this
theme. On Pulcheria Alexandrovnaâ€™s anxiously and timidly inquiring as

smile that his words had been exaggerated; that certainly the patient
had some fixed idea, something approaching a monomania--he, Zossimov,
was now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine--but
that it must be recollected that until to-day the patient had been in
delirium and... and that no doubt the presence of his family would have
a favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind, â€œif only all
NA
took leave with an impressive and affable bow, while blessings, warm
gratitude, and entreaties were showered upon him, and Avdotya Romanovna
spontaneously offered her hand to him. He went out exceedingly pleased
with his visit and still more so with himself.

had let him go, he stared at him and went off into a sudden guffaw.
Razumihin stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection.

They walked along in silence and only when they were close to
Raskolnikovâ€™s lodgings, Razumihin broke the silence in considerable
anxiety.

failings, youâ€™re a loose fish, that I know, and a dirty one, too. You
are a feeble, nervous wretch, and a mass of whims, youâ€™re getting fat
and lazy and canâ€™t deny yourself anything--and I call that dirty because
it leads one straight into the dirt. Youâ€™ve let yourself get so slack
that I donâ€™t know how it is you are still a good, even a devoted doctor.
You--a doctor--sleep on a feather bed and get up at night to your
patients! In another three or four years you wonâ€™t get up for your
patients... But hang it all, thatâ€™s not the point!... You are going
to spend to-night in the landladyâ€™s flat here. (Hard work Iâ€™ve had to
persuade her!) And Iâ€™ll be in the kitchen. So hereâ€™s a chance for you to
get to know her better.... Itâ€™s not as you think! Thereâ€™s not a trace of

Zossimov laughed more violently than ever.
NA
â€œIt wonâ€™t be much trouble, I assure you. Talk any rot you like to her,
as long as you sit by her and talk. Youâ€™re a doctor, too; try curing
her of something. I swear you wonâ€™t regret it. She has a piano, and you
know, I strum a little. I have a song there, a genuine Russian one: â€˜I
shed hot tears.â€™ She likes the genuine article--and well, it all
began with that song; Now youâ€™re a regular performer, a _maÃ®tre_, a

â€œWell, I canâ€™t, thatâ€™s all about it! Thereâ€™s an element of attraction

â€œI havenâ€™t fascinated her; perhaps I was fascinated myself in my folly.
But she wonâ€™t care a straw whether itâ€™s you or I, so long as somebody
sits beside her, sighing.... I canâ€™t explain the position, brother...
look here, you are good at mathematics, and working at it now... begin
teaching her the integral calculus; upon my soul, Iâ€™m not joking, Iâ€™m
in earnest, itâ€™ll be just the same to her. She will gaze at you and sigh
for a whole year together. I talked to her once for two days at a time
about the Prussian House of Lords (for one must talk of something)--she
just sighed and perspired! And you mustnâ€™t talk of love--sheâ€™s bashful
to hysterics--but just let her see you canâ€™t tear yourself away--thatâ€™s
enough. Itâ€™s fearfully comfortable; youâ€™re quite at home, you can
read, sit, lie about, write. You may even venture on a kiss, if youâ€™re

â€œAch, I canâ€™t make you understand! You see, you are made for each other!
I have often been reminded of you!... Youâ€™ll come to it in the end! So
does it matter whether itâ€™s sooner or later? Thereâ€™s the feather-bed
element here, brother--ach! and not only that! Thereâ€™s an attraction
here--here you have the end of the world, an anchorage, a quiet haven,
the navel of the earth, the three fishes that are the foundation of the
world, the essence of pancakes, of savoury fish-pies, of the evening
samovar, of soft sighs and warm shawls, and hot stoves to sleep on--as
snug as though you were dead, and yet youâ€™re alive--the advantages
of both at once! Well, hang it, brother, what stuff Iâ€™m talking, itâ€™s
bedtime! Listen. I sometimes wake up at night; so Iâ€™ll go in and look at
him. But thereâ€™s no need, itâ€™s all right. Donâ€™t you worry yourself,

CHAPTER II
Razumihin waked up next morning at eight oâ€™clock, troubled and serious.
He found himself confronted with many new and unlooked-for perplexities.
He had never expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that. He
remembered every detail of the previous day and he knew that a perfectly
novel experience had befallen him, that he had received an impression
unlike anything he had known before. At the same time he recognised
clearly that the dream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly
unattainable--so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it, and
he hastened to pass to the other more practical cares and difficulties
NA
The most awful recollection of the previous day was the way he had shown
NA
because he had taken advantage of the young girlâ€™s position to abuse
her _fiancÃ©_ in his stupid jealousy, knowing nothing of their mutual
relations and obligations and next to nothing of the man himself. And
what right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner?
Who had asked for his opinion? Was it thinkable that such a creature as
Avdotya Romanovna would be marrying an unworthy man for money? So there
must be something in him. The lodgings? But after all how could he know
the character of the lodgings? He was furnishing a flat... Foo! how
despicable it all was! And what justification was it that he was drunk?
Such a stupid excuse was even more degrading! In wine is truth, and the
truth had all come out, â€œthat is, all the uncleanness of his coarse
NA
him, Razumihin? What was he beside such a girl--he, the drunken noisy
braggart of last night? Was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical
a juxtaposition? Razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea and
suddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he had
said last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of
Avdotya Romanovna... that was simply intolerable. He brought his fist
down heavily on the kitchen stove, hurt his hand and sent one of the
bricks flying.
NA
self-abasement, â€œof course, all these infamies can never be wiped out or
smoothed over... and so itâ€™s useless even to think of it, and I must
go to them in silence and do my duty... in silence, too... and not ask

And yet as he dressed he examined his attire more carefully than usual.
He hadnâ€™t another suit--if he had had, perhaps he wouldnâ€™t have put it
NA
could not remain a cynic and a dirty sloven; he had no right to offend
the feelings of others, especially when they were in need of his
assistance and asking him to see them. He brushed his clothes carefully.
His linen was always decent; in that respect he was especially clean.
He washed that morning scrupulously--he got some soap from Nastasya--he
washed his hair, his neck and especially his hands. When it came to the
question whether to shave his stubbly chin or not (Praskovya Pavlovna
had capital razors that had been left by her late husband), the question
was angrily answered in the negative. â€œLet it stay as it is! What if
they think that I shaved on purpose to...? They certainly would think
NA
â€œAnd... the worst of it was he was so coarse, so dirty, he had the
manners of a pothouse; and... and even admitting that he knew he had
some of the essentials of a gentleman... what was there in that to be
proud of? Everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that... and all
the same (he remembered) he, too, had done little things... not exactly
dishonest, and yet.... And what thoughts he sometimes had; hm... and to
set all that beside Avdotya Romanovna! Confound it! So be it! Well, heâ€™d
make a point then of being dirty, greasy, pothouse in his manners and he

He was engaged in such monologues when Zossimov, who had spent the night
in Praskovya Pavlovnaâ€™s parlour, came in.
He was going home and was in a hurry to look at the invalid first.
Razumihin informed him that Raskolnikov was sleeping like a dormouse.
Zossimov gave orders that they shouldnâ€™t wake him and promised to see
him again about eleven.

NA
â€œBut I am not a father confessor; I shall come and go away; Iâ€™ve plenty
NA
NA
I talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him... all sorts of things... and
NA
NA
â€œI know it was stupid! You may beat me if you like! Did you think so
NA
â€œThatâ€™s nonsense, I tell you, how could I think it seriously? You,
yourself, described him as a monomaniac when you fetched me to
him... and we added fuel to the fire yesterday, you did, that is, with
your story about the painter; it was a nice conversation, when he was,
perhaps, mad on that very point! If only Iâ€™d known what happened then
at the police station and that some wretch... had insulted him with this
suspicion! Hm... I would not have allowed that conversation yesterday.
These monomaniacs will make a mountain out of a mole-hill... and
see their fancies as solid realities.... As far as I remember, it was
Zametovâ€™s story that cleared up half the mystery, to my mind. Why, I
know one case in which a hypochondriac, a man of forty, cut the throat
of a little boy of eight, because he couldnâ€™t endure the jokes he made
every day at table! And in this case his rags, the insolent police
officer, the fever and this suspicion! All that working upon a man half
frantic with hypochondria, and with his morbid exceptional vanity! That
may well have been the starting-point of illness. Well, bother it
all!... And, by the way, that Zametov certainly is a nice fellow, but
hm... he shouldnâ€™t have told all that last night. He is an awful

NA
NA
NA
â€œAnd, by the way, have you any influence on them, his mother and sister?
NA
NA
â€œWhy is he so set against this Luzhin? A man with money and she doesnâ€™t

NA
can I tell whether theyâ€™ve a farthing? Ask them yourself and perhaps
NA
â€œFoo! what an ass you are sometimes! Last nightâ€™s wine has not gone off
yet.... Good-bye; thank your Praskovya Pavlovna from me for my nightâ€™s
lodging. She locked herself in, made no reply to my _bonjour_ through
the door; she was up at seven oâ€™clock, the samovar was taken into her
NA
At nine oâ€™clock precisely Razumihin reached the lodgings at Bakaleyevâ€™s
house. Both ladies were waiting for him with nervous impatience. They
had risen at seven oâ€™clock or earlier. He entered looking as black as
night, bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it. He
had reckoned without his host: Pulcheria Alexandrovna fairly rushed at
him, seized him by both hands and was almost kissing them. He glanced
timidly at Avdotya Romanovna, but her proud countenance wore at that
moment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness, such
complete and unlooked-for respect (in place of the sneering looks and
ill-disguised contempt he had expected), that it threw him into greater
confusion than if he had been met with abuse. Fortunately there was a
subject for conversation, and he made haste to snatch at it.
Hearing that everything was going well and that Rodya had not yet waked,
Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared that she was glad to hear it, because
â€œshe had something which it was very, very necessary to talk over
NA
to have it with them; they had waited to have it with him. Avdotya
Romanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter, and
they asked him to bring tea which was served at last, but in such
a dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed. Razumihin
vigorously attacked the lodgings, but, remembering Luzhin, stopped
in embarrassment and was greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovnaâ€™s
questions, which showered in a continual stream upon him.
He talked for three quarters of an hour, being constantly interrupted
by their questions, and succeeded in describing to them all the
most important facts he knew of the last year of Raskolnikovâ€™s life,
concluding with a circumstantial account of his illness. He omitted,
however, many things, which were better omitted, including the scene at
the police station with all its consequences. They listened eagerly
to his story, and, when he thought he had finished and satisfied his
listeners, he found that they considered he had hardly begun.
â€œTell me, tell me! What do you think...? Excuse me, I still donâ€™t know
NA
NA
â€œI should like very, very much to know, Dmitri Prokofitch... how he
looks... on things in general now, that is, how can I explain, what are
his likes and dislikes? Is he always so irritable? Tell me, if you can,
what are his hopes and, so to say, his dreams? Under what influences is
NA
NA
â€œGood heavens, I had not expected to find him in the least like this,
NA
NA
every year and almost every time he can scarcely recognise me, even in
appearance, though he is a clever man; and your three yearsâ€™ separation
means a great deal. What am I to tell you? I have known Rodion for
a year and a half; he is morose, gloomy, proud and haughty, and of
late--and perhaps for a long time before--he has been suspicious and
fanciful. He has a noble nature and a kind heart. He does not like
showing his feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open his
heart freely. Sometimes, though, he is not at all morbid, but simply
cold and inhumanly callous; itâ€™s as though he were alternating between
two characters. Sometimes he is fearfully reserved! He says he is
so busy that everything is a hindrance, and yet he lies in bed doing
nothing. He doesnâ€™t jeer at things, not because he hasnâ€™t the wit, but
as though he hadnâ€™t time to waste on such trifles. He never listens
to what is said to him. He is never interested in what interests other
people at any given moment. He thinks very highly of himself and perhaps
he is right. Well, what more? I think your arrival will have a most
NA
NA
Razumihinâ€™s account of her Rodya.
And Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Avdotya Romanovna at last.
He glanced at her often while he was talking, but only for a moment and
looked away again at once. Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table, listening
attentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro with her
arms folded and her lips compressed, occasionally putting in a question,
without stopping her walk. She had the same habit of not listening to
what was said. She was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a
white transparent scarf round her neck. Razumihin soon detected signs of
extreme poverty in their belongings. Had Avdotya Romanovna been dressed
like a queen, he felt that he would not be afraid of her, but perhaps
just because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery
of her surroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began to be
afraid of every word he uttered, every gesture he made, which was very
trying for a man who already felt diffident.
â€œYouâ€™ve told us a great deal that is interesting about my brotherâ€™s
character... and have told it impartially. I am glad. I thought that you

NA
thoughtfully.
NA
NA
NA
decisively.
NA
â€œDo you know, Avdotya Romanovna, you are awfully like your brother, in
NA
remembering at once what he had just before said of her brother,
he turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion. Avdotya
Romanovna couldnâ€™t help laughing when she looked at him.
NA
slightly piqued. â€œI am not talking of our present difficulty, Dounia.
What Pyotr Petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and I have
supposed may be mistaken, but you canâ€™t imagine, Dmitri Prokofitch, how
moody and, so to say, capricious he is. I never could depend on what
he would do when he was only fifteen. And I am sure that he might
do something now that nobody else would think of doing... Well, for
instance, do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave
me a shock that nearly killed me, when he had the idea of marrying that
NA
NA
NA
suppose that my tears, my entreaties, my illness, my possible death from
grief, our poverty would have made him pause? No, he would calmly have
NA
NA
cautiously. â€œBut I did hear something from Praskovya Pavlovna herself,
though she is by no means a gossip. And what I heard certainly was
NA
NA
â€œWell, nothing very special. I only learned that the marriage, which
only failed to take place through the girlâ€™s death, was not at all to
Praskovya Pavlovnaâ€™s liking. They say, too, the girl was not at all
pretty, in fact I am told positively ugly... and such an invalid... and
queer. But she seems to have had some good qualities. She must have
had some good qualities or itâ€™s quite inexplicable.... She had no money
either and he wouldnâ€™t have considered her money.... But itâ€™s always
NA
NA
â€œGod forgive me, I simply rejoiced at her death. Though I donâ€™t know
which of them would have caused most misery to the other--he to her
NA
tentatively questioning him about the scene on the previous day with
Luzhin, hesitating and continually glancing at Dounia, obviously to
the latterâ€™s annoyance. This incident more than all the rest evidently
caused her uneasiness, even consternation. Razumihin described it in
detail again, but this time he added his own conclusions: he openly
blamed Raskolnikov for intentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch, not
seeking to excuse him on the score of his illness.
NA
NA
But she was very much surprised at hearing Razumihin express himself
so carefully and even with a certain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch.
Avdotya Romanovna, too, was struck by it.
NA
could not resist asking.
NA
 Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth, â€œand I donâ€™t say it simply
from vulgar politeness, but because... simply because Avdotya Romanovna
has of her own free will deigned to accept this man. If I spoke so
rudely of him last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and...
mad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely... and this
NA
He crimsoned and ceased speaking. Avdotya Romanovna flushed, but did not
break the silence. She had not uttered a word from the moment they began
to speak of Luzhin.
Without her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously did not know what
to do. At last, faltering and continually glancing at her daughter, she
confessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance.
NA
NA
NA
NA
speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind. â€œVery early this
morning we got a note from Pyotr Petrovitch in reply to our letter
announcing our arrival. He promised to meet us at the station, you
know; instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these
lodgings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he would
be here himself this morning. But this morning this note came from him.
Youâ€™d better read it yourself; there is one point in it which worries me
very much... you will soon see what that is, and... tell me your candid
opinion, Dmitri Prokofitch! You know Rodyaâ€™s character better than
anyone and no one can advise us better than you can. Dounia, I must tell
you, made her decision at once, but I still donâ€™t feel sure how to act
NA
Razumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and read
as follows:
â€œDear Madam, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I have the honour to inform you
that owing to unforeseen obstacles I was rendered unable to meet you at
the railway station; I sent a very competent person with the same object
in view. I likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with
you to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does not admit of
delay, and also that I may not intrude on your family circle while you
are meeting your son, and Avdotya Romanovna her brother. I shall have
the honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings
not later than to-morrow evening at eight oâ€™clock precisely, and
herewith I venture to present my earnest and, I may add, imperative
request that Rodion Romanovitch may not be present at our interview--as
he offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my
visit to him in his illness yesterday, and, moreover, since I desire
from you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation
upon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to learn your own
interpretation. I have the honour to inform you, in anticipation,
that if, in spite of my request, I meet Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be
compelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to
blame. I write on the assumption that Rodion Romanovitch who appeared so
ill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, being able
to leave the house, may visit you also. I was confirmed in that belief
by the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who
was run over and has since died, to whose daughter, a young woman of
notorious behaviour, he gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext of the
funeral, which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at to
raise that sum. Herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable
daughter, Avdotya Romanovna, I beg you to accept the respectful homage
of
â€œYour humble servant,

NA
almost weeping. â€œHow can I ask Rodya not to come? Yesterday he insisted
so earnestly on our refusing Pyotr Petrovitch and now we are ordered not
to receive Rodya! He will come on purpose if he knows, and... what will
NA
NA
once.
â€œOh, dear me! She says... goodness knows what she says, she doesnâ€™t
explain her object! She says that it would be best, at least, not that
it would be best, but that itâ€™s absolutely necessary that Rodya should
make a point of being here at eight oâ€™clock and that they must meet....
I didnâ€™t want even to show him the letter, but to prevent him
from coming by some stratagem with your help... because he is so
irritable.... Besides I donâ€™t understand about that drunkard who died
and that daughter, and how he could have given the daughter all the

NA
NA

was sense in it too.... Hm! He did say something, as we were going home
yesterday evening, about a dead man and a girl, but I didnâ€™t understand

there I assure you we shall see at once whatâ€™s to be done. Besides,

While she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle;
Dounia, too, put on her things. Her gloves, as Razumihin noticed, were
not merely shabby but had holes in them, and yet this evident poverty
gave the two ladies an air of special dignity, which is always found in
people who know how to wear poor clothes. Razumihin looked reverently
at Dounia and felt proud of escorting her. â€œThe queen who mended her
NA
NA
NA
should ever fear seeing my son, my darling, darling Rodya! I am afraid,
NA
NA
NA
NA
 exclaimed the poor woman.
They came out into the street.
â€œDo you know, Dounia, when I dozed a little this morning I dreamed of
Marfa Petrovna... she was all in white... she came up to me, took
my hand, and shook her head at me, but so sternly as though she were
blaming me.... Is that a good omen? Oh, dear me! You donâ€™t know, Dmitri
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAh, you donâ€™t know? And I was thinking that you knew all about us.
Forgive me, Dmitri Prokofitch, I donâ€™t know what I am thinking about
these last few days. I look upon you really as a providence for us, and
so I took it for granted that you knew all about us. I look on you as a
relation.... Donâ€™t be angry with me for saying so. Dear me, whatâ€™s the
NA
NA
â€œI sometimes speak too much from the heart, so that Dounia finds fault
with me.... But, dear me, what a cupboard he lives in! I wonder whether
he is awake? Does this woman, his landlady, consider it a room? Listen,
you say he does not like to show his feelings, so perhaps I shall annoy
him with my... weaknesses? Do advise me, Dmitri Prokofitch, how am I to

â€œDonâ€™t question him too much about anything if you see him frown; donâ€™t

â€œAh, Dmitri Prokofitch, how hard it is to be a mother! But here are the

NA
The ladies slowly followed Razumihin, who went on before, and when they
reached the landladyâ€™s door on the fourth storey, they noticed that her
door was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watching
them from the darkness within. When their eyes met, the door was
suddenly shut with such a slam that Pulcheria Alexandrovna almost cried
out.
CHAPTER III
NA
He had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place
as before, on the sofa. Raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner,
fully dressed and carefully washed and combed, as he had not been for
some time past. The room was immediately crowded, yet Nastasya managed
to follow the visitors in and stayed to listen.
Raskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with his condition the
day before, but he was still pale, listless, and sombre. He looked like
a wounded man or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering.
His brows were knitted, his lips compressed, his eyes feverish. He spoke
little and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, and there was a
restlessness in his movements.
He only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete
the impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm. The
pale, sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sister
entered, but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering, in
place of its listless dejection. The light soon died away, but the look
of suffering remained, and Zossimov, watching and studying his patient
with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise, noticed
in him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister, but a sort of
bitter, hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable
torture. He saw later that almost every word of the following
conversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it. But
at the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself
and hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous day had, like a
monomaniac, fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word.
NA
giving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made Pulcheria
Alexandrovna radiant at once. â€œAnd I donâ€™t say this _as I did
NA
his hand.
NA
delighted at the ladiesâ€™ entrance, for he had not succeeded in keeping
up a conversation with his patient for ten minutes. â€œIn another three or
four days, if he goes on like this, he will be just as before, that is,
as he was a month ago, or two... or perhaps even three. This has been
coming on for a long while.... eh? Confess, now, that it has been
NA
still afraid of irritating him.
NA
NA
recovery depends solely on yourself. Now that one can talk to you,
I should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the
elementary, so to speak, fundamental causes tending to produce your
morbid condition: in that case you will be cured, if not, it will go
from bad to worse. These fundamental causes I donâ€™t know, but they must
be known to you. You are an intelligent man, and must have observed
yourself, of course. I fancy the first stage of your derangement
coincides with your leaving the university. You must not be left without
occupation, and so, work and a definite aim set before you might, I
NA
â€œYes, yes; you are perfectly right.... I will make haste and return to
NA
Zossimov, who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect before
the ladies, was certainly somewhat mystified, when, glancing at his
patient, he observed unmistakable mockery on his face. This lasted
an instant, however. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began at once thanking
Zossimov, especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night.
NA
NA
â€œAch, Rodya, that was only till two oâ€™clock. Dounia and I never go to
NA
NA
suddenly frowning and looking down. â€œSetting aside the question of
payment--forgive me for referring to it (he turned to Zossimov)--I
really donâ€™t know what I have done to deserve such special attention
from you! I simply donâ€™t understand it... and... and... it weighs upon

NA
are my first patient--well--we fellows just beginning to practise love
our first patients as if they were our children, and some almost fall in
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhat nonsense he is talking! Why, you are in a sentimental mood to-day,
NA
If he had had more penetration he would have seen that there was no
trace of sentimentality in him, but something indeed quite the opposite.
But Avdotya Romanovna noticed it. She was intently and uneasily watching
her brother.
NA
repeating a lesson learned by heart. â€œIt is only to-day that I have
been able to realise a little how distressed you must have been here
NA
When he had said this, he suddenly held out his hand to his sister,
smiling without a word. But in this smile there was a flash of real
unfeigned feeling. Dounia caught it at once, and warmly pressed his
hand, overjoyed and thankful. It was the first time he had addressed her
since their dispute the previous day. The motherâ€™s face lighted up
with ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken
NA
exaggerating it all, muttered to himself, with a vigorous turn in his
NA
NA
generous impulses he has, and how simply, how delicately he put an end
to all the misunderstanding with his sister--simply by holding out his
hand at the right minute and looking at her like that.... And what
fine eyes he has, and how fine his whole face is!... He is even better
looking than Dounia.... But, good heavens, what a suit--how terribly
heâ€™s dressed!... Vasya, the messenger boy in Afanasy Ivanitchâ€™s shop, is
better dressed! I could rush at him and hug him... weep over him--but
I am afraid.... Oh, dear, heâ€™s so strange! Heâ€™s talking kindly, but Iâ€™m
NA
NA
answer his words to her, â€œhow unhappy Dounia and I were yesterday! Now
that itâ€™s all over and done with and we are quite happy again--I can
tell you. Fancy, we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace
you and that woman--ah, here she is! Good morning, Nastasya!... She told
us at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away
from the doctor in delirium, and they were looking for you in the
streets. You canâ€™t imagine how we felt! I couldnâ€™t help thinking of the
tragic end of Lieutenant Potanchikov, a friend of your fatherâ€™s--you
canâ€™t remember him, Rodya--who ran out in the same way in a high fever
and fell into the well in the court-yard and they couldnâ€™t pull him out
till next day. Of course, we exaggerated things. We were on the point of
rushing to find Pyotr Petrovitch to ask him to help.... Because we were
NA
suddenly, recollecting it was still somewhat dangerous to speak of Pyotr

at him in perplexity.
NA
yes; mother, and you too, Dounia, please donâ€™t think that I didnâ€™t mean

NA

NA
and asking forgiveness as though he were performing a rite or repeating
NA
â€œIâ€™ve only just waked up, and wanted to go to you, but was delayed owing
to my clothes; I forgot yesterday to ask her... Nastasya... to wash out
NA
NA
â€œOh, nothing--donâ€™t be uneasy. It was when I was wandering about
yesterday, rather delirious, I chanced upon a man who had been run

actions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions--itâ€™s

â€œPerhaps itâ€™s a good thing really that he should think me almost a

Dounia, looking uneasily at Zossimov.
NA
sense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen, but with the
slight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder, for we
must draw a line. A normal man, it is true, hardly exists. Among

NA
his favourite subject, everyone frowned.
Raskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention, plunged in thought with a
strange smile on his pale lips. He was still meditating on something.

 Razumihin cried hastily.
NA
blood helping to carry him to his lodging. By the way, mamma, I did an
unpardonable thing yesterday. I was literally out of my mind. I gave
away all the money you sent me... to his wife for the funeral. Sheâ€™s
a widow now, in consumption, a poor creature... three little children,
starving... nothing in the house... thereâ€™s a daughter, too... perhaps
youâ€™d have given it yourself if youâ€™d seen them. But I had no right to
do it I admit, especially as I knew how you needed the money yourself.
To help others one must have the right to do it, or else _Crevez,

hatred, and smiling sarcastically. â€œI ought to have considered that....
Well, thatâ€™s praiseworthy, and itâ€™s better for you... and if you reach a
line you wonâ€™t overstep, you will be unhappy... and if you overstep it,
NA
irritably, vexed at being carried away. â€œI only meant to say that I beg

NA
 said his mother, delighted.
NA
A silence followed. There was a certain constraint in all this
conversation, and in the silence, and in the reconciliation, and in the
forgiveness, and all were feeling it.
NA
to himself, looking askance at his mother and sister. Pulcheria
Alexandrovna was indeed growing more timid the longer she kept silent.
NA
his mind.
NA
suddenly blurted out.
NA
â€œOh, mercy on us--Marfa Petrovna SvidrigaÃ¯lov. I wrote you so much about
NA
NA
NA
NA
hurriedly, encouraged by his curiosity. â€œOn the very day I was sending
you that letter! Would you believe it, that awful man seems to have been
NA
NA
â€œNot at all. Quite the contrary indeed. With her, he was always very
patient, considerate even. In fact, all those seven years of their
married life he gave way to her, too much so indeed, in many cases. All
NA
â€œThen he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven

NA
answered, almost with a shudder, knitting her brows, and sinking into
thought.
NA
hurriedly. â€œAnd directly afterwards she ordered the horses to be
harnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner. She always used
to drive to the town in such cases. She ate a very good dinner, I am
NA
NA
â€œThat was always her... habit; and immediately after dinner, so as not
to be late in starting, she went to the bath-house.... You see, she was
undergoing some treatment with baths. They have a cold spring there, and
she used to bathe in it regularly every day, and no sooner had she got

her brother. â€œMother was crossing herself with terror as she came up the

His face worked, as though in convulsion.
â€œAch, what are you saying, Dounia! Donâ€™t be angry, please, Rodya....
NA
overwhelmed--â€œYou see, coming here, I was dreaming all the way, in the
train, how we should meet, how we should talk over everything
together.... And I was so happy, I did not notice the journey! But what
am I saying? I am happy now.... You should not, Dounia.... I am happy
NA
NA
NA
As he said this, he was suddenly overwhelmed with confusion and turned
pale. Again that awful sensation he had known of late passed with deadly
chill over his soul. Again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to
him that he had just told a fearful lie--that he would never now be
able to speak freely of everything--that he would never again be able to
_speak_ of anything to anyone. The anguish of this thought was such that
for a moment he almost forgot himself. He got up from his seat, and not
looking at anyone walked towards the door.
NA
He sat down again, and began looking about him, in silence. They were
all looking at him in perplexity.
NA
unexpectedly. â€œDo say something! Whatâ€™s the use of sitting like this?
Come, do speak. Let us talk.... We meet together and sit in silence....
NA
â€œThank God; I was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning
NA
NA
NA
laughed.
â€œWell, if you remembered something; thatâ€™s all right!... I was beginning
NA
NA
his bows, and went out.
NA
NA
began, suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity, and a liveliness he
had not shown till then. â€œI canâ€™t remember where I met him before my
illness.... I believe I have met him somewhere----... And this is a good

her; and suddenly, for some unknown reason, laughed.
NA
NA
confusion, and he got up from his chair. Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiled
faintly, but Raskolnikov laughed aloud.
NA
NA
â€œYou need not at all. Stay. Zossimov has gone, so you must. Donâ€™t go.
Whatâ€™s the time? Is it twelve oâ€™clock? What a pretty watch you have got,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
unreasonably delighted.
NA
NA
â€œA-ah! And do you remember, mother, I was in love and wanted to get
NA
by the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it.
NA
Pulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glances with Dounia and Razumihin.
â€œHâ€™m, yes. What shall I tell you? I donâ€™t remember much indeed. She was
NA
â€œQuite an invalid. She was fond of giving alms to the poor, and was
always dreaming of a nunnery, and once she burst into tears when she
began talking to me about it. Yes, yes, I remember. I remember very
well. She was an ugly little thing. I really donâ€™t know what drew me
to her then--I think it was because she was always ill. If she had been

NA
NA
He fixed a strained intent look on his sister, but did not hear or did
not understand her words. Then, completely lost in thought, he got up,
went up to his mother, kissed her, went back to his place and sat down.
NA
â€œHer? Now? Oh, yes.... You ask about her? No... thatâ€™s all now, as
it were, in another world... and so long ago. And indeed everything
NA
â€œYou, now... I seem to be looking at you from a thousand miles away...
but, goodness knows why we are talking of that! And whatâ€™s the use of
NA
into dreamy silence again.
NA
Pulcheria Alexandrovna, suddenly breaking the oppressive silence. â€œI
am sure itâ€™s quite half through your lodging you have become so
NA
NA
deal to do with it.... I thought that, too.... If only you knew, though,
NA
strangely.
A little more, and their companionship, this mother and this sister,
with him after three yearsâ€™ absence, this intimate tone of conversation,
in face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything,
would have been beyond his power of endurance. But there was one urgent
matter which must be settled one way or the other that day--so he had
decided when he woke. Now he was glad to remember it, as a means of
escape.
NA
pardon for yesterday, but I consider it my duty to tell you again that
I do not withdraw from my chief point. It is me or Luzhin. If I am a
scoundrel, you must not be. One is enough. If you marry Luzhin, I cease
NA
NA
Alexandrovna cried, mournfully. â€œAnd why do you call yourself a
NA
NA
this there is a mistake on your part. I thought it over at night,
and found out the mistake. It is all because you seem to fancy I am
sacrificing myself to someone and for someone. That is not the case at
all. I am simply marrying for my own sake, because things are hard for
me. Though, of course, I shall be glad if I succeed in being useful to
NA
NA
â€œProud creature! She wonâ€™t admit she wants to do it out of charity! Too
haughty! Oh, base characters! They even love as though they hate.... Oh,
NA
NA
two evils I choose the less. I intend to do honestly all he expects of
NA
flushed, and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes.
NA
â€œWithin certain limits. Both the manner and form of Pyotr Petrovitchâ€™s
courtship showed me at once what he wanted. He may, of course, think too
well of himself, but I hope he esteems me, too.... Why are you laughing
NA
â€œAnd why are you blushing again? You are lying, sister. You are
intentionally lying, simply from feminine obstinacy, simply to hold your
own against me.... You cannot respect Luzhin. I have seen him and talked
with him. So you are selling yourself for money, and so in any case you
NA
NA
â€œI would not marry him if I were not convinced that he esteems me
and thinks highly of me. I would not marry him if I were not firmly
convinced that I can respect him. Fortunately, I can have convincing
proof of it this very day... and such a marriage is not a vileness, as
you say! And even if you were right, if I really had determined on a
vile action, is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like that?
Why do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either? It
is despotism; it is tyranny. If I ruin anyone, it is only myself.... I
am not committing a murder. Why do you look at me like that? Why are you
NA
NA
â€œNo, no, nonsense! Itâ€™s nothing. A little giddiness--not fainting. You
have fainting on the brain. Hâ€™m, yes, what was I saying? Oh, yes. In
what way will you get convincing proof to-day that you can respect him,
NA
NA
With trembling hands, Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave him the letter. He
took it with great interest, but, before opening it, he suddenly looked
with a sort of wonder at Dounia.
NA
NA
He said this as though to himself, but said it aloud, and looked for
some time at his sister, as though puzzled. He opened the letter at
last, still with the same look of strange wonder on his face. Then,
slowly and attentively, he began reading, and read it through twice.
Pulcheria Alexandrovna showed marked anxiety, and all indeed expected
something particular.
NA
to his mother, but not addressing anyone in particular, â€œis that he is a
business man, a lawyer, and his conversation is pretentious indeed, and
NA
They all started. They had expected something quite different.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Alexandrovna began, embarrassed.
NA
NA
â€œLegal? Yes, itâ€™s just legal--business language--not so very uneducated,
NA
â€œPyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap
NA
Romanovna observed, somewhat offended by her brotherâ€™s tone.
â€œWell, if heâ€™s proud of it, he has reason, I donâ€™t deny it. You seem to
be offended, sister, at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the
letter, and to think that I speak of such trifling matters on purpose to
annoy you. It is quite the contrary, an observation apropos of the style
occurred to me that is by no means irrelevant as things stand. There
is one expression, â€˜blame yourselvesâ€™ put in very significantly and
plainly, and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if I
am present. That threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon
you both if you are disobedient, and to abandon you now after summoning
you to Petersburg. Well, what do you think? Can one resent such an
expression from Luzhin, as we should if he (he pointed to Razumihin) had
NA
NA
was too naÃ¯vely expressed, and that perhaps he simply has no skill
in writing... that is a true criticism, brother. I did not expect,
NA
â€œIt is expressed in legal style, and sounds coarser than perhaps he
intended. But I must disillusion you a little. There is one expression
in the letter, one slander about me, and rather a contemptible one. I
gave the money last night to the widow, a woman in consumption, crushed
with trouble, and not â€˜on the pretext of the funeral,â€™ but simply to pay
for the funeral, and not to the daughter--a young woman, as he writes,
of notorious behaviour (whom I saw last night for the first time in my
life)--but to the widow. In all this I see a too hasty desire to slander
me and to raise dissension between us. It is expressed again in legal
jargon, that is to say, with a too obvious display of the aim, and
with a very naÃ¯ve eagerness. He is a man of intelligence, but to act
sensibly, intelligence is not enough. It all shows the man and... I
donâ€™t think he has a great esteem for you. I tell you this simply to
NA
Dounia did not reply. Her resolution had been taken. She was only
awaiting the evening.
NA
was more uneasy than ever at the sudden, new businesslike tone of his
talk.
NA
â€œYou see Pyotr Petrovitch writes that you are not to be with us this
NA
â€œThat, of course, is not for me to decide, but for you first, if you are
not offended by such a request; and secondly, by Dounia, if she, too, is

NA
Alexandrovna hastened to declare.
â€œI decided to ask you, Rodya, to urge you not to fail to be with us at

concealment and deception. Better let us have the whole truth.... Pyotr

CHAPTER IV
At that moment the door was softly opened, and a young girl walked into
the room, looking timidly about her. Everyone turned towards her with
surprise and curiosity. At first sight, Raskolnikov did not recognise
her. It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov. He had seen her yesterday for
the first time, but at such a moment, in such surroundings and in such
a dress, that his memory retained a very different image of her. Now she
was a modestly and poorly-dressed young girl, very young, indeed,
almost like a child, with a modest and refined manner, with a candid but
somewhat frightened-looking face. She was wearing a very plain indoor
dress, and had on a shabby old-fashioned hat, but she still carried a
parasol. Unexpectedly finding the room full of people, she was not so
much embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness, like a
NA
Raskolnikov, extremely astonished, and he, too, was confused. He at once
recollected that his mother and sister knew through Luzhinâ€™s letter
NA
protesting against Luzhinâ€™s calumny and declaring that he had seen the
girl last night for the first time, and suddenly she had walked in. He
remembered, too, that he had not protested against the expression â€œof
NA
his brain, but looking at her more intently, he saw that the humiliated
creature was so humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her. When she
made a movement to retreat in terror, it sent a pang to his heart.
NA
stop. â€œPlease sit down. You come, no doubt, from Katerina Ivanovna.
NA
At Soniaâ€™s entrance, Razumihin, who had been sitting on one of
Raskolnikovâ€™s three chairs, close to the door, got up to allow her to
enter. Raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where
Zossimov had been sitting, but feeling that the sofa which served him
as a bed, was too _familiar_ a place, he hurriedly motioned her to
Razumihinâ€™s chair.
NA
Sonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and looked timidly at the
two ladies. It was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she
could sit down beside them. At the thought of it, she was so frightened
that she hurriedly got up again, and in utter confusion addressed
Raskolnikov.
NA
began falteringly. â€œI come from Katerina Ivanovna, and she had no one to
send. Katerina Ivanovna told me to beg you... to be at the service... in
the morning... at Mitrofanievsky... and then... to us... to her...
NA
ceased speaking.
NA
too, stood up, and he, too, faltered and could not finish his sentence.
NA
NA
he drew up a chair for her.
Sonia sat down again, and again timidly she took a hurried, frightened
look at the two ladies, and dropped her eyes. Raskolnikovâ€™s pale face
flushed, a shudder passed over him, his eyes glowed.
NA
Marmeladov, the daughter of that unfortunate Mr. Marmeladov, who was run
NA
Pulcheria Alexandrovna glanced at Sonia, and slightly screwed up
her eyes. In spite of her embarrassment before Rodyaâ€™s urgent and
challenging look, she could not deny herself that satisfaction. Dounia
gazed gravely and intently into the poor girlâ€™s face, and scrutinised
her with perplexity. Sonia, hearing herself introduced, tried to raise
her eyes again, but was more embarrassed than ever.
NA
NA
â€œNo, that was all right... it was too evident, the cause of death...
NA
NA
â€œAt the bodyâ€™s remaining so long. You see it is hot now. So that,
to-day, they will carry it to the cemetery, into the chapel, until
to-morrow. At first Katerina Ivanovna was unwilling, but now she sees
NA
NA
â€œShe begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to-morrow for the
NA
NA
â€œYes... just a little.... She told me to thank you very much for helping
NA
All at once her lips and chin began trembling, but, with an effort, she
controlled herself, looking down again.
During the conversation, Raskolnikov watched her carefully. She had a
thin, very thin, pale little face, rather irregular and angular, with a
sharp little nose and chin. She could not have been called pretty, but
her blue eyes were so clear, and when they lighted up, there was such
a kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help
being attracted. Her face, and her whole figure indeed, had another
peculiar characteristic. In spite of her eighteen years, she looked
almost a little girl--almost a child. And in some of her gestures, this
childishness seemed almost absurd.
â€œBut has Katerina Ivanovna been able to manage with such small means?
NA
persistently keeping up the conversation.
â€œThe coffin will be plain, of course... and everything will be plain, so

loud rapid whisper; and again she looked down in confusion. Her lips
and chin were trembling once more. She had been struck at once
by Raskolnikovâ€™s poor surroundings, and now these words broke out
spontaneously. A silence followed. There was a light in Douniaâ€™s eyes,
and even Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia.

â€œOh, no, no. And will you, Dmitri Prokofitch, do us the favour of dining
NA
NA
Razumihin bowed, positively radiant. For one moment, they were all
strangely embarrassed.
â€œGood-bye, Rodya, that is till we meet. I do not like saying good-bye.
NA
Pulcheria Alexandrovna meant to greet Sonia, too; but it somehow failed
to come off, and she went in a flutter out of the room.
But Avdotya Romanovna seemed to await her turn, and following her mother
out, gave Sonia an attentive, courteous bow. Sonia, in confusion, gave
a hurried, frightened curtsy. There was a look of poignant discomfort
in her face, as though Avdotya Romanovnaâ€™s courtesy and attention were
oppressive and painful to her.

Dounia smiled, flushed, pulled her hand away, and went off quite happy.

Sonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his face. He looked

Perhaps worrying about us upset him. We must be patient, and much, much

hotly and jealously. â€œDo you know, Dounia, I was looking at you two. You
are the very portrait of him, and not so much in face as in soul. You
are both melancholy, both morose and hot-tempered, both haughty and both
generous.... Surely he canâ€™t be an egoist, Dounia. Eh? When I think of

â€œDounia, only think what a position we are in! What if Pyotr Petrovitch

contemptuously.

â€œHe was in a hurry about some business or other. If he gets out and has

crush you--carrying something. Why, it is a piano they have got, I

â€œWhat young woman, mother?

â€œI have a presentiment, Dounia. Well, you may believe it or not, but

â€œWell, you will see.... She worries me; but you will see, you will

scarcely sit still in my chair when he began introducing her, do you
remember? It seems so strange, but Pyotr Petrovitch writes like that
about her, and he introduces her to us--to you! So he must think a great

six roubles altogether... but I value them. So what am I to do now? I
do not want to lose the things, especially the watch. I was quaking just
now, for fear mother would ask to look at it, when we spoke of Douniaâ€™s
watch. It is the only thing of fatherâ€™s left us. She would be ill if
it were lost. You know what women are. So tell me what to do. I know I

He was not exactly ill at ease, but seemed hurried, and avoided her
eyes. Sonia gave her address, and flushed as she did so. They all went
out together.

She was extremely glad to escape at last; she went away looking down,
hurrying to get out of sight as soon as possible, to walk the twenty
steps to the turning on the right and to be at last alone, and then
moving rapidly along, looking at no one, noticing nothing, to think, to
remember, to meditate on every word, every detail. Never, never had she
felt anything like this. Dimly and unconsciously a whole new world was
opening before her. She remembered suddenly that Raskolnikov meant to
come to her that day, perhaps at once!

She was not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman who
was watching her and following at her heels. He had accompanied her from
the gateway. At the moment when Razumihin, Raskolnikov, and she stood
still at parting on the pavement, this gentleman, who was just passing,
started on hearing Soniaâ€™s words: â€œand I asked where Mr. Raskolnikov
NA
upon Raskolnikov, to whom Sonia was speaking; then looked back and noted
the house. All this was done in an instant as he passed, and trying not
to betray his interest, he walked on more slowly as though waiting for
something. He was waiting for Sonia; he saw that they were parting, and
that Sonia was going home.
NA
NA
At the turning he crossed over, looked round, and saw Sonia coming the
same way, noticing nothing. She turned the corner. He followed her on
the other side. After about fifty paces he crossed over again, overtook
her and kept two or three yards behind her.
He was a man about fifty, rather tall and thickly set, with broad high
shoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little. He wore
good and fashionable clothes, and looked like a gentleman of position.
He carried a handsome cane, which he tapped on the pavement at each
step; his gloves were spotless. He had a broad, rather pleasant face
with high cheek-bones and a fresh colour, not often seen in Petersburg.
His flaxen hair was still abundant, and only touched here and there with
grey, and his thick square beard was even lighter than his hair.
His eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look; his lips were
crimson. He was a remarkedly well-preserved man and looked much younger
than his years.
When Sonia came out on the canal bank, they were the only two persons on
the pavement. He observed her dreaminess and preoccupation. On reaching
the house where she lodged, Sonia turned in at the gate; he followed
her, seeming rather surprised. In the courtyard she turned to the right
NA
behind her. Only then Sonia noticed him. She reached the third storey,
turned down the passage, and rang at No. 9. On the door was inscribed

wondering at the strange coincidence, and he rang next door, at No. 8.
The doors were two or three yards apart.

Sonia made no reply; the door opened and she slipped in. She felt for
some reason ashamed and uneasy.

On the way to Porfiryâ€™s, Razumihin was obviously excited.

â€œI didnâ€™t know that you pledged things at the old womanâ€™s, too. And...

manners, but I mean clumsy in a different sense. He is an intelligent
fellow, very much so indeed, but he has his own range of ideas.... He
is incredulous, sceptical, cynical... he likes to impose on people, or
rather to make fun of them. His is the old, circumstantial method....
But he understands his work... thoroughly.... Last year he cleared up a
case of murder in which the police had hardly a clue. He is very, very

NA
â€œOh, itâ€™s not exactly... you see, since youâ€™ve been ill I happen to have

your being a law student and not able to finish your studies, he said,
â€˜What a pity!â€™ And so I concluded... from everything together, not only
that; yesterday Zametov... you know, Rodya, I talked some nonsense on
the way home to you yesterday, when I was drunk... I am afraid, brother,

NA
â€œYes, brother, I assure you itâ€™s noticeable. Why, you sat on your chair
in a way you never do sit, on the edge somehow, and you seemed to be
writhing all the time. You kept jumping up for nothing. One moment you
were angry, and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat. You even
blushed; especially when you were invited to dinner, you blushed

â€œBut why are you wriggling out of it, like a schoolboy? By Jove, there

â€œBut why are you so shamefaced about it? Romeo! Stay, Iâ€™ll tell of you

NA
Raskolnikov laughed as though he could not restrain himself. So
laughing, they entered Porfiry Petrovitchâ€™s flat. This is what
Raskolnikov wanted: from within they could be heard laughing as they
came in, still guffawing in the passage.
NA
seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder.
CHAPTER V
Raskolnikov was already entering the room. He came in looking as though
he had the utmost difficulty not to burst out laughing again. Behind him
Razumihin strode in gawky and awkward, shamefaced and red as a peony,
with an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression. His face and
whole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and amply justified
Raskolnikovâ€™s laughter. Raskolnikov, not waiting for an introduction,
bowed to Porfiry Petrovitch, who stood in the middle of the room
looking inquiringly at them. He held out his hand and shook hands, still
apparently making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a few
words to introduce himself. But he had no sooner succeeded in assuming
a serious air and muttering something when he suddenly glanced again as
though accidentally at Razumihin, and could no longer control himself:
his stifled laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried
to restrain it. The extraordinary ferocity with which Razumihin received

genuine fun and naturalness. Razumihin strengthened this impression as
though on purpose.
NA
little round table with an empty tea-glass on it. Everything was sent
flying and crashing.
NA
 Porfiry Petrovitch quoted gaily.
Raskolnikov was still laughing, with his hand in Porfiry Petrovitchâ€™s,
but anxious not to overdo it, awaited the right moment to put a natural
end to it. Razumihin, completely put to confusion by upsetting the table
and smashing the glass, gazed gloomily at the fragments, cursed and
turned sharply to the window where he stood looking out with his back
to the company with a fiercely scowling countenance, seeing nothing.
Porfiry Petrovitch laughed and was ready to go on laughing, but
obviously looked for explanations. Zametov had been sitting in the
corner, but he rose at the visitorsâ€™ entrance and was standing in
expectation with a smile on his lips, though he looked with surprise and
even it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at Raskolnikov with a
certain embarrassment. Zametovâ€™s unexpected presence struck Raskolnikov
unpleasantly.
NA
NA
â€œNot at all, very pleasant to see you... and how pleasantly youâ€™ve come
NA
at Razumihin.
â€œUpon my honour I donâ€™t know why he is in such a rage with me. I only
told him as we came along that he was like Romeo... and proved it. And
NA
NA
â€œThere must have been very grave grounds for it, if he is so furious at
NA
NA
bursting out laughing himself, he went up to Porfiry with a more
cheerful face as though nothing had happened. â€œThatâ€™ll do! We are
all fools. To come to business. This is my friend Rodion Romanovitch
Raskolnikov; in the first place he has heard of you and wants to make
your acquaintance, and secondly, he has a little matter of business with
you. Bah! Zametov, what brought you here? Have you met before? Have you
NA
NA
Zametov seemed taken aback, but not very much so.
NA
â€œThen I have been spared the trouble. All last week he was begging me
to introduce him to you. Porfiry and you have sniffed each other out
NA
Porfiry Petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown, very clean linen, and
trodden-down slippers. He was a man of about five and thirty, short,
stout even to corpulence, and clean shaven. He wore his hair cut short
and had a large round head, particularly prominent at the back. His
soft, round, rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish colour,
but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression. It would have been
good-natured except for a look in the eyes, which shone with a watery,
mawkish light under almost white, blinking eyelashes. The expression
of those eyes was strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish
figure, and gave it something far more serious than could be guessed at
first sight.
As soon as Porfiry Petrovitch heard that his visitor had a little matter
of business with him, he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down
himself on the other end, waiting for him to explain his business, with
that careful and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and
embarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if what you are
discussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such
exceptional solemnity. But in brief and coherent phrases Raskolnikov
explained his business clearly and exactly, and was so well satisfied
with himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry.
Porfiry Petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him. Razumihin,
sitting opposite at the same table, listened warmly and impatiently,
looking from one to the other every moment with rather excessive
interest.
NA
NA
most businesslike air, â€œthat having learnt of this incident, that is of
the murder, you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that such
and such things belong to you, and that you desire to redeem them...
NA
NA
his utmost to feign embarrassment, â€œI am not quite in funds... and
even this trifling sum is beyond me... I only wanted, you see, for
the present to declare that the things are mine, and that when I have
NA
NA
explanation of his pecuniary position coldly, â€œbut you can, if you
prefer, write straight to me, to say, that having been informed of the

NA
interested in the financial side of the question.
NA
obvious irony at him, screwing up his eyes and, as it were, winking at
him. But perhaps it was Raskolnikovâ€™s fancy, for it all lasted but a
moment. There was certainly something of the sort, Raskolnikov could
have sworn he winked at him, goodness knows why.
NA
NA
disconcerted, â€œthe things are only worth five roubles, but I prize them
particularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me, and I must

â€œThatâ€™s why you were so much struck when I mentioned to Zossimov that

This was really unbearable. Raskolnikov could not help glancing at him
with a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes, but immediately
recollected himself.
NA
well-feigned irritability. â€œI dare say I do seem to you absurdly anxious
about such trash; but you mustnâ€™t think me selfish or grasping for that,
and these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes. I told you
just now that the silver watch, though itâ€™s not worth a cent, is the
only thing left us of my fatherâ€™s. You may laugh at me, but my mother is

hurriedly to Razumihin, carefully making his voice tremble, â€œthat the
NA
NA
 shouted Razumihin distressed.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Porfiry paused as though reflecting.
NA
NA
And as though that was a matter of no importance, he carefully offered
the ash-tray to Razumihin, who was ruthlessly scattering cigarette ash
over the carpet. Raskolnikov shuddered, but Porfiry did not seem to be
looking at him, and was still concerned with Razumihinâ€™s cigarette.
NA
 cried Razumihin.
Porfiry Petrovitch addressed himself to Raskolnikov.
â€œYour things, the ring and the watch, were wrapped up together, and on
the paper your name was legibly written in pencil, together with the
NA
NA
utmost to look him straight in the face, but he failed, and suddenly
added:
â€œI say that because I suppose there were a great many pledges... that it
must be difficult to remember them all.... But you remember them all so
NA
NA
â€œBut we know all who had pledges, and you are the only one who hasnâ€™t

NA
â€œI heard that too. I heard, indeed, that you were in great distress

NA
out rudely and angrily, completely changing his tone. His anger was
mounting, he could not repress it. â€œAnd in my anger I shall betray
NA
NA
unconscious and delirious all yesterday. Would you believe, Porfiry, as
soon as our backs were turned, he dressed, though he could hardly stand,
and gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight,
NA
NA
womanish way.
NA
 Raskolnikov let slip in his anger. But Porfiry Petrovitch did not seem
to catch those strange words.
NA
 Razumihin got hot suddenly. â€œWhat did you go out for? What was the
object of it? And why on the sly? Were you in your senses when you did

NA
suddenly with a smile of insolent defiance, â€œI ran away from them to
take lodgings where they wouldnâ€™t find me, and took a lot of money with

He could have strangled Zametov at that moment, so hateful were his
expression and his silence to him.
â€œIn my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully, but you were

â€œMaybe I found a treasure somewhere and you know nothing of it? So
thatâ€™s why I was liberal yesterday.... Mr. Zametov knows Iâ€™ve found a
treasure! Excuse us, please, for disturbing you for half an hour
NA
NA
â€œOh no, quite the contrary, quite the contrary! If only you knew how you
interest me! Itâ€™s interesting to look on and listen... and I am really
NA
NA
â€œCapital idea! Perhaps we will all keep you company. Wouldnâ€™t you
NA
NA
Porfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea.
Raskolnikovâ€™s thoughts were in a whirl. He was in terrible exasperation.
â€œThe worst of it is they donâ€™t disguise it; they donâ€™t care to stand on
ceremony! And how if you didnâ€™t know me at all, did you come to talk
to Nikodim Fomitch about me? So they donâ€™t care to hide that they are
NA
shaking with rage. â€œCome, strike me openly, donâ€™t play with me like a
cat with a mouse. Itâ€™s hardly civil, Porfiry Petrovitch, but perhaps I
wonâ€™t allow it! I shall get up and throw the whole truth in your ugly
NA
â€œAnd what if itâ€™s only my fancy? What if I am mistaken, and through
inexperience I get angry and donâ€™t keep up my nasty part? Perhaps itâ€™s
all unintentional. All their phrases are the usual ones, but there is
something about them.... It all might be said, but there is something.
Why did he say bluntly, â€˜With herâ€™? Why did Zametov add that I spoke
artfully? Why do they speak in that tone? Yes, the tone.... Razumihin
is sitting here, why does he see nothing? That innocent blockhead never
does see anything! Feverish again! Did Porfiry wink at me just now? Of
course itâ€™s nonsense! What could he wink for? Are they trying to upset
my nerves or are they teasing me? Either itâ€™s ill fancy or they know!
Even Zametov is rude.... Is Zametov rude? Zametov has changed his mind.
I foresaw he would change his mind! He is at home here, while itâ€™s my
first visit. Porfiry does not consider him a visitor; sits with his back
to him. Theyâ€™re as thick as thieves, no doubt, over me! Not a doubt they
were talking about me before we came. Do they know about the flat? If
only theyâ€™d make haste! When I said that I ran away to take a flat he
let it pass.... I put that in cleverly about a flat, it may be of use
afterwards.... Delirious, indeed... ha-ha-ha! He knows all about last
night! He didnâ€™t know of my motherâ€™s arrival! The hag had written the
date on in pencil! You are wrong, you wonâ€™t catch me! There are no
facts... itâ€™s all supposition! You produce facts! The flat even isnâ€™t a
fact but delirium. I know what to say to them.... Do they know about the
flat? I wonâ€™t go without finding out. What did I come for? But my being
angry now, maybe is a fact! Fool, how irritable I am! Perhaps thatâ€™s
right; to play the invalid.... He is feeling me. He will try to catch

All this flashed like lightning through his mind.
Porfiry Petrovitch returned quickly. He became suddenly more jovial.
â€œYour party yesterday, brother, has left my head rather.... And I am out

Razumihin.
â€œWas it interesting? I left you yesterday at the most interesting point.
NA
â€œOh, no one, of course. They got on to everlasting questions, floated

â€œOnly fancy, Rodya, what we got on to yesterday. Whether there is such a

answered casually.
NA
NA
hurried as usual. â€œListen, Rodion, and tell us your opinion, I want to
hear it. I was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to
help me. I told them you were coming.... It began with the socialist
doctrine. You know their doctrine; crime is a protest against the
abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more, and nothing
NA
NA
animated and kept laughing as he looked at Razumihin, which made him
more excited than ever.
NA
â€œI am not wrong. Iâ€™ll show you their pamphlets. Everything with them
is â€˜the influence of environment,â€™ and nothing else. Their favourite
phrase! From which it follows that, if society is normally organised,
all crime will cease at once, since there will be nothing to protest
against and all men will become righteous in one instant. Human nature
is not taken into account, it is excluded, itâ€™s not supposed to exist!
They donâ€™t recognise that humanity, developing by a historical living
process, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that a
social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going
to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an
instant, quicker than any living process! Thatâ€™s why they instinctively
dislike history, â€˜nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,â€™ and they
explain it all as stupidity! Thatâ€™s why they so dislike the _living_
process of life; they donâ€™t want a _living soul_! The living soul
demands life, the soul wonâ€™t obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an
object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! But what they want though
it smells of death and can be made of India-rubber, at least is not
alive, has no will, is servile and wonâ€™t revolt! And it comes in the end
to their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning
of rooms and passages in a phalanstery! The phalanstery is ready,
indeed, but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery--it
wants life, it hasnâ€™t completed its vital process, itâ€™s too soon for the
graveyard! You canâ€™t skip over nature by logic. Logic presupposes three
possibilities, but there are millions! Cut away a million, and reduce
it all to the question of comfort! Thatâ€™s the easiest solution of the
problem! Itâ€™s seductively clear and you musnâ€™t think about it. Thatâ€™s
the great thing, you mustnâ€™t think! The whole secret of life in two

on purpose; you donâ€™t know him, Rodion! He took their side yesterday,
simply to make fools of them. And the things he said yesterday! And they
were delighted! He can keep it up for a fortnight together. Last year he
persuaded us that he was going into a monastery: he stuck to it for two
months. Not long ago he took it into his head to declare he was going
to get married, that he had everything ready for the wedding. He ordered
new clothes indeed. We all began to congratulate him. There was no

crime, environment, children, recall to my mind an article of yours
which interested me at the time. â€˜On Crimeâ€™... or something of the
sort, I forget the title, I read it with pleasure two months ago in the

astonishment. â€œI certainly did write an article upon a book six months

strange person you are! You lead such a solitary life that you know
nothing of matters that concern you directly. Itâ€™s a fact, I assure

What was the date? It doesnâ€™t matter though, I will find it. Think of

â€œI analysed, if I remember, the psychology of a criminal before and
NA
â€œYes, and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always
accompanied by illness. Very, very original, but... it was not that part
of your article that interested me so much, but an idea at the end of
the article which I regret to say you merely suggested without working
it out clearly. There is, if you recollect, a suggestion that there are
certain persons who can... that is, not precisely are able to, but have
a perfect right to commit breaches of morality and crimes, and that the
NA
Raskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional distortion of his
idea.
â€œWhat? What do you mean? A right to crime? But not because of the
NA
NA
men are divided into â€˜ordinaryâ€™ and â€˜extraordinary.â€™ Ordinary men have
to live in submission, have no right to transgress the law, because,
donâ€™t you see, they are ordinary. But extraordinary men have a right to
commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because they

NA
bewilderment.
Raskolnikov smiled again. He saw the point at once, and knew where they
wanted to drive him. He decided to take up the challenge.
NA
I admit that you have stated it almost correctly; perhaps, if you like,
NA
difference is that I donâ€™t contend that extraordinary people are always
bound to commit breaches of morals, as you call it. In fact, I doubt
whether such an argument could be published. I simply hinted that an
â€˜extraordinaryâ€™ man has the right... that is not an official right, but
an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep... certain
obstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment
of his idea (sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity).
You say that my article isnâ€™t definite; I am ready to make it as clear
as I can. Perhaps I am right in thinking you want me to; very well. I
maintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not have
been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a
hundred, or more men, Newton would have had the right, would indeed have
been in duty-bound... to _eliminate_ the dozen or the hundred men for
the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity. But
it does not follow from that that Newton had a right to murder people
right and left and to steal every day in the market. Then, I remember, I
maintain in my article that all... well, legislators and leaders of men,
such as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and so on, were all without
exception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they
transgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and held
sacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either,
if that bloodshed--often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence
of ancient law--were of use to their cause. Itâ€™s remarkable, in fact,
that the majority, indeed, of these benefactors and leaders of humanity
were guilty of terrible carnage. In short, I maintain that all great men
or even men a little out of the common, that is to say capable of giving
some new word, must from their very nature be criminals--more or less,
of course. Otherwise itâ€™s hard for them to get out of the common rut;
and to remain in the common rut is what they canâ€™t submit to, from their
very nature again, and to my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit to
it. You see that there is nothing particularly new in all that. The
same thing has been printed and read a thousand times before. As for my
division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I acknowledge that
itâ€™s somewhat arbitrary, but I donâ€™t insist upon exact numbers. I only
believe in my leading idea that men are _in general_ divided by a law
of nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say,
material that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who have
the gift or the talent to utter _a new word_. There are, of course,
innumerable sub-divisions, but the distinguishing features of both
categories are fairly well marked. The first category, generally
speaking, are men conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they live
under control and love to be controlled. To my thinking it is their duty
to be controlled, because thatâ€™s their vocation, and there is nothing
humiliating in it for them. The second category all transgress the
law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their
capacities. The crimes of these men are of course relative and varied;
for the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the
present for the sake of the better. But if such a one is forced for the
sake of his idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood, he can, I
maintain, find within himself, in his conscience, a sanction for wading
through blood--that depends on the idea and its dimensions, note that.
Itâ€™s only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my article
(you remember it began with the legal question). Thereâ€™s no need for
such anxiety, however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right,
they punish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so fulfil
quite justly their conservative vocation. But the same masses set these
criminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them (more or
less). The first category is always the man of the present, the second
the man of the future. The first preserve the world and people it, the
second move the world and lead it to its goal. Each class has an equal
right to exist. In fact, all have equal rights with me--and _vive la

â€œThank you. But tell me this: how do you distinguish those extraordinary
people from the ordinary ones? Are there signs at their birth? I feel
there ought to be more exactitude, more external definition. Excuse the
natural anxiety of a practical law-abiding citizen, but couldnâ€™t they
adopt a special uniform, for instance, couldnâ€™t they wear something, be
branded in some way? For you know if confusion arises and a member of
one category imagines that he belongs to the other, begins to â€˜eliminate
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo reason to; but take note that the mistake can only arise in
the first category, that is among the ordinary people (as I perhaps
unfortunately called them). In spite of their predisposition to
obedience very many of them, through a playfulness of nature, sometimes
vouchsafed even to the cow, like to imagine themselves advanced people,
â€˜destroyers,â€™ and to push themselves into the â€˜new movement,â€™ and
this quite sincerely. Meanwhile the really _new_ people are very often
unobserved by them, or even despised as reactionaries of grovelling
tendencies. But I donâ€™t think there is any considerable danger here,
and you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far. Of course,
they might have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away
with them and to teach them their place, but no more; in fact, even
this isnâ€™t necessary as they castigate themselves, for they are very
conscientious: some perform this service for one another and others
chastise themselves with their own hands.... They will impose various
public acts of penitence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying
effect; in fact youâ€™ve nothing to be uneasy about.... Itâ€™s a law of

â€œWell, you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score; but

same tone. â€œPeople with new ideas, people with the faintest capacity for
saying something _new_, are extremely few in number, extraordinarily
so in fact. One thing only is clear, that the appearance of all these
grades and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularity
some law of nature. That law, of course, is unknown at present, but I am
convinced that it exists, and one day may become known. The vast mass of
mankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some great effort,
by some mysterious process, by means of some crossing of races and
stocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a
thousand with a spark of independence. One in ten thousand perhaps--I
speak roughly, approximately--is born with some independence, and with
still greater independence one in a hundred thousand. The man of genius
is one of millions, and the great geniuses, the crown of humanity,
appear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions. In fact I have
not peeped into the retort in which all this takes place. But there
certainly is and must be a definite law, it cannot be a matter of

Raskolnikov raised his pale and almost mournful face and made no reply.
And the unconcealed, persistent, nervous, and _discourteous_ sarcasm of
Porfiry seemed strange to Razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face.
â€œWell, brother, if you are really serious... You are right, of course,
in saying that itâ€™s not new, that itâ€™s like what weâ€™ve read and heard a
thousand times already; but what is really original in all this, and is
exclusively your own, to my horror, is that you sanction bloodshed
_in the name of conscience_, and, excuse my saying so, with such
fanaticism.... That, I take it, is the point of your article. But that
sanction of bloodshed _by conscience_ is to my mind... more terrible

practical possibilities that make me uneasy! What if some man or youth
imagines that he is a Lycurgus or Mahomet--a future one of course--and
suppose he begins to remove all obstacles.... He has some great
enterprise before him and needs money for it... and tries to get it...

The last words were uttered in the passage. Porfiry Petrovitch saw them

perplexity to refute Raskolnikovâ€™s arguments.
They were by now approaching Bakaleyevâ€™s lodgings, where Pulcheria

by the very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly about

â€œQuite the contrary! If they had that brainless idea, they would do
their utmost to hide it, and conceal their cards, so as to catch you

â€œIf they had had facts--I mean, real facts--or at least grounds for
suspicion, then they would certainly have tried to hide their game,
in the hope of getting more (they would have made a search long ago
besides). But they have no facts, not one. It is all mirage--all
ambiguous. Simply a floating idea. So they try to throw me out by
impudence. And perhaps, he was irritated at having no facts, and blurted
it out in his vexation--or perhaps he has some plan... he seems an
intelligent man. Perhaps he wanted to frighten me by pretending to
know. They have a psychology of their own, brother. But it is loathsome
NA
â€œAnd itâ€™s insulting, insulting! I understand you. But... since we have
spoken openly now (and it is an excellent thing that we have at last--I
am glad) I will own now frankly that I noticed it in them long ago,
this idea. Of course the merest hint only--an insinuation--but why an
insinuation even? How dare they? What foundation have they? If only you
knew how furious I have been. Think only! Simply because a poor student,
unhinged by poverty and hypochondria, on the eve of a severe delirious
illness (note that), suspicious, vain, proud, who has not seen a soul to
speak to for six months, in rags and in boots without soles, has to
face some wretched policemen and put up with their insolence; and
the unexpected debt thrust under his nose, the I.O.U. presented
by Tchebarov, the new paint, thirty degrees Reaumur and a stifling
atmosphere, a crowd of people, the talk about the murder of a person
where he had been just before, and all that on an empty stomach--he
might well have a fainting fit! And that, that is what they found it
all on! Damn them! I understand how annoying it is, but in your place,
Rodya, I would laugh at them, or better still, spit in their ugly faces,
and spit a dozen times in all directions. Iâ€™d hit out in all
directions, neatly too, and so Iâ€™d put an end to it. Damn them! Donâ€™t be

You say that the question about the workmen was a trap. But if you had
done _that_, could you have said you had seen them painting the flat...
and the workmen? On the contrary, you would have seen nothing, even if
NA
â€œIf I had done _that thing_, I should certainly have said that I had

NA
â€œBecause only peasants, or the most inexperienced novices deny
everything flatly at examinations. If a man is ever so little developed
and experienced, he will certainly try to admit all the external facts
that canâ€™t be avoided, but will seek other explanations of them, will
introduce some special, unexpected turn, that will give them another
significance and put them in another light. Porfiry might well reckon
that I should be sure to answer so, and say I had seen them to give an

â€œBut he would have told you at once that the workmen could not have been

reflect, and should be in a hurry to make the most likely answer, and

â€œNothing easier. It is in just such stupid things clever people are most
easily caught. The more cunning a man is, the less he suspects that he
will be caught in a simple thing. The more cunning a man is, the simpler
the trap he must be caught in. Porfiry is not such a fool as you
NA
NA
Raskolnikov could not help laughing. But at the very moment, he was
struck by the strangeness of his own frankness, and the eagerness
with which he had made this explanation, though he had kept up all the
preceding conversation with gloomy repulsion, obviously with a motive,
from necessity.
NA
But almost at the same instant he became suddenly uneasy, as though an
unexpected and alarming idea had occurred to him. His uneasiness kept on
increasing. They had just reached the entrance to Bakaleyevâ€™s.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
irritation, such despair in his eyes that Razumihinâ€™s hands dropped.
He stood for some time on the steps, looking gloomily at Raskolnikov
striding rapidly away in the direction of his lodging. At last, gritting
his teeth and clenching his fist, he swore he would squeeze Porfiry
like a lemon that very day, and went up the stairs to reassure Pulcheria
Alexandrovna, who was by now alarmed at their long absence.
When Raskolnikov got home, his hair was soaked with sweat and he was
breathing heavily. He went rapidly up the stairs, walked into his
unlocked room and at once fastened the latch. Then in senseless terror
he rushed to the corner, to that hole under the paper where he had put
the things; put his hand in, and for some minutes felt carefully in the
hole, in every crack and fold of the paper. Finding nothing, he got up
and drew a deep breath. As he was reaching the steps of Bakaleyevâ€™s, he
suddenly fancied that something, a chain, a stud or even a bit of paper
in which they had been wrapped with the old womanâ€™s handwriting on it,
might somehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack, and then
might suddenly turn up as unexpected, conclusive evidence against him.
He stood as though lost in thought, and a strange, humiliated, half
senseless smile strayed on his lips. He took his cap at last and went
quietly out of the room. His ideas were all tangled. He went dreamily
through the gateway.
NA
He raised his head.
The porter was standing at the door of his little room and was pointing
him out to a short man who looked like an artisan, wearing a long coat
and a waistcoat, and looking at a distance remarkably like a woman. He
stooped, and his head in a greasy cap hung forward. From his wrinkled
flabby face he looked over fifty; his little eyes were lost in fat and
they looked out grimly, sternly and discontentedly.
NA
The man stole a look at him from under his brows and he looked at him
attentively, deliberately; then he turned slowly and went out of the
gate into the street without saying a word.
NA
â€œWhy, he there was asking whether a student lived here, mentioned your
name and whom you lodged with. I saw you coming and pointed you out and
NA
The porter too seemed rather puzzled, but not much so, and after
wondering for a moment he turned and went back to his room.
Raskolnikov ran after the stranger, and at once caught sight of
him walking along the other side of the street with the same even,
deliberate step with his eyes fixed on the ground, as though in
meditation. He soon overtook him, but for some time walked behind him.
At last, moving on to a level with him, he looked at his face. The man
noticed him at once, looked at him quickly, but dropped his eyes again;
and so they walked for a minute side by side without uttering a word.
NA
but in a curiously quiet voice.
The man made no answer; he didnâ€™t even look at him. Again they were both
silent.
â€œWhy do you... come and ask for me... and say nothing.... Whatâ€™s the
NA
Raskolnikovâ€™s voice broke and he seemed unable to articulate the words
clearly.
The man raised his eyes this time and turned a gloomy sinister look at
Raskolnikov.
NA
Raskolnikov went on walking beside him. His legs felt suddenly weak, a
cold shiver ran down his spine, and his heart seemed to stand still for
a moment, then suddenly began throbbing as though it were set free. So
they walked for about a hundred paces, side by side in silence.
The man did not look at him.
NA
Raskolnikov hardly audibly.
NA
emphatically, with a smile of triumphant hatred, and again he looked
straight into Raskolnikovâ€™s pale face and stricken eyes.
They had just reached the cross-roads. The man turned to the left
without looking behind him. Raskolnikov remained standing, gazing after
him. He saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him still
standing there. Raskolnikov could not see clearly, but he fancied that
he was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph.
With slow faltering steps, with shaking knees, Raskolnikov made his way
back to his little garret, feeling chilled all over. He took off his cap
and put it on the table, and for ten minutes he stood without moving.
Then he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he
stretched himself on it. So he lay for half an hour.
He thought of nothing. Some thoughts or fragments of thoughts, some
images without order or coherence floated before his mind--faces of
people he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once, whom he would
never have recalled, the belfry of the church at V., the billiard table
in a restaurant and some officers playing billiards, the smell of cigars
in some underground tobacco shop, a tavern room, a back staircase quite
dark, all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg-shells, and the
Sunday bells floating in from somewhere.... The images followed one
another, whirling like a hurricane. Some of them he liked and tried
to clutch at, but they faded and all the while there was an oppression
within him, but it was not overwhelming, sometimes it was even
pleasant.... The slight shivering still persisted, but that too
was an almost pleasant sensation.
He heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he closed his eyes and
pretended to be asleep. Razumihin opened the door and stood for some
time in the doorway as though hesitating, then he stepped softly into
the room and went cautiously to the sofa. Raskolnikov heard Nastasyaâ€™s
whisper:

NA
door. Another half-hour passed. Raskolnikov opened his eyes, turned on
his back again, clasping his hands behind his head.
â€œWho is he? Who is that man who sprang out of the earth? Where was he,
what did he see? He has seen it all, thatâ€™s clear. Where was he then?
And from where did he see? Why has he only now sprung out of the earth?

turning cold and shivering, â€œand the jewel case Nikolay found behind the
door--was that possible? A clue? You miss an infinitesimal line and you
can build it into a pyramid of evidence! A fly flew by and saw it! Is it

â€œAnd how dared I, knowing myself, knowing how I should be, take up an

â€œNo, those men are not made so. The real _Master_ to whom all is

with a jest at Vilna. And altars are set up to him after his death, and
so _all_ is permitted. No, such people, it seems, are not of flesh but

One sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh. Napoleon, the
pyramids, Waterloo, and a wretched skinny old woman, a pawnbroker with
a red trunk under her bed--itâ€™s a nice hash for Porfiry Petrovitch to
digest! How can they digest it! Itâ€™s too inartistic. â€œA Napoleon creep

At moments he felt he was raving. He sank into a state of feverish

incoherently. â€œThe old woman was a mistake perhaps, but she is not
what matters! The old woman was only an illness.... I was in a hurry to
overstep.... I didnâ€™t kill a human being, but a principle! I killed the
principle, but I didnâ€™t overstep, I stopped on this side.... I was
only capable of killing. And it seems I wasnâ€™t even capable of that...
Principle? Why was that fool Razumihin abusing the socialists? They are
industrious, commercial people; â€˜the happiness of allâ€™ is their case.
No, life is only given to me once and I shall never have it again; I
donâ€™t want to wait for â€˜the happiness of all.â€™ I want to live myself,
or else better not live at all. I simply couldnâ€™t pass by my mother
starving, keeping my rouble in my pocket while I waited for the
â€˜happiness of all.â€™ I am putting my little brick into the happiness of
all and so my heart is at peace. Ha-ha! Why have you let me slip? I only

possible, weighing, measuring and calculating. Of all the lice I picked

Allah commands and â€˜tremblingâ€™ creation must obey! The â€˜prophetâ€™ is
right, he is right when he sets a battery across the street and blows up
the innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain! Itâ€™s for you to
obey, trembling creation, and not _to have desires_, for thatâ€™s not for

His hair was soaked with sweat, his quivering lips were parched, his
eyes were fixed on the ceiling.
â€œMother, sister--how I loved them! Why do I hate them now? Yes, I hate
them, I feel a physical hatred for them, I canâ€™t bear them near me....
I went up to my mother and kissed her, I remember.... To embrace her
and think if she only knew... shall I tell her then? Thatâ€™s just what

himself to think, as it were struggling with delirium. â€œAh, how I hate
the old woman now! I feel I should kill her again if she came to life!

He lost consciousness; it seemed strange to him that he didnâ€™t remember
how he got into the street. It was late evening. The twilight had fallen
and the full moon was shining more and more brightly; but there was a
peculiar breathlessness in the air. There were crowds of people in the
street; workmen and business people were making their way home; other
people had come out for a walk; there was a smell of mortar, dust and
stagnant water. Raskolnikov walked along, mournful and anxious; he was
distinctly aware of having come out with a purpose, of having to do
something in a hurry, but what it was he had forgotten. Suddenly he
stood still and saw a man standing on the other side of the street,
beckoning to him. He crossed over to him, but at once the man turned and
walked away with his head hanging, as though he had made no sign to
NA
to overtake him. When he was within ten paces he recognised him and
was frightened; it was the same man with stooping shoulders in the long
coat. Raskolnikov followed him at a distance; his heart was beating;
they went down a turning; the man still did not look round. â€œDoes he
NA
gateway of a big house. Raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in
to see whether he would look round and sign to him. In the court-yard
the man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him. Raskolnikov at
once followed him into the yard, but the man was gone. He must have
gone up the first staircase. Raskolnikov rushed after him. He heard
slow measured steps two flights above. The staircase seemed strangely
familiar. He reached the window on the first floor; the moon shone
through the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light; then he
reached the second floor. Bah! this is the flat where the painters were
at work... but how was it he did not recognise it at once? The steps
of the man above had died away. â€œSo he must have stopped or hidden
NA
stillness that was dreadful.... But he went on. The sound of his own
footsteps scared and frightened him. How dark it was! The man must be
hiding in some corner here. Ah! the flat was standing wide open, he
hesitated and went in. It was very dark and empty in the passage, as
though everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour
which was flooded with moonlight. Everything there was as before, the
chairs, the looking-glass, the yellow sofa and the pictures in the
frames. A huge, round, copper-red moon looked in at the windows.
NA
Raskolnikov. He stood and waited, waited a long while, and the more
silent the moonlight, the more violently his heart beat, till it was
painful. And still the same hush. Suddenly he heard a momentary sharp
crack like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again. A fly
flew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz. At
that moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little
cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall. â€œWhy is that cloak
NA
and felt that there was someone hiding behind it. He cautiously moved
the cloak and saw, sitting on a chair in the corner, the old woman bent
double so that he couldnâ€™t see her face; but it was she. He stood over
NA
noose and struck her one blow, then another on the skull. But strange
to say she did not stir, as though she were made of wood. He was
frightened, bent down nearer and tried to look at her; but she, too,
bent her head lower. He bent right down to the ground and peeped up
into her face from below, he peeped and turned cold with horror: the old
woman was sitting and laughing, shaking with noiseless laughter, doing
her utmost that he should not hear it. Suddenly he fancied that the door
from the bedroom was opened a little and that there was laughter and
whispering within. He was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the
old woman on the head with all his force, but at every blow of the axe
the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old
woman was simply shaking with mirth. He was rushing away, but the
passage was full of people, the doors of the flats stood open and on the
landing, on the stairs and everywhere below there were people, rows of
heads, all looking, but huddled together in silence and expectation.
Something gripped his heart, his legs were rooted to the spot, they
would not move.... He tried to scream and woke up.
He drew a deep breath--but his dream seemed strangely to persist:
his door was flung open and a man whom he had never seen stood in the
doorway watching him intently.
Raskolnikov had hardly opened his eyes and he instantly closed them
again. He lay on his back without stirring.
NA
perceptibly; the stranger was standing in the same place, still watching
him.
He stepped cautiously into the room, carefully closing the door after
him, went up to the table, paused a moment, still keeping his eyes on
Raskolnikov, and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa; he
put his hat on the floor beside him and leaned his hands on his cane
and his chin on his hands. It was evident that he was prepared to wait
indefinitely. As far as Raskolnikov could make out from his stolen
glances, he was a man no longer young, stout, with a full, fair, almost
whitish beard.
Ten minutes passed. It was still light, but beginning to get dusk. There
was complete stillness in the room. Not a sound came from the stairs.
Only a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane. It was
unbearable at last. Raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa.

oddly, laughing calmly. â€œArkady Ivanovitch SvidrigaÃ¯lov, allow me to

PART IV
CHAPTER I
NA
He looked carefully and suspiciously at the unexpected visitor.
NA
bewilderment.
His visitor did not seem at all surprised at this exclamation.
â€œIâ€™ve come to you for two reasons. In the first place, I wanted to make
your personal acquaintance, as I have already heard a great deal about
you that is interesting and flattering; secondly, I cherish the hope
that you may not refuse to assist me in a matter directly concerning the
welfare of your sister, Avdotya Romanovna. For without your support she
might not let me come near her now, for she is prejudiced against me,
NA
NA
NA
Raskolnikov made no reply.
â€œIt was yesterday, I know. I only arrived myself the day before. Well,
let me tell you this, Rodion Romanovitch, I donâ€™t consider it necessary
to justify myself, but kindly tell me what was there particularly
criminal on my part in all this business, speaking without prejudice,
NA
Raskolnikov continued to look at him in silence.
â€œThat in my own house I persecuted a defenceless girl and â€˜insulted her
with my infamous proposalsâ€™--is that it? (I am anticipating you.) But
youâ€™ve only to assume that I, too, am a man _et nihil humanum_... in a
word, that I am capable of being attracted and falling in love (which
does not depend on our will), then everything can be explained in the
most natural manner. The question is, am I a monster, or am I myself
a victim? And what if I am a victim? In proposing to the object of my
passion to elope with me to America or Switzerland, I may have cherished
the deepest respect for her and may have thought that I was promoting
our mutual happiness! Reason is the slave of passion, you know; why,
NA
NA
simply that whether you are right or wrong, we dislike you. We donâ€™t
NA
SvidrigaÃ¯lov broke into a sudden laugh.
NA
the frankest way. â€œI hoped to get round you, but you took up the right
NA
NA
NA
is what the French call _bonne guerre_, and the most innocent form of
deception!... But still you have interrupted me; one way or another, I
repeat again: there would never have been any unpleasantness except for
NA
NA
interrupted rudely.
â€œOh, youâ€™ve heard that, too, then? Youâ€™d be sure to, though.... But
as for your question, I really donâ€™t know what to say, though my own
conscience is quite at rest on that score. Donâ€™t suppose that I am in
any apprehension about it. All was regular and in order; the medical
inquiry diagnosed apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy
dinner and a bottle of wine, and indeed it could have proved nothing
else. But Iâ€™ll tell you what I have been thinking to myself of late, on
my way here in the train, especially: didnâ€™t I contribute to all that...
calamity, morally, in a way, by irritation or something of the
sort. But I came to the conclusion that that, too, was quite out of the
NA
Raskolnikov laughed.
NA
â€œBut what are you laughing at? Only consider, I struck her just twice
with a switch--there were no marks even... donâ€™t regard me as a cynic,
please; I am perfectly aware how atrocious it was of me and all that;
but I know for certain, too, that Marfa Petrovna was very likely pleased
at my, so to say, warmth. The story of your sister had been wrung out to
the last drop; for the last three days Marfa Petrovna had been forced to
sit at home; she had nothing to show herself with in the town. Besides,
she had bored them so with that letter (you heard about her reading the
letter). And all of a sudden those two switches fell from heaven! Her
first act was to order the carriage to be got out.... Not to speak
of the fact that there are cases when women are very, very glad to be
insulted in spite of all their show of indignation. There are instances
of it with everyone; human beings in general, indeed, greatly love to
be insulted, have you noticed that? But itâ€™s particularly so with women.
NA
At one time Raskolnikov thought of getting up and walking out and so
finishing the interview. But some curiosity and even a sort of prudence
made him linger for a moment.
NA
NA
I scarcely ever fought. We lived very harmoniously, and she was always
pleased with me. I only used the whip twice in all our seven years (not
counting a third occasion of a very ambiguous character). The first
time, two months after our marriage, immediately after we arrived in the
country, and the last time was that of which we are speaking. Did you
suppose I was such a monster, such a reactionary, such a slave driver?
Ha, ha! By the way, do you remember, Rodion Romanovitch, how a few years
ago, in those days of beneficent publicity, a nobleman, Iâ€™ve forgotten
his name, was put to shame everywhere, in all the papers, for having
thrashed a German woman in the railway train. You remember? It was in
those days, that very year I believe, the â€˜disgraceful action of the
_Age_â€™ took place (you know, â€˜The Egyptian Nights,â€™ that public reading,
you remember? The dark eyes, you know! Ah, the golden days of our youth,
where are they?). Well, as for the gentleman who thrashed the German,
I feel no sympathy with him, because after all what need is there
for sympathy? But I must say that there are sometimes such provoking
â€˜Germansâ€™ that I donâ€™t believe there is a progressive who could quite
answer for himself. No one looked at the subject from that point of view
NA
After saying this, SvidrigaÃ¯lov broke into a sudden laugh again.
Raskolnikov saw clearly that this was a man with a firm purpose in his
mind and able to keep it to himself.
NA
â€œScarcely anyone. I suppose you are wondering at my being such an
NA
NA
â€œBecause I am not offended at the rudeness of your questions? Is that
NA
with a surprising expression of simplicity. â€œYou know, thereâ€™s
NA
â€œespecially now, Iâ€™ve nothing to do.... You are quite at liberty to
imagine though that I am making up to you with a motive, particularly as
I told you I want to see your sister about something. But Iâ€™ll confess
frankly, I am very much bored. The last three days especially, so I am
delighted to see you.... Donâ€™t be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, but you
seem to be somehow awfully strange yourself. Say what you like, thereâ€™s
something wrong with you, and now, too... not this very minute, I mean,
but now, generally.... Well, well, I wonâ€™t, I wonâ€™t, donâ€™t scowl! I am
NA
Raskolnikov looked gloomily at him.
NA
you are a man of very good breeding, or at least know how on occasion to

NA
answered, dryly and even with a shade of haughtiness, â€œand therefore why
not be vulgar at times when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak for our

added, laughing again.
â€œBut Iâ€™ve heard you have many friends here. You are, as they say, â€˜not
without connections.â€™ What can you want with me, then, unless youâ€™ve
NA
NA
replying to the chief point. â€œIâ€™ve met some already. Iâ€™ve been lounging
about for the last three days, and Iâ€™ve seen them, or theyâ€™ve seen me.
Thatâ€™s a matter of course. I am well dressed and reckoned not a poor
man; the emancipation of the serfs hasnâ€™t affected me; my property
consists chiefly of forests and water meadows. The revenue has not
fallen off; but... I am not going to see them, I was sick of them long
ago. Iâ€™ve been here three days and have called on no one.... What a town
it is! How has it come into existence among us, tell me that? A town of
officials and students of all sorts. Yes, thereâ€™s a great deal I didnâ€™t
notice when I was here eight years ago, kicking up my heels.... My only
NA
NA
â€œBut as for these clubs, Dussauts, parades, or progress, indeed,
NA
NA
NA
â€œHow could I help being? There was a regular set of us, men of the best
society, eight years ago; we had a fine time. And all men of breeding,
you know, poets, men of property. And indeed as a rule in our Russian
society the best manners are found among those whoâ€™ve been thrashed,
have you noticed that? Iâ€™ve deteriorated in the country. But I did get
into prison for debt, through a low Greek who came from Nezhin. Then
Marfa Petrovna turned up; she bargained with him and bought me off for
thirty thousand silver pieces (I owed seventy thousand). We were united
in lawful wedlock and she bore me off into the country like a treasure.
You know she was five years older than I. She was very fond of me. For
seven years I never left the country. And, take note, that all my life
she held a document over me, the IOU for thirty thousand roubles, so
if I were to elect to be restive about anything I should be trapped at
once! And she would have done it! Women find nothing incompatible in
NA
NA
â€œI donâ€™t know what to say. It was scarcely the document restrained me. I
didnâ€™t want to go anywhere else. Marfa Petrovna herself invited me to go
abroad, seeing I was bored, but Iâ€™ve been abroad before, and always
felt sick there. For no reason, but the sunrise, the bay of Naples, the
sea--you look at them and it makes you sad. Whatâ€™s most revolting is
that one is really sad! No, itâ€™s better at home. Here at least one
blames others for everything and excuses oneself. I should have gone
perhaps on an expedition to the North Pole, because _jâ€™ai le vin
mauvais_ and hate drinking, and thereâ€™s nothing left but wine. I have
tried it. But, I say, Iâ€™ve been told Berg is going up in a great balloon
next Sunday from the Yusupov Garden and will take up passengers at a

NA
NA
thought.
NA
NA
meditatively. â€œIt was my own doing, not leaving the country, and nearly
a year ago Marfa Petrovna gave me back the document on my name-day
and made me a present of a considerable sum of money, too. She had a
fortune, you know. â€˜You see how I trust you, Arkady Ivanovitchâ€™--that
was actually her expression. You donâ€™t believe she used it? But do
you know I managed the estate quite decently, they know me in the
neighbourhood. I ordered books, too. Marfa Petrovna at first approved,

NA
â€œMissing her? Perhaps. Really, perhaps I am. And, by the way, do you

NA
SvidrigaÃ¯lov looked at him rather oddly.
NA
into a strange smile.
NA
â€œShe has been three times. I saw her first on the very day of the
funeral, an hour after she was buried. It was the day before I left to
come here. The second time was the day before yesterday, at daybreak, on
the journey at the station of Malaya Vishera, and the third time was two

NA

a minute and goes out at the door--always at the door. I can almost hear

At the same moment he was surprised at having said it. He was much
excited.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI thought I did. When I came in and saw you lying with your eyes shut,
NA
NA
Raskolnikov.
NA
ingenuously, as though he, too, were puzzled.
For a minute they were silent. They stared in each otherâ€™s faces.
NA
NA
â€œShe! Would you believe it, she talks of the silliest trifles and--man
is a strange creature--it makes me angry. The first time she came in (I
was tired you know: the funeral service, the funeral ceremony, the lunch
afterwards. At last I was left alone in my study. I lighted a cigar and
began to think), she came in at the door. â€˜Youâ€™ve been so busy to-day,
Arkady Ivanovitch, you have forgotten to wind the dining-room clock,â€™
she said. All those seven years Iâ€™ve wound that clock every week, and if
I forgot it she would always remind me. The next day I set off on my way
here. I got out at the station at daybreak; Iâ€™d been asleep, tired out,
with my eyes half open, I was drinking some coffee. I looked up and
there was suddenly Marfa Petrovna sitting beside me with a pack of
cards in her hands. â€˜Shall I tell your fortune for the journey, Arkady
Ivanovitch?â€™ She was a great hand at telling fortunes. I shall never
forgive myself for not asking her to. I ran away in a fright, and,
besides, the bell rang. I was sitting to-day, feeling very heavy after a
miserable dinner from a cookshop; I was sitting smoking, all of a sudden
Marfa Petrovna again. She came in very smart in a new green silk dress
with a long train. â€˜Good day, Arkady Ivanovitch! How do you like my
dress? Aniska canâ€™t make like this.â€™ (Aniska was a dressmaker in the
country, one of our former serf girls who had been trained in Moscow, a
pretty wench.) She stood turning round before me. I looked at the dress,
and then I looked carefully, very carefully, at her face. â€˜I wonder
you trouble to come to me about such trifles, Marfa Petrovna.â€™ â€˜Good
gracious, you wonâ€™t let one disturb you about anything!â€™ To tease her
I said, â€˜I want to get married, Marfa Petrovna.â€™ â€˜Thatâ€™s just like you,
Arkady Ivanovitch; it does you very little credit to come looking for a
bride when youâ€™ve hardly buried your wife. And if you could make a good
choice, at least, but I know it wonâ€™t be for your happiness or hers, you
will only be a laughing-stock to all good people.â€™ Then she went out and
NA
NA
NA
noticing the rudeness of the question.
NA
â€œY-yes, I have seen them, but only once in my life, six years ago. I had
a serf, Filka; just after his burial I called out forgetting â€˜Filka, my
pipe!â€™ He came in and went to the cupboard where my pipes were. I sat
still and thought â€˜he is doing it out of revenge,â€™ because we had a
violent quarrel just before his death. â€˜How dare you come in with a hole
in your elbow?â€™ I said. â€˜Go away, you scamp!â€™ He turned and went out,
and never came again. I didnâ€™t tell Marfa Petrovna at the time. I wanted
NA
NA
â€œI know I am not well, without your telling me, though I donâ€™t know
whatâ€™s wrong; I believe I am five times as strong as you are. I didnâ€™t
ask you whether you believe that ghosts are seen, but whether you

NA
NA
speaking to himself, looking aside and bowing his head. â€œThey say, â€˜You
are ill, so what appears to you is only unreal fantasy.â€™ But thatâ€™s not
strictly logical. I agree that ghosts only appear to the sick, but that
only proves that they are unable to appear except to the sick, not that
NA
NA
NA
deliberately. â€œBut what do you say to this argument (help me with
it): ghosts are, as it were, shreds and fragments of other worlds, the
beginning of them. A man in health has, of course, no reason to see
them, because he is above all a man of this earth and is bound for the
sake of completeness and order to live only in this life. But as soon
as one is ill, as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is
broken, one begins to realise the possibility of another world; and the
more seriously ill one is, the closer becomes oneâ€™s contact with that
other world, so that as soon as the man dies he steps straight into that
world. I thought of that long ago. If you believe in a future life, you

NA
SvidrigaÃ¯lov sat lost in thought.
NA
 he said suddenly.
NA
â€œWe always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception,
something vast, vast! But why must it be vast? Instead of all that, what
if itâ€™s one little room, like a bath house in the country, black
and grimy and spiders in every corner, and thatâ€™s all eternity is? I

â€œCan it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than

â€œJuster? And how can we tell, perhaps that is just, and do you know

vague smile.
This horrible answer sent a cold chill through Raskolnikov. SvidrigaÃ¯lov
raised his head, looked at him, and suddenly began laughing.
NA
we regarded each other as enemies; there is a matter unsettled between
us; weâ€™ve thrown it aside, and away weâ€™ve gone into the abstract! Wasnâ€™t
NA
NA
why you have honoured me with your visit... and... and I am in a hurry,
NA
â€œBy all means, by all means. Your sister, Avdotya Romanovna, is going to

â€œCan you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioning
her name? I canâ€™t understand how you dare utter her name in my presence,
NA
â€œWhy, but Iâ€™ve come here to speak about her; how can I avoid mentioning
NA
NA
â€œI am sure that you must have formed your own opinion of this Mr.
Luzhin, who is a connection of mine through my wife, if you have only
seen him for half an hour, or heard any facts about him. He is no
match for Avdotya Romanovna. I believe Avdotya Romanovna is sacrificing
herself generously and imprudently for the sake of... for the sake of
her family. I fancied from all I had heard of you that you would be very
glad if the match could be broken off without the sacrifice of worldly
NA
â€œAll this is very naÃ¯ve... excuse me, I should have said impudent on
NA
â€œYou mean to say that I am seeking my own ends. Donâ€™t be uneasy, Rodion
Romanovitch, if I were working for my own advantage, I would not have
spoken out so directly. I am not quite a fool. I will confess something
psychologically curious about that: just now, defending my love for
Avdotya Romanovna, I said I was myself the victim. Well, let me tell you
that Iâ€™ve no feeling of love now, not the slightest, so that I wonder
NA
NA
â€œI certainly am idle and depraved, but your sister has such qualities
that even I could not help being impressed by them. But thatâ€™s all
NA
NA
â€œI began to be aware of it before, but was only perfectly sure of it the
day before yesterday, almost at the moment I arrived in Petersburg. I
still fancied in Moscow, though, that I was coming to try to get Avdotya
NA
â€œExcuse me for interrupting you; kindly be brief, and come to the object
NA
â€œWith the greatest pleasure. On arriving here and determining on a
certain... journey, I should like to make some necessary preliminary
arrangements. I left my children with an aunt; they are well provided
for; and they have no need of me personally. And a nice father I should
make, too! I have taken nothing but what Marfa Petrovna gave me a year
ago. Thatâ€™s enough for me. Excuse me, I am just coming to the point.
Before the journey which may come off, I want to settle Mr. Luzhin, too.
Itâ€™s not that I detest him so much, but it was through him I quarrelled
with Marfa Petrovna when I learned that she had dished up this marriage.
I want now to see Avdotya Romanovna through your mediation, and if you
like in your presence, to explain to her that in the first place she
will never gain anything but harm from Mr. Luzhin. Then, begging
her pardon for all past unpleasantness, to make her a present of ten
thousand roubles and so assist the rupture with Mr. Luzhin, a rupture to
which I believe she is herself not disinclined, if she could see the way
NA
NA
NA
â€œI knew you would scream at me; but in the first place, though I am not
rich, this ten thousand roubles is perfectly free; I have absolutely no
need for it. If Avdotya Romanovna does not accept it, I shall waste
it in some more foolish way. Thatâ€™s the first thing. Secondly, my
conscience is perfectly easy; I make the offer with no ulterior motive.
You may not believe it, but in the end Avdotya Romanovna and you will
know. The point is, that I did actually cause your sister, whom I
greatly respect, some trouble and unpleasantness, and so, sincerely
regretting it, I want--not to compensate, not to repay her for the
unpleasantness, but simply to do something to her advantage, to show
that I am not, after all, privileged to do nothing but harm. If there
were a millionth fraction of self-interest in my offer, I should not
have made it so openly; and I should not have offered her ten thousand
only, when five weeks ago I offered her more, Besides, I may, perhaps,
very soon marry a young lady, and that alone ought to prevent suspicion
of any design on Avdotya Romanovna. In conclusion, let me say that
in marrying Mr. Luzhin, she is taking money just the same, only from
another man. Donâ€™t be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, think it over coolly
NA
SvidrigaÃ¯lov himself was exceedingly cool and quiet as he was saying
this.
NA
NA
â€œNot in the least. Then a man may do nothing but harm to his neighbour
in this world, and is prevented from doing the tiniest bit of good
by trivial conventional formalities. Thatâ€™s absurd. If I died, for
instance, and left that sum to your sister in my will, surely she
NA
NA
â€œOh, no, indeed. However, if you refuse it, so be it, though ten
thousand roubles is a capital thing to have on occasion. In any case I
NA
NA
â€œIn that case, Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be obliged to try and see her
NA
NA
â€œI donâ€™t know really what to say. I should like very much to see her
NA
NA
â€œIâ€™m sorry. But you donâ€™t know me. Perhaps we may become better
NA
NA
NA
â€œI didnâ€™t quite intend to disturb you and I came here without reckoning
NA
NA
â€œI saw you by chance.... I kept fancying there is something about you
like me.... But donâ€™t be uneasy. I am not intrusive; I used to get on
all right with card-sharpers, and I never bored Prince Svirbey, a great
personage who is a distant relation of mine, and I could write about
Raphaelâ€™s _Madonna_ in Madam Prilukovâ€™s album, and I never left Marfa
Petrovnaâ€™s side for seven years, and I used to stay the night at
Viazemskyâ€™s house in the Hay Market in the old days, and I may go up in
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œA journey? Oh, yes. I did speak of a journey. Well, thatâ€™s a wide
NA
a sudden, loud, short laugh. â€œPerhaps Iâ€™ll get married instead of the
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œBut I am very anxious to see Avdotya Romanovna once. I earnestly beg
it. Well, good-bye for the present. Oh, yes. I have forgotten something.
Tell your sister, Rodion Romanovitch, that Marfa Petrovna remembered
her in her will and left her three thousand roubles. Thatâ€™s absolutely
certain. Marfa Petrovna arranged it a week before her death, and it was
done in my presence. Avdotya Romanovna will be able to receive the money

As he went out, SvidrigaÃ¯lov ran up against Razumihin in the doorway.

It was nearly eight oâ€™clock. The two young men hurried to Bakaleyevâ€™s,

street.
â€œIt was SvidrigaÃ¯lov, that landowner in whose house my sister was
insulted when she was their governess. Through his persecuting her with
his attentions, she was turned out by his wife, Marfa Petrovna. This
Marfa Petrovna begged Douniaâ€™s forgiveness afterwards, and sheâ€™s just
died suddenly. It was of her we were talking this morning. I donâ€™t
know why Iâ€™m afraid of that man. He came here at once after his wifeâ€™s
funeral. He is very strange, and is determined on doing something.... We
must guard Dounia from him... thatâ€™s what I wanted to tell you, do you

still with him. I tried to begin, but it was no use. I couldnâ€™t speak in
the right way. They donâ€™t seem to understand and canâ€™t understand, but
are not a bit ashamed. I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talking
to him, but it was still no use. He looked away and I looked away. At
last I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him as a cousin Iâ€™d
brain him. He merely looked at me, I cursed and came away. That was
all. It was very stupid. To Zametov I didnâ€™t say a word. But, you see, I
thought Iâ€™d made a mess of it, but as I went downstairs a brilliant idea
struck me: why should we trouble? Of course if you were in any danger
or anything, but why need you care? You neednâ€™t care a hang for them. We
shall have a laugh at them afterwards, and if I were in your place Iâ€™d
mystify them more than ever. How ashamed theyâ€™ll be afterwards! Hang
NA
NA
 he thought to himself. Strange to say, till that moment it had never
occurred to him to wonder what Razumihin would think when he knew. As he
thought it, Raskolnikov looked at him. Razumihinâ€™s account of his visit
to Porfiry had very little interest for him, so much had come and gone
since then.
In the corridor they came upon Luzhin; he had arrived punctually
at eight, and was looking for the number, so that all three went in
together without greeting or looking at one another. The young men
walked in first, while Pyotr Petrovitch, for good manners, lingered a
little in the passage, taking off his coat. Pulcheria Alexandrovna came
forward at once to greet him in the doorway, Dounia was welcoming her
brother. Pyotr Petrovitch walked in and quite amiably, though with
redoubled dignity, bowed to the ladies. He looked, however, as though
he were a little put out and could not yet recover himself. Pulcheria
Alexandrovna, who seemed also a little embarrassed, hastened to make
them all sit down at the round table where a samovar was boiling. Dounia
and Luzhin were facing one another on opposite sides of the table.
Razumihin and Raskolnikov were facing Pulcheria Alexandrovna, Razumihin
was next to Luzhin and Raskolnikov was beside his sister.
A momentâ€™s silence followed. Pyotr Petrovitch deliberately drew out a
cambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his nose with an air of
a benevolent man who felt himself slighted, and was firmly resolved to
insist on an explanation. In the passage the idea had occurred to him to
keep on his overcoat and walk away, and so give the two ladies a sharp
and emphatic lesson and make them feel the gravity of the position.
But he could not bring himself to do this. Besides, he could not endure
uncertainty, and he wanted an explanation: if his request had been so
openly disobeyed, there was something behind it, and in that case it was
better to find it out beforehand; it rested with him to punish them and
there would always be time for that.

â€œI am gratified to hear it. And Avdotya Romanovna is not over-fatigued

hostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he scowled and was silent.
Pyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of persons, on the surface very
polite in society, who make a great point of punctiliousness, but who,
directly they are crossed in anything, are completely disconcerted, and
become more like sacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society.
Again all was silent; Raskolnikov was obstinately mute, Avdotya
Romanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too soon. Razumihin had
nothing to say, so Pulcheria Alexandrovna was anxious again.
NA
her leading item of conversation.
â€œTo be sure, I heard so. I was immediately informed, and I have come to
make you acquainted with the fact that Arkady Ivanovitch SvidrigaÃ¯lov
set off in haste for Petersburg immediately after his wifeâ€™s funeral. So
NA
NA
â€œYes, indeed, and doubtless not without some design, having in view the
NA

Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
â€œI imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna have any grounds for
uneasiness, unless, of course, you are yourselves desirous of getting
into communication with him. For my part I am on my guard, and am now
NA
â€œOh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you would not believe what a fright you have
NA
but I thought him terrible, terrible! I am convinced that he was the
NA
â€œItâ€™s impossible to be certain about that. I have precise information. I
do not dispute that he may have contributed to accelerate the course of
events by the moral influence, so to say, of the affront; but as to the
general conduct and moral characteristics of that personage, I am
in agreement with you. I do not know whether he is well off now, and
precisely what Marfa Petrovna left him; this will be known to me within
a very short period; but no doubt here in Petersburg, if he has any
pecuniary resources, he will relapse at once into his old ways. He is
the most depraved, and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of men.
I have considerable reason to believe that Marfa Petrovna, who was so
unfortunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight years
ago, was of service to him also in another way. Solely by her exertions
and sacrifices, a criminal charge, involving an element of fantastic
and homicidal brutality for which he might well have been sentenced to
Siberia, was hushed up. Thatâ€™s the sort of man he is, if you care to
NA
NA
attentively.
â€œAre you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence of
NA
â€œI only repeat what I was told in secret by Marfa Petrovna. I must
observe that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear.
There was, and I believe still is, living here a woman called Resslich,
a foreigner, who lent small sums of money at interest, and did other
commissions, and with this woman SvidrigaÃ¯lov had for a long while close
and mysterious relations. She had a relation, a niece I believe, living
with her, a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen, or perhaps not more than
fourteen. Resslich hated this girl, and grudged her every crust; she
used to beat her mercilessly. One day the girl was found hanging in
the garret. At the inquest the verdict was suicide. After the usual
proceedings the matter ended, but, later on, information was given that
the child had been... cruelly outraged by SvidrigaÃ¯lov. It is true, this
was not clearly established, the information was given by another German
woman of loose character whose word could not be trusted; no statement
was actually made to the police, thanks to Marfa Petrovnaâ€™s money and
exertions; it did not get beyond gossip. And yet the story is a very
significant one. You heard, no doubt, Avdotya Romanovna, when you were
with them the story of the servant Philip who died of ill treatment he
NA
NA
â€œQuite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps disposed him,
to suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of Mr.
NA
NA
that Philip was a sort of hypochondriac, a sort of domestic philosopher,
the servants used to say, â€˜he read himself silly,â€™ and that he hanged
himself partly on account of Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lovâ€™s mockery of him and not
his blows. When I was there he behaved well to the servants, and they
were actually fond of him, though they certainly did blame him for
NA
â€œI perceive, Avdotya Romanovna, that you seem disposed to undertake his
NA
an ambiguous smile, â€œthereâ€™s no doubt that he is an astute man, and
insinuating where ladies are concerned, of which Marfa Petrovna, who has
died so strangely, is a terrible instance. My only desire has been to be
of service to you and your mother with my advice, in view of the renewed
efforts which may certainly be anticipated from him. For my part itâ€™s
my firm conviction, that he will end in a debtorâ€™s prison again.
Marfa Petrovna had not the slightest intention of settling anything
substantial on him, having regard for his childrenâ€™s interests, and,
if she left him anything, it would only be the merest sufficiency,
something insignificant and ephemeral, which would not last a year for a
NA
NA
NA

the first time.
There were exclamations from all, and they all turned to him. Even Pyotr
Petrovitch was roused.
â€œAn hour and a half ago, he came in when I was asleep, waked me, and
NA
and at ease, and quite hopes that we shall become friends. He is
particularly anxious, by the way, Dounia, for an interview with you, at
which he asked me to assist. He has a proposition to make to you, and
he told me about it. He told me, too, that a week before her death Marfa
Petrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, Dounia, and that

interrupted with some impatience. â€œPlease understand that our whole
future depends now on whether all this is explained and set right as

business must be ended to-day, however hard that may be. I repeat that

me, I shall be capable of judging impartially. My assuming the part of
judge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you. When I insisted
on his coming to our interview to-day after your letter, I told
him nothing of what I meant to do. Understand that, if you are not
reconciled, I must choose between you--it must be either you or he. That
is how the question rests on your side and on his. I donâ€™t want to be
mistaken in my choice, and I must not be. For your sake I must break off
with my brother, for my brotherâ€™s sake I must break off with you. I can

malicious intentions, and, as far as I could see, relied upon your

Pulcheria Alexandrovna was a little offended.

Pyotr Petrovitch had apparently not at all expected such a conclusion.
He had too much confidence in himself, in his power and in the
helplessness of his victims. He could not believe it even now. He turned
pale, and his lips quivered.

This last complaint was so characteristic of Pyotr Petrovitch, that
Raskolnikov, pale with anger and with the effort of restraining it,
could not help breaking into laughter. But Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
furious.

Pyotr Petrovitch gazed at him for some seconds with a pale face that
worked with anger, then he turned, went out, and rarely has any man
carried away in his heart such vindictive hatred as he felt against
Raskolnikov. Him, and him alone, he blamed for everything. It is
noteworthy that as he went downstairs he still imagined that his case
was perhaps not utterly lost, and that, so far as the ladies were
NA
CHAPTER III
The fact was that up to the last moment he had never expected such an
ending; he had been overbearing to the last degree, never dreaming that
two destitute and defenceless women could escape from his control. This
conviction was strengthened by his vanity and conceit, a conceit to
the point of fatuity. Pyotr Petrovitch, who had made his way up from
insignificance, was morbidly given to self-admiration, had the highest
opinion of his intelligence and capacities, and sometimes even gloated
in solitude over his image in the glass. But what he loved and valued
above all was the money he had amassed by his labour, and by all sorts
of devices: that money made him the equal of all who had been his
superiors.
When he had bitterly reminded Dounia that he had decided to take her in
spite of evil report, Pyotr Petrovitch had spoken with perfect sincerity
NA
 And yet, when he made Dounia his offer, he was fully aware of the
groundlessness of all the gossip. The story had been everywhere
contradicted by Marfa Petrovna, and was by then disbelieved by all the
townspeople, who were warm in Douniaâ€™a defence. And he would not have
denied that he knew all that at the time. Yet he still thought highly
of his own resolution in lifting Dounia to his level and regarded it as
something heroic. In speaking of it to Dounia, he had let out the secret
feeling he cherished and admired, and he could not understand that
others should fail to admire it too. He had called on Raskolnikov with
the feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his good
deeds and to hear agreeable flattery. And as he went downstairs now, he
considered himself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised.
Dounia was simply essential to him; to do without her was unthinkable.
For many years he had had voluptuous dreams of marriage, but he had
gone on waiting and amassing money. He brooded with relish, in profound
secret, over the image of a girl--virtuous, poor (she must be poor),
very young, very pretty, of good birth and education, very timid, one
who had suffered much, and was completely humbled before him, one who
would all her life look on him as her saviour, worship him, admire him
and only him. How many scenes, how many amorous episodes he had imagined
on this seductive and playful theme, when his work was over! And,
behold, the dream of so many years was all but realised; the beauty and
education of Avdotya Romanovna had impressed him; her helpless position
had been a great allurement; in her he had found even more than he
dreamed of. Here was a girl of pride, character, virtue, of education
and breeding superior to his own (he felt that), and this creature would
be slavishly grateful all her life for his heroic condescension, and
would humble herself in the dust before him, and he would have absolute,
unbounded power over her!... Not long before, he had, too, after long
reflection and hesitation, made an important change in his career and
was now entering on a wider circle of business. With this change his
cherished dreams of rising into a higher class of society seemed likely
to be realised.... He was, in fact, determined to try his fortune
in Petersburg. He knew that women could do a very great deal. The
fascination of a charming, virtuous, highly educated woman might make
his way easier, might do wonders in attracting people to him, throwing
an aureole round him, and now everything was in ruins! This sudden
horrible rupture affected him like a clap of thunder; it was like a
hideous joke, an absurdity. He had only been a tiny bit masterful,
had not even time to speak out, had simply made a joke, been carried
away--and it had ended so seriously. And, of course, too, he did love
Dounia in his own way; he already possessed her in his dreams--and all
at once! No! The next day, the very next day, it must all be set right,
smoothed over, settled. Above all he must crush that conceited milksop
who was the cause of it all. With a sick feeling he could not help
recalling Razumihin too, but, he soon reassured himself on that score;
as though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him! The man
he really dreaded in earnest was SvidrigaÃ¯lov.... He had, in short, a
great deal to attend to....

embracing her mother. â€œI was tempted by his money, but on my honour,
brother, I had no idea he was such a base man. If I had seen through him
NA
NA
muttered, but half consciously, as though scarcely able to realise what
had happened.
They were all relieved, and in five minutes they were laughing. Only now
and then Dounia turned white and frowned, remembering what had passed.
Pulcheria Alexandrovna was surprised to find that she, too, was glad:
she had only that morning thought rupture with Luzhin a terrible
misfortune. Razumihin was delighted. He did not yet dare to express his
joy fully, but he was in a fever of excitement as though a ton-weight
had fallen off his heart. Now he had the right to devote his life to
them, to serve them.... Anything might happen now! But he felt afraid to
think of further possibilities and dared not let his imagination
range. But Raskolnikov sat still in the same place, almost sullen and
indifferent. Though he had been the most insistent on getting rid of
Luzhin, he seemed now the least concerned at what had happened. Dounia
could not help thinking that he was still angry with her, and Pulcheria
Alexandrovna watched him timidly.
NA
NA
Raskolnikov raised his head.
â€œHe wants to make you a present of ten thousand roubles and he desires
NA
NA
NA
Then Raskolnikov repeated (rather dryly) his conversation with
SvidrigaÃ¯lov, omitting his account of the ghostly visitations of Marfa
Petrovna, wishing to avoid all unnecessary talk.
NA
â€œAt first I said I would not take any message to you. Then he said that
he would do his utmost to obtain an interview with you without my help.
He assured me that his passion for you was a passing infatuation, now he
has no feeling for you. He doesnâ€™t want you to marry Luzhin.... His talk
NA
NA
â€œI must confess I donâ€™t quite understand him. He offers you ten
thousand, and yet says he is not well off. He says he is going away, and
in ten minutes he forgets he has said it. Then he says he is going to be
married and has already fixed on the girl.... No doubt he has a motive,
and probably a bad one. But itâ€™s odd that he should be so clumsy about
it if he had any designs against you.... Of course, I refused this
money on your account, once for all. Altogether, I thought him very
strange.... One might almost think he was mad. But I may be mistaken;
that may only be the part he assumes. The death of Marfa Petrovna seems

always pray for her! Where should we be now, Dounia, without this three

morning we had only three roubles in our pocket and Dounia and I were
just planning to pawn her watch, so as to avoid borrowing from that man

Dounia seemed strangely impressed by SvidrigaÃ¯lovâ€™s offer. She still
stood meditating.

almost shuddering.
Raskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror.
NA
Dounia.
NA
â€œI wonâ€™t lose sight of him. Rodya has given me leave. He said to me
himself just now. â€˜Take care of my sister.â€™ Will you give me leave, too,
NA
Dounia smiled and held out her hand, but the look of anxiety did not
leave her face. Pulcheria Alexandrovna gazed at her timidly, but the
three thousand roubles had obviously a soothing effect on her.
A quarter of an hour later, they were all engaged in a lively
conversation. Even Raskolnikov listened attentively for some time,
though he did not talk. Razumihin was the speaker.
NA
are you to do in a little town? The great thing is, you are all here
together and you need one another--you do need one another, believe me.
For a time, anyway.... Take me into partnership, and I assure you weâ€™ll
plan a capital enterprise. Listen! Iâ€™ll explain it all in detail to
you, the whole project! It all flashed into my head this morning,
before anything had happened... I tell you what; I have an uncle, I must
introduce him to you (a most accommodating and respectable old man).
This uncle has got a capital of a thousand roubles, and he lives on his
pension and has no need of that money. For the last two years he has
been bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six per cent.
interest. I know what that means; he simply wants to help me. Last year
I had no need of it, but this year I resolved to borrow it as soon as
he arrived. Then you lend me another thousand of your three and we have
enough for a start, so weâ€™ll go into partnership, and what are we going
NA
Then Razumihin began to unfold his project, and he explained at length
that almost all our publishers and booksellers know nothing at all
of what they are selling, and for that reason they are usually bad
publishers, and that any decent publications pay as a rule and give
a profit, sometimes a considerable one. Razumihin had, indeed, been
dreaming of setting up as a publisher. For the last two years he had
been working in publishersâ€™ offices, and knew three European languages
well, though he had told Raskolnikov six days before that he was

there will be a lot of work, but we will work, you, Avdotya Romanovna,
I, Rodion.... You get a splendid profit on some books nowadays! And
the great point of the business is that we shall know just what wants
translating, and we shall be translating, publishing, learning all at
once. I can be of use because I have experience. For nearly two years
Iâ€™ve been scuttling about among the publishers, and now I know every
detail of their business. You need not be a saint to make pots, believe

the secret--two or three books which one might get a hundred roubles
simply for thinking of translating and publishing. Indeed, and I would
not take five hundred for the very idea of one of them. And what do you
think? If I were to tell a publisher, I dare say heâ€™d hesitate--they are
such blockheads! And as for the business side, printing, paper, selling,
you trust to me, I know my way about. Weâ€™ll begin in a small way and go

It was dark in the corridor, they were standing near the lamp. For a
minute they were looking at one another in silence. Razumihin remembered
that minute all his life. Raskolnikovâ€™s burning and intent eyes
grew more penetrating every moment, piercing into his soul, into his
consciousness. Suddenly Razumihin started. Something strange, as it
were, passed between them.... Some idea, some hint, as it were, slipped,
something awful, hideous, and suddenly understood on both sides....

I will not attempt to describe how Razumihin went back to the ladies,
how he soothed them, how he protested that Rodya needed rest in his
illness, protested that Rodya was sure to come, that he would come every
day, that he was very, very much upset, that he must not be irritated,
that he, Razumihin, would watch over him, would get him a doctor, the
best doctor, a consultation.... In fact from that evening Razumihin took
his place with them as a son and a brother.
CHAPTER IV
Raskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where Sonia
lived. It was an old green house of three storeys. He found the
porter and obtained from him vague directions as to the whereabouts of
Kapernaumov, the tailor. Having found in the corner of the courtyard
the entrance to the dark and narrow staircase, he mounted to the second
floor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole second storey
over the yard. While he was wandering in the darkness, uncertain where
to turn for Kapernaumovâ€™s door, a door opened three paces from him; he
mechanically took hold of it.

On a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper candlestick.

NA
her, hastened in.
A minute later Sonia, too, came in with the candle, set down the
candlestick and, completely disconcerted, stood before him inexpressibly
agitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit. The colour
rushed suddenly to her pale face and tears came into her eyes... She
felt sick and ashamed and happy, too.... Raskolnikov turned away quickly
and sat on a chair by the table. He scanned the room in a rapid glance.
It was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room, the only one let by the
Kapernaumovs, to whose rooms a closed door led in the wall on the left.
In the opposite side on the right hand wall was another door, always
kept locked. That led to the next flat, which formed a separate lodging.
Soniaâ€™s room looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle and
this gave it a grotesque appearance. A wall with three windows looking
out on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute
angle, and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light.
The other corner was disproportionately obtuse. There was scarcely any
furniture in the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead,
beside it, nearest the door, a chair. A plain, deal table covered by a
blue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the door into the other
flat. Two rush-bottom chairs stood by the table. On the opposite
wall near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawers
looking, as it were, lost in a desert. That was all there was in the
room. The yellow, scratched and shabby wall-paper was black in the
corners. It must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter. There
was every sign of poverty; even the bedstead had no curtain.
Sonia looked in silence at her visitor, who was so attentively and
unceremoniously scrutinising her room, and even began at last to tremble
with terror, as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiter
of her destinies.

â€œYes.... He stammers and heâ€™s lame. And his wife, too.... Itâ€™s not
exactly that she stammers, but she canâ€™t speak plainly. She is a very
kind woman. And he used to be a house serf. And there are seven
children... and itâ€™s only the eldest one that stammers and the others
are simply ill... but they donâ€™t stammer.... But where did you hear

Sonia said this as though in despair, wringing her hands in excitement
and distress. Her pale cheeks flushed, there was a look of anguish in
her eyes. It was clear that she was stirred to the very depths, that
she was longing to speak, to champion, to express something. A sort
of _insatiable_ compassion, if one may so express it, was reflected in
every feature of her face.
â€œBeat me! how can you? Good heavens, beat me! And if she did beat me,
what then? What of it? You know nothing, nothing about it.... She is so
unhappy... ah, how unhappy! And ill.... She is seeking righteousness,
she is pure. She has such faith that there must be righteousness
everywhere and she expects it.... And if you were to torture her, she
wouldnâ€™t do wrong. She doesnâ€™t see that itâ€™s impossible for people to
be righteous and she is angry at it. Like a child, like a child. She is

NA
Sonia looked at him inquiringly.
â€œThey are left on your hands, you see. They were all on your hands
before, though.... And your father came to you to beg for drink. Well,

NA
NA
â€œI donâ€™t know.... They are in debt for the lodging, but the landlady,
I hear, said to-day that she wanted to get rid of them, and Katerina
NA
NA
NA
was agitated again and even angry, as though a canary or some other
little bird were to be angry. â€œAnd what could she do? What, what could
NA
to-day! Her mind is unhinged, havenâ€™t you noticed it? At one minute she
is worrying like a child that everything should be right to-morrow, the
lunch and all that.... Then she is wringing her hands, spitting blood,
weeping, and all at once she will begin knocking her head against the
wall, in despair. Then she will be comforted again. She builds all her
hopes on you; she says that you will help her now and that she will
borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and
set up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to
superintend it, and we will begin a new splendid life. And she kisses
and hugs me, comforts me, and you know she has such faith, such faith in
her fancies! One canâ€™t contradict her. And all the day long she has been
washing, cleaning, mending. She dragged the wash tub into the room with
her feeble hands and sank on the bed, gasping for breath. We went this
morning to the shops to buy shoes for Polenka and Lida for theirs are
quite worn out. Only the money weâ€™d reckoned wasnâ€™t enough, not nearly
enough. And she picked out such dear little boots, for she has taste,
you donâ€™t know. And there in the shop she burst out crying before the

said with a bitter smile.

again. â€œWhy, I know, you gave your last penny yourself, though youâ€™d
seen nothing of it, and if youâ€™d seen everything, oh dear! And how
often, how often Iâ€™ve brought her to tears! Only last week! Yes, I! Only
a week before his death. I was cruel! And how often Iâ€™ve done it! Ah,
NA
Sonia wrung her hands as she spoke at the pain of remembering it.

â€˜read me something, Sonia, my head aches, read to me, hereâ€™s a book.â€™ He
had a book he had got from Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, he lives
there, he always used to get hold of such funny books. And I said, â€˜I
canâ€™t stay,â€™ as I didnâ€™t want to read, and Iâ€™d gone in chiefly to show
Katerina Ivanovna some collars. Lizaveta, the pedlar, sold me some
collars and cuffs cheap, pretty, new, embroidered ones. Katerina
Ivanovna liked them very much; she put them on and looked at herself
in the glass and was delighted with them. â€˜Make me a present of them,
Sonia,â€™ she said, â€˜please do.â€™ â€˜_Please do_,â€™ she said, she wanted them
so much. And when could she wear them? They just reminded her of her old
happy days. She looked at herself in the glass, admired herself, and she
has no clothes at all, no things of her own, hasnâ€™t had all these years!
And she never asks anyone for anything; she is proud, sheâ€™d sooner give
away everything. And these she asked for, she liked them so much. And I
was sorry to give them. â€˜What use are they to you, Katerina Ivanovna?â€™ I
said. I spoke like that to her, I ought not to have said that! She gave
me such a look. And she was so grieved, so grieved at my refusing her.
And it was so sad to see.... And she was not grieved for the collars,
but for my refusing, I saw that. Ah, if only I could bring it all back,

It was evident that that idea had very often occurred to her before and
he had only roused it again.

And Soniaâ€™s face worked with awful terror.

against some wall, as she did to-day, and the children will cry....
Then she will fall down, be taken to the police station and to the
NA
NA
overburdened bosom.
She listened, looking imploringly at him, clasping her hands in dumb
entreaty, as though it all depended upon him.
Raskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room. A minute passed.
Sonia was standing with her hands and her head hanging in terrible
dejection.

And again he paced the room. Another minute passed.

Sonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed into her face again.

Soniaâ€™s face suddenly changed; a tremor passed over it. She looked at
him with unutterable reproach, tried to say something, but could not
speak and broke into bitter, bitter sobs, hiding her face in her hands.
â€œYou say Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s mind is unhinged; your own mind is

Five minutes passed. He still paced up and down the room in silence, not
looking at her. At last he went up to her; his eyes glittered. He put
his two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful
face. His eyes were hard, feverish and piercing, his lips were
twitching. All at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the
ground, kissed her foot. Sonia drew back from him as from a madman. And
certainly he looked like a madman.
NA
anguish clutched at her heart.
He stood up at once.

added, turning to her a minute later. â€œI said just now to an insolent

in you side by side with other, opposite, holy feelings? It would be
better, a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and end

NA
eyes of anguish, but not seeming surprised at his suggestion.
Raskolnikov looked strangely at her. He read it all in her face; so she
must have had that thought already, perhaps many times, and earnestly
she had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestly, that
now she scarcely wondered at his suggestion. She had not even noticed
the cruelty of his words. (The significance of his reproaches and his
peculiar attitude to her shame she had, of course, not noticed either,
and that, too, was clear to him.) But he saw how monstrously the thought
of her disgraceful, shameful position was torturing her and had long
NA
NA
little orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna,
knocking her head against the wall in her consumption, meant for Sonia.
But, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that with her character and
the amount of education she had after all received, she could not in any
case remain so. He was still confronted by the question, how could she
have remained so long in that position without going out of her mind,
since she could not bring herself to jump into the water? Of course he
knew that Soniaâ€™s position was an exceptional case, though unhappily not
unique and not infrequent, indeed; but that very exceptionalness, her
tinge of education, her previous life might, one would have thought,
have killed her at the first step on that revolting path. What held her
up--surely not depravity? All that infamy had obviously only touched
her mechanically, not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her
heart; he saw that. He saw through her as she stood before him....

He stayed obstinately at that thought. He liked that explanation indeed
better than any other. He began looking more intently at her.

Sonia did not speak; he stood beside her waiting for an answer.

Sonia was silent a long while, as though she could not answer. Her weak

her with eager curiosity, with a new, strange, almost morbid feeling.
He gazed at that pale, thin, irregular, angular little face, those soft
blue eyes, which could flash with such fire, such stern energy, that
little body still shaking with indignation and anger--and it all seemed
to him more and more strange, almost impossible. â€œShe is a religious

There was a book lying on the chest of drawers. He had noticed it every

The last phrase sounded strange in his ears. And here was something new
again: the mysterious meetings with Lizaveta and both of them--religious
maniacs.
NA
NA
Sonia still hesitated. Her heart was throbbing. She hardly dared to read
NA
NA
breathlessly.
NA
Sonia opened the book and found the place. Her hands were shaking, her
voice failed her. Twice she tried to begin and could not bring out the
first syllable.
NA
herself at last to read, but at the third word her voice broke like an
overstrained string. There was a catch in her breath.
Raskolnikov saw in part why Sonia could not bring herself to read to him
and the more he saw this, the more roughly and irritably he insisted on
her doing so. He understood only too well how painful it was for her
to betray and unveil all that was her _own_. He understood that these
feelings really were her _secret treasure_, which she had kept perhaps
for years, perhaps from childhood, while she lived with an unhappy
father and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief, in the midst of
starving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches. But at the same
time he knew now and knew for certain that, although it filled her with
dread and suffering, yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to read
to _him_ that he might hear it, and to read _now_ whatever might come of
it!... He read this in her eyes, he could see it in her intense emotion.
She mastered herself, controlled the spasm in her throat and went on
reading the eleventh chapter of St. John. She went on to the nineteenth
verse:
â€œAnd many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning
their brother.
â€œThen Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met
Him: but Mary sat still in the house.
â€œThen said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother
had not died.
â€œBut I know that even now whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will give

Then she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that her voice would
quiver and break again.
â€œJesus said unto her, thy brother shall rise again.
â€œMartha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again in the
resurrection, at the last day.
â€œJesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that
believeth in Me though he were dead, yet shall he live.
â€œAnd whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest
thou this?
NA
(And drawing a painful breath, Sonia read distinctly and forcibly as
though she were making a public confession of faith.)
â€œYea, Lord: I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God Which

She stopped and looked up quickly at him, but controlling herself went
on reading. Raskolnikov sat without moving, his elbows on the table and
his eyes turned away. She read to the thirty-second verse.
â€œThen when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell down at
His feet, saying unto Him, Lord if Thou hadst been here, my brother had
not died.
â€œWhen Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which
came with her, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled,
â€œAnd said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto Him, Lord, come and
see.
â€œJesus wept.
â€œThen said the Jews, behold how He loved him!
â€œAnd some of them said, could not this Man which opened the eyes of the

Raskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion. Yes, he had known it!
She was trembling in a real physical fever. He had expected it. She was
getting near the story of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense
triumph came over her. Her voice rang out like a bell; triumph and joy
gave it power. The lines danced before her eyes, but she knew what she
was reading by heart. At the last verse â€œCould not this Man which opened

the doubt, the reproach and censure of the blind disbelieving Jews, who
in another moment would fall at His feet as though struck by
thunder, sobbing and believing.... â€œAnd _he, he_--too, is blinded and

anticipation.
â€œJesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the grave. It was a
cave, and a stone lay upon it.
â€œJesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was

She laid emphasis on the word _four_.
â€œJesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest
believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
â€œThen they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid.
And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank Thee that Thou
hast heard Me.
â€œAnd I knew that Thou hearest Me always; but because of the people which
stand by I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.
â€œAnd when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come

seeing it before her eyes.)

abruptly, and turning away she stood motionless, not daring to raise
her eyes to him. She still trembled feverishly. The candle-end was
flickering out in the battered candlestick, dimly lighting up in the
poverty-stricken room the murderer and the harlot who had so strangely
been reading together the eternal book. Five minutes or more passed.

agitated by his words.
â€œWhat for? Because you canâ€™t remain like this, thatâ€™s why! You must look
things straight in the face at last, and not weep like a child and cry
that God wonâ€™t allow it. What will happen, if you should really be taken
to the hospital to-morrow? She is mad and in consumption, sheâ€™ll soon
die and the children? Do you mean to tell me Polenka wonâ€™t come to
grief? Havenâ€™t you seen children here at the street corners sent out
by their mothers to beg? Iâ€™ve found out where those mothers live and in
what surroundings. Children canâ€™t remain children there! At seven the
child is vicious and a thief. Yet children, you know, are the image of

â€œWhatâ€™s to be done? Break what must be broken, once for all, thatâ€™s all,

trembling creation and all the ant-heap!... Thatâ€™s the goal, remember
that! Thatâ€™s my farewell message. Perhaps itâ€™s the last time I shall
speak to you. If I donâ€™t come to-morrow, youâ€™ll hear of it all, and then

looking wildly at him.
â€œI know and will tell... you, only you. I have chosen you out. Iâ€™m not
coming to you to ask forgiveness, but simply to tell you. I chose you
out long ago to hear this, when your father talked of you and when
Lizaveta was alive, I thought of it. Good-bye, donâ€™t shake hands.

one insane and felt it. Her head was going round.

Sonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious. She jumped up from
time to time, wept and wrung her hands, then sank again into feverish
sleep and dreamt of Polenka, Katerina Ivanovna and Lizaveta, of reading
the gospel and him... him with pale face, with burning eyes... kissing
her feet, weeping.
On the other side of the door on the right, which divided Soniaâ€™s room
from Madame Resslichâ€™s flat, was a room which had long stood empty. A
card was fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the windows over the
canal advertising it to let. Sonia had long been accustomed to the
roomâ€™s being uninhabited. But all that time Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov had been
standing, listening at the door of the empty room. When Raskolnikov went
out he stood still, thought a moment, went on tiptoe to his own room
which adjoined the empty one, brought a chair and noiselessly carried it
to the door that led to Soniaâ€™s room. The conversation had struck him
as interesting and remarkable, and he had greatly enjoyed it--so much so
that he brought a chair that he might not in the future, to-morrow, for
instance, have to endure the inconvenience of standing a whole hour, but
might listen in comfort.
CHAPTER V
When next morning at eleven oâ€™clock punctually Raskolnikov went into the
department of the investigation of criminal causes and sent his name in
to Porfiry Petrovitch, he was surprised at being kept waiting so long:
it was at least ten minutes before he was summoned. He had expected
that they would pounce upon him. But he stood in the waiting-room, and
people, who apparently had nothing to do with him, were continually
passing to and fro before him. In the next room which looked like an
office, several clerks were sitting writing and obviously they had
no notion who or what Raskolnikov might be. He looked uneasily and
suspiciously about him to see whether there was not some guard, some
mysterious watch being kept on him to prevent his escape. But there was
nothing of the sort: he saw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty
details, then other people, no one seemed to have any concern with him.
He might go where he liked for them. The conviction grew stronger in him
that if that enigmatic man of yesterday, that phantom sprung out of the
earth, had seen everything, they would not have let him stand and wait
like that. And would they have waited till he elected to appear at
eleven? Either the man had not yet given information, or... or simply
he knew nothing, had seen nothing (and how could he have seen anything?)
and so all that had happened to him the day before was again a phantom
exaggerated by his sick and overstrained imagination. This conjecture
had begun to grow strong the day before, in the midst of all his
alarm and despair. Thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh
conflict, he was suddenly aware that he was trembling--and he felt a
rush of indignation at the thought that he was trembling with fear at
facing that hateful Porfiry Petrovitch. What he dreaded above all was
meeting that man again; he hated him with an intense, unmitigated hatred
and was afraid his hatred might betray him. His indignation was such
that he ceased trembling at once; he made ready to go in with a cold and
arrogant bearing and vowed to himself to keep as silent as possible,
to watch and listen and for once at least to control his overstrained
nerves. At that moment he was summoned to Porfiry Petrovitch.
He found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his study. His study was a room
neither large nor small, furnished with a large writing-table, that
stood before a sofa, upholstered in checked material, a bureau, a
bookcase in the corner and several chairs--all government furniture,
of polished yellow wood. In the further wall there was a closed door,
beyond it there were no doubt other rooms. On Raskolnikovâ€™s entrance
Porfiry Petrovitch had at once closed the door by which he had come in
and they remained alone. He met his visitor with an apparently genial
and good-tempered air, and it was only after a few minutes that
Raskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him, as though he had
been thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something very secret.

holding out both hands to him. â€œCome, sit down, old man... or perhaps
you donâ€™t like to be called â€˜my dear fellowâ€™ and â€˜old man!â€™--_tout

 the apologies for familiarity, the French phrase _tout court_, were all
characteristic signs.
â€œHe held out both hands to me, but he did not give me one--he drew it

but when their eyes met, quick as lightning they looked away.
â€œI brought you this paper... about the watch. Here it is. Is it all

Petrovitch said as though in haste, and after he had said it he took the

A minute later when he was talking of something else he took it from the
table and put it on his bureau.
â€œI believe you said yesterday you would like to question me...

his mind in a flash. â€œWhy am I so uneasy at having put in that â€˜_I

uneasiness at the mere contact with Porfiry, at the first words, at the
first looks, had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions, and that
this was fearfully dangerous. His nerves were quivering, his emotion was

NA
Petrovitch, moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim,
as it were making dashes towards the window, the bureau and the table,
at one moment avoiding Raskolnikovâ€™s suspicious glance, then again
standing still and looking him straight in the face.
His fat round little figure looked very strange, like a ball rolling
from one side to the other and rebounding back.
â€œWeâ€™ve plenty of time. Do you smoke? have you your own? Here, a

government quarters. But I am living outside for the time, I had to
have some repairs done here. Itâ€™s almost finished now.... Government

though he had just thought of something quite different. â€œYes, a capital

stopping short two steps from him.
This stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the
serious, brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor.
But this stirred Raskolnikovâ€™s spleen more than ever and he could not
resist an ironical and rather incautious challenge.
NA
and taking a kind of pleasure in his own insolence. â€œI believe itâ€™s a
sort of legal rule, a sort of legal tradition--for all investigating
lawyers--to begin their attack from afar, with a trivial, or at least
an irrelevant subject, so as to encourage, or rather, to divert the man
they are cross-examining, to disarm his caution and then all at once to
give him an unexpected knock-down blow with some fatal question. Isnâ€™t
that so? Itâ€™s a sacred tradition, mentioned, I fancy, in all the manuals
NA
â€œYes, yes.... Why, do you imagine that was why I spoke about government
NA
And as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch screwed up his eyes and winked;
a good-humoured, crafty look passed over his face. The wrinkles on his
forehead were smoothed out, his eyes contracted, his features broadened
and he suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh, shaking all
over and looking Raskolnikov straight in the face. The latter forced
himself to laugh, too, but when Porfiry, seeing that he was laughing,
broke into such a guffaw that he turned almost crimson, Raskolnikovâ€™s
repulsion overcame all precaution; he left off laughing, scowled and
stared with hatred at Porfiry, keeping his eyes fixed on him while his
intentionally prolonged laughter lasted. There was lack of precaution on
both sides, however, for Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be laughing in
his visitorâ€™s face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with
which the visitor received it. The latter fact was very significant
in Raskolnikovâ€™s eyes: he saw that Porfiry Petrovitch had not been
embarrassed just before either, but that he, Raskolnikov, had perhaps
fallen into a trap; that there must be something, some motive here
unknown to him; that, perhaps, everything was in readiness and in
another moment would break upon him...
He went straight to the point at once, rose from his seat and took his
cap.

me to withdraw. I have no time to spare.... I have to be at the funeral

feeling angry at once at having made this addition and more irritated at
his anger. â€œI am sick of it all, do you hear? and have long been. Itâ€™s

about his illness was still more out of place, â€œin short, kindly examine
me or let me go, at once. And if you must examine me, do so in the
proper form! I will not allow you to do so otherwise, and so meanwhile,
NA
NA
 cackled Porfiry Petrovitch with a change of tone, instantly leaving off
NA
to place and fussily making Raskolnikov sit down. â€œThereâ€™s no hurry,
thereâ€™s no hurry, itâ€™s all nonsense. Oh, no, Iâ€™m very glad youâ€™ve come
to see me at last... I look upon you simply as a visitor. And as for
my confounded laughter, please excuse it, Rodion Romanovitch. Rodion
Romanovitch? That is your name?... Itâ€™s my nerves, you tickled me
so with your witty observation; I assure you, sometimes I shake with
laughter like an india-rubber ball for half an hour at a time.... Iâ€™m
often afraid of an attack of paralysis. Do sit down. Please do, or I
NA
Raskolnikov did not speak; he listened, watching him, still frowning
angrily. He did sit down, but still held his cap.
NA
 Porfiry Petrovitch continued, moving about the room and again avoiding
his visitorâ€™s eyes. â€œYou see, Iâ€™m a bachelor, a man of no consequence
and not used to society; besides, I have nothing before me, Iâ€™m set, Iâ€™m
running to seed and... and have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that in
our Petersburg circles, if two clever men meet who are not intimate, but
respect each other, like you and me, it takes them half an hour before
they can find a subject for conversation--they are dumb, they sit
opposite each other and feel awkward. Everyone has subjects of
conversation, ladies for instance... people in high society always have
their subjects of conversation, _câ€™est de rigueur_, but people of the
middle sort like us, thinking people that is, are always tongue-tied
and awkward. What is the reason of it? Whether it is the lack of public
interest, or whether it is we are so honest we donâ€™t want to deceive one
another, I donâ€™t know. What do you think? Do put down your cap, it
looks as if you were just going, it makes me uncomfortable... I am so
NA
Raskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening in silence with
a serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of Porfiry
Petrovitch. â€œDoes he really want to distract my attention with his silly

â€œI canâ€™t offer you coffee here; but why not spend five minutes with a

fellow, I am very much afraid of offending you, but exercise is
absolutely indispensable for me. Iâ€™m always sitting and so glad to be
moving about for five minutes... I suffer from my sedentary life... I
always intend to join a gymnasium; they say that officials of all ranks,
even Privy Councillors, may be seen skipping gaily there; there you have
it, modern science... yes, yes.... But as for my duties here, inquiries
and all such formalities... you mentioned inquiries yourself just now...
I assure you these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for
the interrogator than for the interrogated.... You made the observation

observation of the kind.) â€œOne gets into a muddle! A regular muddle! One
keeps harping on the same note, like a drum! There is to be a reform and
we shall be called by a different name, at least, he-he-he! And as for
our legal tradition, as you so wittily called it, I thoroughly agree
with you. Every prisoner on trial, even the rudest peasant, knows that
they begin by disarming him with irrelevant questions (as you so happily
put it) and then deal him a knock-down blow, he-he-he!--your felicitous
comparison, he-he! So you really imagined that I meant by â€˜government
quartersâ€™... he-he! You are an ironical person. Come. I wonâ€™t go on! Ah,
by the way, yes! One word leads to another. You spoke of formality just
now, apropos of the inquiry, you know. But whatâ€™s the use of formality?
In many cases itâ€™s nonsense. Sometimes one has a friendly chat and gets
a good deal more out of it. One can always fall back on formality, allow
me to assure you. And after all, what does it amount to? An examining
lawyer cannot be bounded by formality at every step. The work of

Porfiry Petrovitch took breath a moment. He had simply babbled on
uttering empty phrases, letting slip a few enigmatic words and again
reverting to incoherence. He was almost running about the room, moving
his fat little legs quicker and quicker, looking at the ground, with his
right hand behind his back, while with his left making gesticulations
that were extraordinarily incongruous with his words. Raskolnikov
suddenly noticed that as he ran about the room he seemed twice to stop
for a moment near the door, as though he were listening.
NA
NA
with extraordinary simplicity at Raskolnikov (which startled him and
instantly put him on his guard); â€œcertainly quite right in laughing so
wittily at our legal forms, he-he! Some of these elaborate psychological
methods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless, if one adheres
too closely to the forms. Yes... I am talking of forms again. Well, if
I recognise, or more strictly speaking, if I suspect someone or other to
be a criminal in any case entrusted to me... youâ€™re reading for the law,
NA
NA
â€œWell, then it is a precedent for you for the future--though donâ€™t
suppose I should venture to instruct you after the articles you publish
about crime! No, I simply make bold to state it by way of fact, if I
took this man or that for a criminal, why, I ask, should I worry him
prematurely, even though I had evidence against him? In one case I may
be bound, for instance, to arrest a man at once, but another may be in
quite a different position, you know, so why shouldnâ€™t I let him walk
about the town a bit? he-he-he! But I see you donâ€™t quite understand, so
Iâ€™ll give you a clearer example. If I put him in prison too soon, I
may very likely give him, so to speak, moral support, he-he! Youâ€™re
NA
Raskolnikov had no idea of laughing. He was sitting with compressed
lips, his feverish eyes fixed on Porfiry Petrovitchâ€™s.
â€œYet that is the case, with some types especially, for men are so
different. You say â€˜evidenceâ€™. Well, there may be evidence. But
evidence, you know, can generally be taken two ways. I am an examining
lawyer and a weak man, I confess it. I should like to make a proof, so
to say, mathematically clear. I should like to make a chain of evidence
such as twice two are four, it ought to be a direct, irrefutable proof!
And if I shut him up too soon--even though I might be convinced _he_
was the man, I should very likely be depriving myself of the means of
getting further evidence against him. And how? By giving him, so to
speak, a definite position, I shall put him out of suspense and set his
mind at rest, so that he will retreat into his shell. They say that at
Sevastopol, soon after Alma, the clever people were in a terrible fright
that the enemy would attack openly and take Sevastopol at once. But when
they saw that the enemy preferred a regular siege, they were delighted,
I am told and reassured, for the thing would drag on for two months at
least. Youâ€™re laughing, you donâ€™t believe me again? Of course, youâ€™re
right, too. Youâ€™re right, youâ€™re right. These are special cases, I
admit. But you must observe this, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, the
general case, the case for which all legal forms and rules are intended,
for which they are calculated and laid down in books, does not exist at
all, for the reason that every case, every crime, for instance, so soon
as it actually occurs, at once becomes a thoroughly special case and
sometimes a case unlike any thatâ€™s gone before. Very comic cases of that
sort sometimes occur. If I leave one man quite alone, if I donâ€™t touch
him and donâ€™t worry him, but let him know or at least suspect every
moment that I know all about it and am watching him day and night, and
if he is in continual suspicion and terror, heâ€™ll be bound to lose his
head. Heâ€™ll come of himself, or maybe do something which will make it as
plain as twice two are four--itâ€™s delightful. It may be so with a simple
peasant, but with one of our sort, an intelligent man cultivated on a
certain side, itâ€™s a dead certainty. For, my dear fellow, itâ€™s a very
important matter to know on what side a man is cultivated. And then
there are nerves, there are nerves, you have overlooked them! Why, they
are all sick, nervous and irritable!... And then how they all suffer
from spleen! That I assure you is a regular gold-mine for us. And itâ€™s
no anxiety to me, his running about the town free! Let him, let him walk
about for a bit! I know well enough that Iâ€™ve caught him and that he
wonâ€™t escape me. Where could he escape to, he-he? Abroad, perhaps? A
Pole will escape abroad, but not here, especially as I am watching
and have taken measures. Will he escape into the depths of the country
perhaps? But you know, peasants live there, real rude Russian peasants.
A modern cultivated man would prefer prison to living with such
strangers as our peasants. He-he! But thatâ€™s all nonsense, and on
the surface. Itâ€™s not merely that he has nowhere to run to, he is
_psychologically_ unable to escape me, he-he! What an expression!
Through a law of nature he canâ€™t escape me if he had anywhere to go.
Have you seen a butterfly round a candle? Thatâ€™s how he will keep
circling and circling round me. Freedom will lose its attractions. Heâ€™ll
begin to brood, heâ€™ll weave a tangle round himself, heâ€™ll worry himself
to death! Whatâ€™s more he will provide me with a mathematical proof--if I
only give him long enough interval.... And heâ€™ll keep circling round
me, getting nearer and nearer and then--flop! Heâ€™ll fly straight into my
mouth and Iâ€™ll swallow him, and that will be very amusing, he-he-he! You
NA
Raskolnikov made no reply; he sat pale and motionless, still gazing with
the same intensity into Porfiryâ€™s face.
NA
playing with a mouse, like yesterday. He canâ€™t be showing off his power
with no motive... prompting me; he is far too clever for that... he must
have another object. What is it? Itâ€™s all nonsense, my friend, you are
pretending, to scare me! Youâ€™ve no proofs and the man I saw had no
real existence. You simply want to make me lose my head, to work me up
beforehand and so to crush me. But you are wrong, you wonâ€™t do it! But
why give me such a hint? Is he reckoning on my shattered nerves? No, my
friend, you are wrong, you wonâ€™t do it even though you have some trap
NA
And he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown ordeal. At times
he longed to fall on Porfiry and strangle him. This anger was what he
dreaded from the beginning. He felt that his parched lips were flecked
with foam, his heart was throbbing. But he was still determined not to
speak till the right moment. He realised that this was the best
policy in his position, because instead of saying too much he would be
irritating his enemy by his silence and provoking him into speaking too
freely. Anyhow, this was what he hoped for.
â€œNo, I see you donâ€™t believe me, you think I am playing a harmless joke
NA
at every instant and again pacing round the room. â€œAnd to be sure youâ€™re
right: God has given me a figure that can awaken none but comic ideas in
other people; a buffoon; but let me tell you, and I repeat it, excuse
an old man, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, you are a man still young, so to
say, in your first youth and so you put intellect above everything, like
all young people. Playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you and
thatâ€™s for all the world like the old Austrian _Hof-kriegsrath_, as
far as I can judge of military matters, that is: on paper theyâ€™d beaten
Napoleon and taken him prisoner, and there in their study they worked it
all out in the cleverest fashion, but look you, General Mack surrendered
with all his army, he-he-he! I see, I see, Rodion Romanovitch, you are
laughing at a civilian like me, taking examples out of military history!
But I canâ€™t help it, itâ€™s my weakness. I am fond of military science.
And Iâ€™m ever so fond of reading all military histories. Iâ€™ve certainly
missed my proper career. I ought to have been in the army, upon my
word I ought. I shouldnâ€™t have been a Napoleon, but I might have been a
major, he-he! Well, Iâ€™ll tell you the whole truth, my dear fellow, about
this _special case_, I mean: actual fact and a manâ€™s temperament, my
dear sir, are weighty matters and itâ€™s astonishing how they sometimes
deceive the sharpest calculation! I--listen to an old man--am speaking
NA
was scarcely five-and-thirty, actually seemed to have grown old; even
his voice changed and he seemed to shrink together) â€œMoreover, Iâ€™m
a candid man... am I a candid man or not? What do you say? I fancy I
really am: I tell you these things for nothing and donâ€™t even expect a
reward for it, he-he! Well, to proceed, wit in my opinion is a splendid
thing, it is, so to say, an adornment of nature and a consolation of
life, and what tricks it can play! So that it sometimes is hard for a
poor examining lawyer to know where he is, especially when heâ€™s liable
to be carried away by his own fancy, too, for you know he is a man after
all! But the poor fellow is saved by the criminalâ€™s temperament, worse
luck for him! But young people carried away by their own wit donâ€™t think
of that â€˜when they overstep all obstacles,â€™ as you wittily and cleverly
expressed it yesterday. He will lie--that is, the man who is a _special
case_, the incognito, and he will lie well, in the cleverest fashion;
you might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of his wit, but at
the most interesting, the most flagrant moment he will faint. Of course
there may be illness and a stuffy room as well, but anyway! Anyway heâ€™s
given us the idea! He lied incomparably, but he didnâ€™t reckon on his
temperament. Thatâ€™s what betrays him! Another time he will be carried
away by his playful wit into making fun of the man who suspects him, he
will turn pale as it were on purpose to mislead, but his paleness will
be _too natural_, too much like the real thing, again he has given us
an idea! Though his questioner may be deceived at first, he will think
differently next day if he is not a fool, and, of course, it is like
that at every step! He puts himself forward where he is not wanted,
speaks continually when he ought to keep silent, brings in all sorts of
allegorical allusions, he-he! Comes and asks why didnâ€™t you take me long
ago? he-he-he! And that can happen, you know, with the cleverest man,
the psychologist, the literary man. The temperament reflects everything
like a mirror! Gaze into it and admire what you see! But why are you so

Porfiry stood facing him, paused a moment and suddenly he too laughed.
Raskolnikov got up from the sofa, abruptly checking his hysterical
laughter.
NA
his legs trembled and he could scarcely stand. â€œI see clearly at last
that you actually suspect me of murdering that old woman and her sister
Lizaveta. Let me tell you for my part that I am sick of this. If you
find that you have a right to prosecute me legally, to arrest me, then
prosecute me, arrest me. But I will not let myself be jeered at to my

â€œSome fresh air! And you must have some water, my dear fellow. Youâ€™re

Porfiry Petrovitchâ€™s alarm and sympathy were so natural that Raskolnikov
was silent and began looking at him with wild curiosity. He did not take
the water, however.

He forced him to take the glass. Raskolnikov raised it mechanically to
his lips, but set it on the table again with disgust.
â€œYes, youâ€™ve had a little attack! Youâ€™ll bring back your illness again,
NA
though he still looked rather disconcerted. â€œGood heavens, you must
take more care of yourself! Dmitri Prokofitch was here, came to see me
yesterday--I know, I know, Iâ€™ve a nasty, ironical temper, but what they
made of it!... Good heavens, he came yesterday after youâ€™d been. We
dined and he talked and talked away, and I could only throw up my hands
in despair! Did he come from you? But do sit down, for mercyâ€™s sake, sit
NA
NA
 Raskolnikov answered sharply.
NA
NA
â€œWhy this, Rodion Romanovitch, that I know more than that about you;
I know about everything. I know how you went _to take a flat_ at night
when it was dark and how you rang the bell and asked about the blood, so
that the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it. Yes, I
understand your state of mind at that time... but youâ€™ll drive yourself
mad like that, upon my word! Youâ€™ll lose your head! Youâ€™re full of
generous indignation at the wrongs youâ€™ve received, first from destiny,
and then from the police officers, and so you rush from one thing to
another to force them to speak out and make an end of it all, because
you are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness. Thatâ€™s so, isnâ€™t
it? I have guessed how you feel, havenâ€™t I? Only in that way youâ€™ll
lose your head and Razumihinâ€™s, too; heâ€™s too _good_ a man for such
a position, you must know that. You are ill and he is good and your
illness is infectious for him... Iâ€™ll tell you about it when you are
more yourself.... But do sit down, for goodnessâ€™ sake. Please rest, you
NA
Raskolnikov sat down; he no longer shivered, he was hot all over. In
amazement he listened with strained attention to Porfiry Petrovitch who
still seemed frightened as he looked after him with friendly solicitude.
But he did not believe a word he said, though he felt a strange
inclination to believe. Porfiryâ€™s unexpected words about the flat had
NA
NA
â€œYes, in our legal practice there was a case almost exactly similar, a
NA
murder and how he kept it up! It was a regular hallucination; he brought
forward facts, he imposed upon everyone and why? He had been partly, but
only partly, unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he knew that
he had given the murderers the opportunity, he sank into dejection, it
got on his mind and turned his brain, he began imagining things and he
persuaded himself that he was the murderer. But at last the High Court
of Appeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and put under
proper care. Thanks to the Court of Appeal! Tut-tut-tut! Why, my dear
fellow, you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse
to work upon your nerves, to go ringing bells at night and asking about
blood! Iâ€™ve studied all this morbid psychology in my practice. A man
is sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry. Just the
same with bell-ringing.... Itâ€™s all illness, Rodion Romanovitch! You
have begun to neglect your illness. You should consult an experienced
doctor, whatâ€™s the good of that fat fellow? You are lightheaded! You

For a moment Raskolnikov felt everything going round.
NA
NA
to what a degree of fury it might drive him, feeling that that fury
might drive him mad.
NA
every faculty to penetrate Porfiryâ€™s game, â€œI was quite myself, do you
NA
â€œYes, I hear and understand. You said yesterday you were not delirious,
you were particularly emphatic about it! I understand all you can tell
me! A-ach!... Listen, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow. If you were
actually a criminal, or were somehow mixed up in this damnable business,
would you insist that you were not delirious but in full possession
of your faculties? And so emphatically and persistently? Would it be
possible? Quite impossible, to my thinking. If you had anything on
your conscience, you certainly ought to insist that you were delirious.
NA
There was a note of slyness in this inquiry. Raskolnikov drew back on
the sofa as Porfiry bent over him and stared in silent perplexity at
him.
â€œAnother thing about Razumihin--you certainly ought to have said that he
came of his own accord, to have concealed your part in it! But you donâ€™t

He still stared at him as he said this and again there was a light of
intense hatred in his eyes.

do believe me, you believe a quarter; Iâ€™ll soon make you believe the
whole, because I have a sincere liking for you and genuinely wish you

Raskolnikovâ€™s lips trembled.

â€œGood heavens! Why, I learnt it all from you yourself! You donâ€™t
notice that in your excitement you tell me and others everything. From
Razumihin, too, I learnt a number of interesting details yesterday. No,
you interrupted me, but I must tell you that, for all your wit, your
suspiciousness makes you lose the common-sense view of things. To return
to bell-ringing, for instance. I, an examining lawyer, have betrayed a
precious thing like that, a real fact (for it is a fact worth having),
and you see nothing in it! Why, if I had the slightest suspicion of you,
should I have acted like that? No, I should first have disarmed your
suspicions and not let you see I knew of that fact, should have diverted
your attention and suddenly have dealt you a knock-down blow (your
expression) saying: â€˜And what were you doing, sir, pray, at ten or
nearly eleven at the murdered womanâ€™s flat and why did you ring the bell
and why did you ask about blood? And why did you invite the porters
to go with you to the police station, to the lieutenant?â€™ Thatâ€™s how
I ought to have acted if I had a grain of suspicion of you. I ought to
have taken your evidence in due form, searched your lodging and perhaps
have arrested you, too... so I have no suspicion of you, since I have
not done that! But you canâ€™t look at it normally and you see nothing, I

Raskolnikov started so that Porfiry Petrovitch could not fail to
perceive it.

a good-humoured and ironical face, as though he were not in the least
concerned at Raskolnikovâ€™s opinion of him. â€œI am lying... but how did
I treat you just now, I, the examining lawyer? Prompting you and giving
you every means for your defence; illness, I said, delirium, injury,
melancholy and the police officers and all the rest of it? Ah! He-he-he!
Though, indeed, all those psychological means of defence are not very
reliable and cut both ways: illness, delirium, I donâ€™t remember--thatâ€™s
all right, but why, my good sir, in your illness and in your delirium
were you haunted by just those delusions and not by any others? There

not the look of old womanish good nature and alarm in his face. Now
he was peremptory, stern, frowning and for once laying aside all
mystification.
But this was only for an instant. Raskolnikov, bewildered, suddenly fell
into actual frenzy, but, strange to say, he again obeyed the command to
speak quietly, though he was in a perfect paroxysm of fury.

driven to even greater fury by the thought. â€œArrest me, search me, but

wanted to drive me to fury and then to knock me down with priests and

muttered, listening at the door through which a noise could be heard.

But at this moment a strange incident occurred, something so unexpected
that neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry Petrovitch could have looked for
such a conclusion to their interview.
CHAPTER VI
When he remembered the scene afterwards, this is how Raskolnikov saw it.
The noise behind the door increased, and suddenly the door was opened a
little.
NA
For an instant there was no answer, but it was evident that there were
several persons at the door, and that they were apparently pushing
somebody back.
NA
NA
â€œHe is not wanted! Take him away! Let him wait! Whatâ€™s he doing here?
NA
NA
Two seconds, not more, were spent in actual struggle, then someone gave
a violent shove, and then a man, very pale, strode into the room.
This manâ€™s appearance was at first sight very strange. He stared
straight before him, as though seeing nothing. There was a determined
gleam in his eyes; at the same time there was a deathly pallor in his
face, as though he were being led to the scaffold. His white lips were
faintly twitching.
He was dressed like a workman and was of medium height, very young,
slim, his hair cut in round crop, with thin spare features. The man whom
he had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing
him by the shoulder; he was a warder; but Nikolay pulled his arm away.
Several persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway. Some of them
tried to get in. All this took place almost instantaneously.
â€œGo away, itâ€™s too soon! Wait till you are sent for!... Why have you
NA
and as it were thrown out of his reckoning.
But Nikolay suddenly knelt down.
NA
NA
suddenly, rather breathless, but speaking fairly loudly.
For ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb;
even the warder stepped back, mechanically retreated to the door, and
stood immovable.
NA
stupefaction.
NA
NA
obviously bewildered.
Nikolay again was silent for a moment.
â€œAlyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna, I... killed... with
NA
He still remained on his knees. Porfiry Petrovitch stood for some
moments as though meditating, but suddenly roused himself and waved back
the uninvited spectators. They instantly vanished and closed the door.
Then he looked towards Raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner,
staring wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped short,
looked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and then again at Nikolay, and
seeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Nikolay did not understand the question.
NA
NA
â€œDonâ€™t be in a hurry about Mitka! A-ach! How was it you ran downstairs
NA
NA
hurriedly, as though he had prepared the answer.
NA
NA
on Raskolnikov again.
He was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a moment he had
forgotten Raskolnikov. He was a little taken aback.
NA
do; Iâ€™m afraid you must go... itâ€™s no good your staying... I will...
NA
And taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door.
NA
not yet fully grasped the situation, had regained his courage.
â€œYou did not expect it either, my friend. See how your hand is
NA
NA
NA
They were already at the door; Porfiry was impatient for Raskolnikov to
be gone.
NA
 Raskolnikov said, sarcastically.
â€œWhy, his teeth are chattering as he asks, he-he! You are an ironical
NA
NA
NA
As he walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed that many people
were looking at him. Among them he saw the two porters from _the_ house,
whom he had invited that night to the police station. They stood there
waiting. But he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of
Porfiry Petrovitch behind him. Turning round, he saw the latter running
after him, out of breath.
â€œOne word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, itâ€™s in Godâ€™s hands,
but as a matter of form there are some questions I shall have to ask
NA
And Porfiry stood still, facing him with a smile.
NA
He seemed to want to say something more, but could not speak out.
â€œYou must forgive me, Porfiry Petrovitch, for what has just passed... I
NA
that he felt irresistibly inclined to display his coolness.
NA
â€œI myself, too... I have a wicked temper, I admit it! But we shall meet
NA
NA
Raskolnikov.
NA
and he screwed up his eyes, looking earnestly at Raskolnikov. â€œNow
NA
NA
NA
NA
descend the stairs, but looked back again. â€œI should like to wish you
NA
NA
prick up his ears at this.
â€œWhy, how you must have been torturing and harassing that poor Nikolay
psychologically, after your fashion, till he confessed! You must have
been at him day and night, proving to him that he was the murderer, and
now that he has confessed, youâ€™ll begin vivisecting him again. â€˜You are
lying,â€™ youâ€™ll say. â€˜You are not the murderer! You canâ€™t be! Itâ€™s not
NA
â€œHe-he-he! You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just now that it was
NA
NA
â€œHe-he! You are quick-witted. You notice everything! Youâ€™ve really a
playful mind! And you always fasten on the comic side... he-he! They say
NA
NA
NA
NA
Raskolnikov walked straight home. He was so muddled and bewildered that
on getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa, trying to
collect his thoughts. He did not attempt to think about Nikolay; he
was stupefied; he felt that his confession was something inexplicable,
amazing--something beyond his understanding. But Nikolayâ€™s confession
was an actual fact. The consequences of this fact were clear to him at
once, its falsehood could not fail to be discovered, and then they
would be after him again. Till then, at least, he was free and must do
something for himself, for the danger was imminent.
But how imminent? His position gradually became clear to him.
Remembering, sketchily, the main outlines of his recent scene with
Porfiry, he could not help shuddering again with horror. Of course,
he did not yet know all Porfiryâ€™s aims, he could not see into all his
calculations. But he had already partly shown his hand, and no one knew
NA
him. A little more and he _might_ have given himself away completely,
circumstantially. Knowing his nervous temperament and from the first
glance seeing through him, Porfiry, though playing a bold game, was
bound to win. Thereâ€™s no denying that Raskolnikov had compromised
himself seriously, but no _facts_ had come to light as yet; there was
nothing positive. But was he taking a true view of the position? Wasnâ€™t
he mistaken? What had Porfiry been trying to get at? Had he really some
surprise prepared for him? And what was it? Had he really been expecting
something or not? How would they have parted if it had not been for the
unexpected appearance of Nikolay?
Porfiry had shown almost all his cards--of course, he had risked
something in showing them--and if he had really had anything up his
sleeve (Raskolnikov reflected), he would have shown that, too. What was
NA
concealed anything like a fact, a piece of positive evidence? His
yesterdayâ€™s visitor? What had become of him? Where was he to-day? If
Porfiry really had any evidence, it must be connected with him....
He sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden in
his hands. He was still shivering nervously. At last he got up, took his
cap, thought a minute, and went to the door.
He had a sort of presentiment that for to-day, at least, he might
consider himself out of danger. He had a sudden sense almost of joy; he
wanted to make haste to Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s. He would be too late for
the funeral, of course, but he would be in time for the memorial dinner,
and there at once he would see Sonia.
He stood still, thought a moment, and a suffering smile came for a
moment on to his lips.
NA
NA
But as he was about to open the door, it began opening of itself. He
started and moved back. The door opened gently and slowly, and there
suddenly appeared a figure--yesterdayâ€™s visitor _from underground_.
The man stood in the doorway, looked at Raskolnikov without speaking,
and took a step forward into the room. He was exactly the same as
yesterday; the same figure, the same dress, but there was a great change
in his face; he looked dejected and sighed deeply. If he had only put
his hand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he would have
looked exactly like a peasant woman.
NA
still silent, but suddenly he bowed down almost to the ground, touching
it with his finger.
NA
NA
NA
NA
They looked at one another.
â€œI was vexed. When you came, perhaps in drink, and bade the porters go
to the police station and asked about the blood, I was vexed that they
let you go and took you for drunken. I was so vexed that I lost my
sleep. And remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked for
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI was standing at the gate with them... donâ€™t you remember? We have
carried on our trade in that house for years past. We cure and prepare
NA
And the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway came
clearly before Raskolnikovâ€™s mind; he recollected that there had
been several people there besides the porters, women among them.
He remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to the
police-station. He could not recall the face of the speaker, and even
now he did not recognise it, but he remembered that he had turned round
and made him some answer....
So this was the solution of yesterdayâ€™s horror. The most awful thought
was that he had been actually almost lost, had almost done for himself
on account of such a _trivial_ circumstance. So this man could tell
nothing except his asking about the flat and the blood stains. So
Porfiry, too, had nothing but that _delirium_, no facts but this
_psychology_ which _cuts both ways_, nothing positive. So if no more
facts come to light (and they must not, they must not!) then... then
what can they do to him? How can they convict him, even if they arrest
him? And Porfiry then had only just heard about the flat and had not
known about it before.
NA
by a sudden idea.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI got there two minutes before you. And I heard, I heard it all, how he
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhat? Why, then you were the surprise? But how could it happen? Upon my
NA
NA
â€œfor itâ€™s too late, said they, and maybe heâ€™ll be angry that we did not
come at the time. I was vexed and I lost my sleep, and I began making
inquiries. And finding out yesterday where to go, I went to-day. The
first time I went he wasnâ€™t there, when I came an hour later he couldnâ€™t
see me. I went the third time, and they showed me in. I informed him of
everything, just as it happened, and he began skipping about the room
and punching himself on the chest. â€˜What do you scoundrels mean by it?
If Iâ€™d known about it I should have arrested him!â€™ Then he ran out,
called somebody and began talking to him in the corner, then he turned
to me, scolding and questioning me. He scolded me a great deal; and I
told him everything, and I told him that you didnâ€™t dare to say a word
in answer to me yesterday and that you didnâ€™t recognise me. And he
fell to running about again and kept hitting himself on the chest, and
getting angry and running about, and when you were announced he told
me to go into the next room. â€˜Sit there a bit,â€™ he said. â€˜Donâ€™t move,
whatever you may hear.â€™ And he set a chair there for me and locked
me in. â€˜Perhaps,â€™ he said, â€˜I may call you.â€™ And when Nikolayâ€™d been
brought he let me out as soon as you were gone. â€˜I shall send for you
NA
NA

The man stood still, and again suddenly bowed down, touching the ground
with his finger.
NA
NA
And as he said this, the man bowed down again, but not to the ground,
turned slowly and went out of the room.

Raskolnikov, and he went out more confident than ever.

went down the stairs. His malice was aimed at himself; with shame and

PART V
CHAPTER I
The morning that followed the fateful interview with Dounia and
her mother brought sobering influences to bear on Pyotr Petrovitch.
Intensely unpleasant as it was, he was forced little by little to accept
as a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the day before
fantastic and incredible. The black snake of wounded vanity had been
gnawing at his heart all night. When he got out of bed, Pyotr Petrovitch
immediately looked in the looking-glass. He was afraid that he had
jaundice. However his health seemed unimpaired so far, and looking at
his noble, clear-skinned countenance which had grown fattish of
late, Pyotr Petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in the
conviction that he would find another bride and, perhaps, even a better
one. But coming back to the sense of his present position, he turned
aside and spat vigorously, which excited a sarcastic smile in Andrey
Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, the young friend with whom he was staying.
That smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed, and at once set it down against his
young friendâ€™s account. He had set down a good many points against him
of late. His anger was redoubled when he reflected that he ought not to
have told Andrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterdayâ€™s interview.
That was the second mistake he had made in temper, through impulsiveness
and irritability.... Moreover, all that morning one unpleasantness
followed another. He even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case
in the senate. He was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat
which had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and was being
redecorated at his own expense; the owner, a rich German tradesman,
would not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just
been signed and insisted on the full forfeit money, though Pyotr
Petrovitch would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated. In
the same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of the
instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the
flat.
NA
Petrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had a
gleam of desperate hope. â€œCan all that be really so irrevocably over?
NA
voluptuous pang through his heart. He endured anguish at that moment,
and if it had been possible to slay Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it,
Pyotr Petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish.
NA
he returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikovâ€™s room, â€œand why on earth was I
such a Jew? It was false economy! I meant to keep them without a penny
so that they should turn to me as their providence, and look at them!
foo! If Iâ€™d spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for the trousseau
and presents, on knick-knacks, dressing-cases, jewellery, materials, and
all that sort of trash from Knoppâ€™s and the English shop, my position
would have been better and... stronger! They could not have refused me
so easily! They are the sort of people that would feel bound to return
money and presents if they broke it off; and they would find it hard to
do it! And their conscience would prick them: how can we dismiss a man
who has hitherto been so generous and delicate?.... Hâ€™m! Iâ€™ve made a
NA
And grinding his teeth again, Pyotr Petrovitch called himself a
fool--but not aloud, of course.
He returned home, twice as irritated and angry as before. The
preparations for the funeral dinner at Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s excited
his curiosity as he passed. He had heard about it the day before; he
fancied, indeed, that he had been invited, but absorbed in his own cares
he had paid no attention. Inquiring of Madame Lippevechsel who was busy
laying the table while Katerina Ivanovna was away at the cemetery, he
heard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all the
lodgers had been invited, among them some who had not known the dead
man, that even Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of
his previous quarrel with Katerina Ivanovna, that he, Pyotr Petrovitch,
was not only invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the most
important of the lodgers. Amalia Ivanovna herself had been invited with
great ceremony in spite of the recent unpleasantness, and so she was
very busy with preparations and was taking a positive pleasure in them;
she was moreover dressed up to the nines, all in new black silk, and she
was proud of it. All this suggested an idea to Pyotr Petrovitch and he
went into his room, or rather Lebeziatnikovâ€™s, somewhat thoughtful. He
had learnt that Raskolnikov was to be one of the guests.
Andrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the morning. The attitude of
Pyotr Petrovitch to this gentleman was strange, though perhaps natural.
Pyotr Petrovitch had despised and hated him from the day he came to stay
with him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him. He
had not come to stay with him on his arrival in Petersburg simply from
parsimony, though that had been perhaps his chief object. He had heard
of Andrey Semyonovitch, who had once been his ward, as a leading young
progressive who was taking an important part in certain interesting
circles, the doings of which were a legend in the provinces. It had
impressed Pyotr Petrovitch. These powerful omniscient circles who
despised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him a
peculiar but quite vague alarm. He had not, of course, been able to form
even an approximate notion of what they meant. He, like everyone, had
heard that there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of some
sort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he exaggerated and
distorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree. What for
many years past he had feared more than anything was _being shown
up_ and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the
thought of transferring his business to Petersburg. He was afraid of
this as little children are sometimes panic-stricken. Some years before,
when he was just entering on his own career, he had come upon two cases
in which rather important personages in the province, patrons of his,
had been cruelly shown up. One instance had ended in great scandal
for the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious
trouble. For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to go into the
subject as soon as he reached Petersburg and, if necessary, to
anticipate contingencies by seeking the favour of â€œour younger
NA
his visit to Raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some current
phrases. He soon discovered that Andrey Semyonovitch was a commonplace
simpleton, but that by no means reassured Pyotr Petrovitch. Even if he
had been certain that all the progressives were fools like him, it
would not have allayed his uneasiness. All the doctrines, the ideas, the
systems, with which Andrey Semyonovitch pestered him had no interest for
him. He had his own object--he simply wanted to find out at once what
was happening _here_. Had these people any power or not? Had he anything
to fear from them? Would they expose any enterprise of his? And what
precisely was now the object of their attacks? Could he somehow make up
to them and get round them if they really were powerful? Was this the
thing to do or not? Couldnâ€™t he gain something through them? In fact
hundreds of questions presented themselves.
Andrey Semyonovitch was an anÃ¦mic, scrofulous little man, with strangely
flaxen mutton-chop whiskers of which he was very proud. He was a clerk
and had almost always something wrong with his eyes. He was rather
soft-hearted, but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited in
speech, which had an absurd effect, incongruous with his little figure.
He was one of the lodgers most respected by Amalia Ivanovna, for he did
not get drunk and paid regularly for his lodgings. Andrey Semyonovitch
really was rather stupid; he attached himself to the cause of progress
NA
and varied legion of dullards, of half-animate abortions, conceited,
half-educated coxcombs, who attach themselves to the idea most in
fashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve,
however sincerely.
Though Lebeziatnikov was so good-natured, he, too, was beginning to
dislike Pyotr Petrovitch. This happened on both sides unconsciously.
However simple Andrey Semyonovitch might be, he began to see that Pyotr
Petrovitch was duping him and secretly despising him, and that â€œhe was
NA
Fourier and the Darwinian theory, but of late Pyotr Petrovitch began to
listen too sarcastically and even to be rude. The fact was he had begun
instinctively to guess that Lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace
simpleton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he had no connections of
any consequence even in his own circle, but had simply picked things up
third-hand; and that very likely he did not even know much about his own
work of propaganda, for he was in too great a muddle. A fine person he
would be to show anyone up! It must be noted, by the way, that Pyotr
Petrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accepted the strangest
praise from Andrey Semyonovitch; he had not protested, for instance,
when Andrey Semyonovitch belauded him for being ready to contribute to
NA
his future children, or to acquiesce if Dounia were to take a lover a
month after marriage, and so on. Pyotr Petrovitch so enjoyed hearing
his own praises that he did not disdain even such virtues when they were
attributed to him.
Pyotr Petrovitch had had occasion that morning to realise some
five-per-cent bonds and now he sat down to the table and counted over
bundles of notes. Andrey Semyonovitch who hardly ever had any money
walked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bank
notes with indifference and even contempt. Nothing would have convinced
Pyotr Petrovitch that Andrey Semyonovitch could really look on the money
unmoved, and the latter, on his side, kept thinking bitterly that Pyotr
Petrovitch was capable of entertaining such an idea about him and
was, perhaps, glad of the opportunity of teasing his young friend by
reminding him of his inferiority and the great difference between them.
He found him incredibly inattentive and irritable, though he, Andrey
Semyonovitch, began enlarging on his favourite subject, the foundation
NA
Petrovitch between the clicking of the beads on the reckoning frame
NA
Semyonovitch ascribed Pyotr Petrovitchâ€™s ill-humour to his recent breach
with Dounia and he was burning with impatience to discourse on that
theme. He had something progressive to say on the subject which
NA
development.
â€œThere is some sort of festivity being prepared at that... at the
NA
Andrey Semyonovitch at the most interesting passage.
â€œWhy, donâ€™t you know? Why, I was telling you last night what I think
about all such ceremonies. And she invited you too, I heard. You were

â€œI should never have expected that beggarly fool would have spent on
this feast all the money she got from that other fool, Raskolnikov. I
was surprised just now as I came through at the preparations there, the
NA
Pyotr Petrovitch, who seemed to have some object in pursuing the
conversation. â€œWhat? You say I am asked too? When was that? I donâ€™t
remember. But I shanâ€™t go. Why should I? I only said a word to her in
passing yesterday of the possibility of her obtaining a yearâ€™s salary as
a destitute widow of a government clerk. I suppose she has invited me on
NA
NA
â€œI should think not, after giving her a thrashing! You might well
NA
NA
â€œWhy, you thrashed Katerina Ivanovna a month ago. I heard so
yesterday... so thatâ€™s what your convictions amount to... and the woman
NA
though comforted, went back to clicking his beads.
NA
afraid of allusions to the subject. â€œIt was not like that at all, it
was quite different. Youâ€™ve heard it wrong; itâ€™s a libel. I was simply
defending myself. She rushed at me first with her nails, she pulled
out all my whiskers.... Itâ€™s permissable for anyone, I should hope,
to defend himself and I never allow anyone to use violence to me on
principle, for itâ€™s an act of despotism. What was I to do? I simply
NA
NA
â€œYou keep on like that because you are out of humour yourself.... But
thatâ€™s nonsense and it has nothing, nothing whatever to do with the
woman question! You donâ€™t understand; I used to think, indeed, that
if women are equal to men in all respects, even in strength (as is
maintained now) there ought to be equality in that, too. Of course, I
reflected afterwards that such a question ought not really to arise,
for there ought not to be fighting and in the future society fighting is
unthinkable... and that it would be a queer thing to seek for equality
in fighting. I am not so stupid... though, of course, there is
fighting... there wonâ€™t be later, but at present there is... confound
it! How muddled one gets with you! Itâ€™s not on that account that I
am not going. I am not going on principle, not to take part in the
revolting convention of memorial dinners, thatâ€™s why! Though, of course,
one might go to laugh at it.... I am sorry there wonâ€™t be any priests at

â€œThen you would sit down at another manâ€™s table and insult it and those

â€œCertainly not insult, but protest. I should do it with a good object. I
might indirectly assist the cause of enlightenment and propaganda. Itâ€™s
a duty of every man to work for enlightenment and propaganda and the
more harshly, perhaps, the better. I might drop a seed, an idea.... And
something might grow up from that seed. How should I be insulting them?
They might be offended at first, but afterwards theyâ€™d see Iâ€™d done them
a service. You know, Terebyeva (who is in the community now) was blamed
because when she left her family and... devoted... herself, she wrote to
her father and mother that she wouldnâ€™t go on living conventionally and
was entering on a free marriage and it was said that that was too harsh,
that she might have spared them and have written more kindly. I think
thatâ€™s all nonsense and thereâ€™s no need of softness; on the contrary,
whatâ€™s wanted is protest. Varents had been married seven years, she
abandoned her two children, she told her husband straight out in a
letter: â€˜I have realised that I cannot be happy with you. I can never
forgive you that you have deceived me by concealing from me that there
is another organisation of society by means of the communities. I have
only lately learned it from a great-hearted man to whom I have given
myself and with whom I am establishing a community. I speak plainly
because I consider it dishonest to deceive you. Do as you think best.
Do not hope to get me back, you are too late. I hope you will be happy.â€™
NA
NA
â€œNo, itâ€™s only the second, really! But what if it were the fourth, what
if it were the fifteenth, thatâ€™s all nonsense! And if ever I regretted
the death of my father and mother, it is now, and I sometimes think
if my parents were living what a protest I would have aimed at them! I
would have done something on purpose... I would have shown them! I would

NA
interrupted, â€œbut tell me this; do you know the dead manâ€™s daughter, the
delicate-looking little thing? Itâ€™s true what they say about her, isnâ€™t
NA
â€œWhat of it? I think, that is, it is my own personal conviction that
this is the normal condition of women. Why not? I mean, _distinguons_.
In our present society it is not altogether normal, because it is
compulsory, but in the future society it will be perfectly normal,
because it will be voluntary. Even as it is, she was quite right: she
was suffering and that was her asset, so to speak, her capital which
she had a perfect right to dispose of. Of course, in the future
society there will be no need of assets, but her part will have another
significance, rational and in harmony with her environment. As to Sofya
Semyonovna personally, I regard her action as a vigorous protest against
the organisation of society, and I respect her deeply for it; I rejoice
NA
NA
Lebeziatnikov was enraged.
NA
Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s invention, for she did not understand! And I never
made love to Sofya Semyonovna! I was simply developing her, entirely
disinterestedly, trying to rouse her to protest.... All I wanted was her
NA
NA
â€œYou keep on laughing and very inappropriately, allow me to tell
you. You donâ€™t understand! There is no such rÃ´le in a community. The
community is established that there should be no such rÃ´les. In a
community, such a rÃ´le is essentially transformed and what is stupid
here is sensible there, what, under present conditions, is unnatural
becomes perfectly natural in the community. It all depends on the
environment. Itâ€™s all the environment and man himself is nothing. And
I am on good terms with Sofya Semyonovna to this day, which is a proof
that she never regarded me as having wronged her. I am trying now to
attract her to the community, but on quite, quite a different footing.
What are you laughing at? We are trying to establish a community of
our own, a special one, on a broader basis. We have gone further in our
convictions. We reject more! And meanwhile Iâ€™m still developing Sofya
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œBelieve me! Why should I disguise it? In fact, I feel it strange myself
NA
â€œAnd you, of course, are developing her... he-he! trying to prove to her
NA
â€œNot at all, not at all! How coarsely, how stupidly--excuse me saying
so--you misunderstand the word development! Good heavens, how... crude
you still are! We are striving for the freedom of women and you have
only one idea in your head.... Setting aside the general question
of chastity and feminine modesty as useless in themselves and indeed
prejudices, I fully accept her chastity with me, because thatâ€™s for her
to decide. Of course if she were to tell me herself that she wanted me,
I should think myself very lucky, because I like the girl very much; but
as it is, no one has ever treated her more courteously than I, with more
NA
â€œYou had much better make her a present of something. I bet you never
NA
â€œYou donâ€™t understand, as Iâ€™ve told you already! Of course, she is in
such a position, but itâ€™s another question. Quite another question!
You simply despise her. Seeing a fact which you mistakenly consider
deserving of contempt, you refuse to take a humane view of a fellow
creature. You donâ€™t know what a character she is! I am only sorry that
of late she has quite given up reading and borrowing books. I used
to lend them to her. I am sorry, too, that with all the energy and
resolution in protesting--which she has already shown once--she has
little self-reliance, little, so to say, independence, so as to
break free from certain prejudices and certain foolish ideas. Yet she
thoroughly understands some questions, for instance about kissing of
hands, that is, that itâ€™s an insult to a woman for a man to kiss her
hand, because itâ€™s a sign of inequality. We had a debate about it and
I described it to her. She listened attentively to an account of the
workmenâ€™s associations in France, too. Now I am explaining the question

referred prematurely to the question of personal privacy! Itâ€™s always
a stumbling-block to people like you, they turn it into ridicule before
they understand it. And how proud they are of it, too! Tfoo! Iâ€™ve often
maintained that that question should not be approached by a novice till
he has a firm faith in the system. And tell me, please, what do you
find so shameful even in cesspools? I should be the first to be ready
to clean out any cesspool you like. And itâ€™s not a question of
self-sacrifice, itâ€™s simply work, honourable, useful work which is
as good as any other and much better than the work of a Raphael and a

NA
â€œWhat do you mean by â€˜more honourableâ€™? I donâ€™t understand such
expressions to describe human activity. â€˜More honourable,â€™ â€˜noblerâ€™--all
those are old-fashioned prejudices which I reject. Everything which is
_of use_ to mankind is honourable. I only understand one word: _useful_!

Pyotr Petrovitch laughed heartily. He had finished counting the money
and was putting it away. But some of the notes he left on the table. The

amused Luzhin and at that moment he particularly wanted to anger his
young friend.

wanted to speak to her about... However, you may be present during the

Five minutes later Lebeziatnikov came in with Sonia. She came in very
much surprised and overcome with shyness as usual. She was always shy in
such circumstances and was always afraid of new people, she had been as
a child and was even more so now.... Pyotr Petrovitch met her â€œpolitely

his opinion was suitable for a man of his respectability and weight
in dealing with a creature so young and so _interesting_ as she. He

lying on the table and then again at Pyotr Petrovitch and her eyes
remained riveted on him. Lebeziatnikov was moving to the door. Pyotr
Petrovitch signed to Sonia to remain seated and stopped Lebeziatnikov.
NA
â€œRaskolnikov? Yes. Why? Yes, he is there. I saw him just come in....
NA
â€œWell, I particularly beg you to remain here with us and not to leave
me alone with this... young woman. I only want a few words with her,
but God knows what they may make of it. I shouldnâ€™t like Raskolnikov to

attentively at her and assumed an extremely dignified, even severe

NA
simplicity and ignorance of good manners, â€œand you know me little, my
dear Sofya Semyonovna, if you suppose I would have ventured to trouble
a person like you for a matter of so little consequence affecting myself
NA
Sonia sat down hurriedly. Her eyes rested again for an instant on the
grey-and-rainbow-coloured notes that remained on the table, but she
quickly looked away and fixed her eyes on Pyotr Petrovitch. She felt it
horribly indecorous, especially for _her_, to look at another personâ€™s
money. She stared at the gold eye-glass which Pyotr Petrovitch held
in his left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome ring with a
yellow stone on his middle finger. But suddenly she looked away and, not
knowing where to turn, ended by staring Pyotr Petrovitch again straight
in the face. After a pause of still greater dignity he continued.
â€œI chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple of words with
Katerina Ivanovna, poor woman. That was sufficient to enable me to
ascertain that she is in a position--preternatural, if one may so
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œQuite so. So then from a feeling of humanity and so to speak
compassion, I should be glad to be of service to her in any way,
foreseeing her unfortunate position. I believe the whole of this
NA
NA
yesterday of the possibility of a pension? Because she told me you had
NA
â€œNot in the slightest, and indeed itâ€™s an absurdity! I merely hinted at
her obtaining temporary assistance as the widow of an official who had
died in the service--if only she has patronage... but apparently your
late parent had not served his full term and had not indeed been in the
service at all of late. In fact, if there could be any hope, it would be
very ephemeral, because there would be no claim for assistance in
that case, far from it.... And she is dreaming of a pension already,
NA
â€œYes, she is. For she is credulous and good-hearted, and she believes
everything from the goodness of her heart and... and... and she is like

time.
â€œSeeing her position with her unfortunate little ones, I should be glad,
as I have said before, so far as lies in my power, to be of service,
that is, so far as is in my power, not more. One might for instance get
up a subscription for her, or a lottery, something of the sort, such as
is always arranged in such cases by friends or even outsiders desirous
of assisting people. It was of that I intended to speak to you; it might

NA
at Pyotr Petrovitch.
â€œIt might be, but we will talk of it later. We might begin it to-day, we
will talk it over this evening and lay the foundation so to speak. Come
to me at seven oâ€™clock. Mr. Lebeziatnikov, I hope, will assist us. But
there is one circumstance of which I ought to warn you beforehand and
for which I venture to trouble you, Sofya Semyonovna, to come here. In
my opinion money cannot be, indeed itâ€™s unsafe to put it into Katerina
Ivanovnaâ€™s own hands. The dinner to-day is a proof of that. Though she
has not, so to speak, a crust of bread for to-morrow and... well, boots
or shoes, or anything; she has bought to-day Jamaica rum, and even,
I believe, Madeira and... and coffee. I saw it as I passed through.
To-morrow it will all fall upon you again, they wonâ€™t have a crust of
bread. Itâ€™s absurd, really, and so, to my thinking, a subscription ought
to be raised so that the unhappy widow should not know of the money, but
NA
â€œI donâ€™t know... this is only to-day, once in her life.... She was
so anxious to do honour, to celebrate the memory.... And she is very
sensible... but just as you think and I shall be very, very... they will

Sonia burst into tears.
â€œVery well, then, keep it in mind; and now will you accept for the
benefit of your relation the small sum that I am able to spare, from me
personally. I am very anxious that my name should not be mentioned in
connection with it. Here... having so to speak anxieties of my own, I
NA
And Pyotr Petrovitch held out to Sonia a ten-rouble note carefully
unfolded. Sonia took it, flushed crimson, jumped up, muttered something
and began taking leave. Pyotr Petrovitch accompanied her ceremoniously
to the door. She got out of the room at last, agitated and distressed,
and returned to Katerina Ivanovna, overwhelmed with confusion.
All this time Lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walked about the
room, anxious not to interrupt the conversation; when Sonia had gone he
walked up to Pyotr Petrovitch and solemnly held out his hand.
NA
â€œThat is honourable, I mean to say, itâ€™s humane! You wanted to avoid
gratitude, I saw! And although I cannot, I confess, in principle
sympathise with private charity, for it not only fails to eradicate the
evil but even promotes it, yet I must admit that I saw your action with
NA
NA
looking carefully at Lebeziatnikov.
â€œNo, itâ€™s not nonsense! A man who has suffered distress and annoyance as
you did yesterday and who yet can sympathise with the misery of others,
such a man... even though he is making a social mistake--is still
deserving of respect! I did not expect it indeed of you, Pyotr
Petrovitch, especially as according to your ideas... oh, what a drawback
your ideas are to you! How distressed you are for instance by your
NA
a return of affection for Pyotr Petrovitch. â€œAnd, what do you want with
marriage, with _legal_ marriage, my dear, noble Pyotr Petrovitch? Why do
you cling to this _legality_ of marriage? Well, you may beat me if you
like, but I am glad, positively glad it hasnâ€™t come off, that you are
free, that you are not quite lost for humanity.... you see, Iâ€™ve spoken
NA
â€œBecause I donâ€™t want in your free marriage to be made a fool of and
NA
 Luzhin replied in order to make some answer.
He seemed preoccupied by something.
NA
a warhorse at the trumpet call. â€œChildren are a social question and a
question of first importance, I agree; but the question of children has
another solution. Some refuse to have children altogether, because they
suggest the institution of the family. Weâ€™ll speak of children later,
but now as to the question of honour, I confess thatâ€™s my weak point.
That horrid, military, Pushkin expression is unthinkable in the
dictionary of the future. What does it mean indeed? Itâ€™s nonsense,
there will be no deception in a free marriage! That is only the natural
consequence of a legal marriage, so to say, its corrective, a protest.
So that indeed itâ€™s not humiliating... and if I ever, to suppose an
absurdity, were to be legally married, I should be positively glad of
it. I should say to my wife: â€˜My dear, hitherto I have loved you, now
I respect you, for youâ€™ve shown you can protest!â€™ You laugh! Thatâ€™s
because you are incapable of getting away from prejudices. Confound
it all! I understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived
in a legal marriage, but itâ€™s simply a despicable consequence of a
despicable position in which both are humiliated. When the deception is
open, as in a free marriage, then it does not exist, itâ€™s unthinkable.
Your wife will only prove how she respects you by considering you
incapable of opposing her happiness and avenging yourself on her for
her new husband. Damn it all! I sometimes dream if I were to be married,
pfoo! I mean if I were to marry, legally or not, itâ€™s just the same,
I should present my wife with a lover if she had not found one for
herself. â€˜My dear,â€™ I should say, â€˜I love you, but even more than that I
NA
Pyotr Petrovitch sniggered as he listened, but without much merriment.
He hardly heard it indeed. He was preoccupied with something else and
even Lebeziatnikov at last noticed it. Pyotr Petrovitch seemed excited
and rubbed his hands. Lebeziatnikov remembered all this and reflected
upon it afterwards.
CHAPTER II
It would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated the
idea of that senseless dinner in Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s disordered brain.
Nearly ten of the twenty roubles, given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladovâ€™s
funeral, were wasted upon it. Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to
NA
and still more Amalia Ivanovna, might know â€œthat he was in no way their
NA
NA
NA
their last savings on some traditional social ceremony, simply in order
NA
probable, too, that Katerina Ivanovna longed on this occasion, at
the moment when she seemed to be abandoned by everyone, to show those
NA
NA
NA
sweeping floors and washing the childrenâ€™s rags at night. Even the
poorest and most broken-spirited people are sometimes liable to these
paroxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible
nervous craving. And Katerina Ivanovna was not broken-spirited; she
might have been killed by circumstance, but her spirit could not have
been broken, that is, she could not have been intimidated, her will
could not be crushed. Moreover Sonia had said with good reason that her
mind was unhinged. She could not be said to be insane, but for a year
past she had been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained.
The later stages of consumption are apt, doctors tell us, to affect the
intellect.
There was no great variety of wines, nor was there Madeira; but wine
there was. There was vodka, rum and Lisbon wine, all of the poorest
quality but in sufficient quantity. Besides the traditional rice and
honey, there were three or four dishes, one of which consisted of
pancakes, all prepared in Amalia Ivanovnaâ€™s kitchen. Two samovars were
boiling, that tea and punch might be offered after dinner. Katerina
Ivanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions, with the help
of one of the lodgers, an unfortunate little Pole who had somehow been
stranded at Madame Lippevechselâ€™s. He promptly put himself at Katerina
Ivanovnaâ€™s disposal and had been all that morning and all the day before
running about as fast as his legs could carry him, and very anxious
that everyone should be aware of it. For every trifle he ran to Katerina
Ivanovna, even hunting her out at the bazaar, at every instant called
NA
she had declared at first that she could not have got on without this
NA
characteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours.
Her praises were so exaggerated as sometimes to be embarrassing; she
would invent various circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance
and quite genuinely believe in their reality. Then all of a sudden she
would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the
person she had only a few hours before been literally adoring. She
was naturally of a gay, lively and peace-loving disposition, but from
continual failures and misfortunes she had come to desire so _keenly_
that all should live in peace and joy and should not _dare_ to break the
peace, that the slightest jar, the smallest disaster reduced her almost
to frenzy, and she would pass in an instant from the brightest hopes and
fancies to cursing her fate and raving, and knocking her head against
the wall.
Amalia Ivanovna, too, suddenly acquired extraordinary importance in
Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s eyes and was treated by her with extraordinary
respect, probably only because Amalia Ivanovna had thrown herself heart
and soul into the preparations. She had undertaken to lay the table,
to provide the linen, crockery, etc., and to cook the dishes in her
kitchen, and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her hands and gone
herself to the cemetery. Everything had been well done. Even the
table-cloth was nearly clean; the crockery, knives, forks and glasses
were, of course, of all shapes and patterns, lent by different lodgers,
but the table was properly laid at the time fixed, and Amalia Ivanovna,
feeling she had done her work well, had put on a black silk dress and
a cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some
pride. This pride, though justifiable, displeased Katerina Ivanovna for
some reason: â€œas though the table could not have been laid except by
NA
be stuck up, the stupid German, because she was mistress of the house,
and had consented as a favour to help her poor lodgers! As a favour!
Fancy that! Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s father who had been a colonel and almost
a governor had sometimes had the table set for forty persons, and then
anyone like Amalia Ivanovna, or rather Ludwigovna, would not have been
NA
Katerina Ivanovna, however, put off expressing her feelings for the
time and contented herself with treating her coldly, though she decided
inwardly that she would certainly have to put Amalia Ivanovna down
and set her in her proper place, for goodness only knew what she was
fancying herself. Katerina Ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that
hardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral, except
the Pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery, while to the
memorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turned
up, the wretched creatures, many of them not quite sober. The older
and more respectable of them all, as if by common consent, stayed away.
Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, for instance, who might be said to be the most
respectable of all the lodgers, did not appear, though Katerina Ivanovna
had the evening before told all the world, that is Amalia Ivanovna,
Polenka, Sonia and the Pole, that he was the most generous,
noble-hearted man with a large property and vast connections, who had
been a friend of her first husbandâ€™s, and a guest in her fatherâ€™s
house, and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her
a considerable pension. It must be noted that when Katerina Ivanovna
exalted anyoneâ€™s connections and fortune, it was without any ulterior
motive, quite disinterestedly, for the mere pleasure of adding to
NA
Luzhin, â€œthat contemptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned up
either. What did he fancy himself? He was only asked out of kindness
and because he was sharing the same room with Pyotr Petrovitch and was a

Among those who failed to appear were â€œthe genteel lady and her

last fortnight, but had several times complained of the noise and uproar
in Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s room, especially when Marmeladov had come
back drunk. Katerina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who,
quarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna, and threatening to turn the whole
family out of doors, had shouted at her that they â€œwere not worth the
NA
Ivanovna determined now to invite this lady and her daughter, â€œwhose
NA
casually met them, so that they might know that â€œshe was more noble in
NA
that she was not accustomed to her way of living. She had proposed to
make this clear to them at dinner with allusions to her late fatherâ€™s
governorship, and also at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly
stupid of them to turn away on meeting her. The fat colonel-major (he
was really a discharged officer of low rank) was also absent, but it
NA
consisted of the Pole, a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face and
a greasy coat, who had not a word to say for himself, and smelt
abominably, a deaf and almost blind old man who had once been in the
post office and who had been from immemorial ages maintained by someone
at Amalia Ivanovnaâ€™s.
A retired clerk of the commissariat department came, too; he was
drunk, had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy--was without
a waistcoat! One of the visitors sat straight down to the table without
even greeting Katerina Ivanovna. Finally one person having no suit
appeared in his dressing-gown, but this was too much, and the efforts of
Amalia Ivanovna and the Pole succeeded in removing him. The Pole brought
with him, however, two other Poles who did not live at Amalia Ivanovnaâ€™s
and whom no one had seen here before. All this irritated Katerina
Ivanovna intensely. â€œFor whom had they made all these preparations
NA
for at the table; but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in the
furthest corner with their dinner laid on a box, while Polenka as a big
girl had to look after them, feed them, and keep their noses wiped like
well-bred childrenâ€™s.
Katerina Ivanovna, in fact, could hardly help meeting her guests with
increased dignity, and even haughtiness. She stared at some of them with
special severity, and loftily invited them to take their seats. Rushing
to the conclusion that Amalia Ivanovna must be responsible for those who
were absent, she began treating her with extreme nonchalance, which the
latter promptly observed and resented. Such a beginning was no good omen
for the end. All were seated at last.
Raskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from the
cemetery. Katerina Ivanovna was greatly delighted to see him, in the
first place, because he was the one â€œeducated visitor, and, as everyone
NA
secondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised for having
been unable to be at the funeral. She positively pounced upon him, and
made him sit on her left hand (Amalia Ivanovna was on her right). In
spite of her continual anxiety that the dishes should be passed round
correctly and that everyone should taste them, in spite of the agonising
cough which interrupted her every minute and seemed to have grown worse
during the last few days, she hastened to pour out in a half whisper to
Raskolnikov all her suppressed feelings and her just indignation at
the failure of the dinner, interspersing her remarks with lively and
uncontrollable laughter at the expense of her visitors and especially of
her landlady.
NA
Ivanovna nodded towards the landlady. â€œLook at her, sheâ€™s making round
eyes, she feels that we are talking about her and canâ€™t understand.
Pfoo, the owl! Ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) And what does she put on that
cap for? (Cough-cough-cough.) Have you noticed that she wants everyone
to consider that she is patronising me and doing me an honour by being
here? I asked her like a sensible woman to invite people, especially
those who knew my late husband, and look at the set of fools she has
brought! The sweeps! Look at that one with the spotty face. And those
wretched Poles, ha-ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) Not one of them has ever
poked his nose in here, Iâ€™ve never set eyes on them. What have they come
NA
suddenly to one of them, â€œhave you tasted the pancakes? Take some more!
Have some beer! Wonâ€™t you have some vodka? Look, heâ€™s jumped up and is
making his bows, they must be quite starved, poor things. Never mind,
let them eat! They donâ€™t make a noise, anyway, though Iâ€™m really afraid
NA
suddenly, almost aloud, â€œif your spoons should happen to be stolen,
NA
Raskolnikov, and again nodding towards the landlady, in high glee at her
sally. â€œShe didnâ€™t understand, she didnâ€™t understand again! Look how
she sits with her mouth open! An owl, a real owl! An owl in new ribbons,
NA
Here her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of coughing that
lasted five minutes. Drops of perspiration stood out on her forehead
and her handkerchief was stained with blood. She showed Raskolnikov
the blood in silence, and as soon as she could get her breath began
whispering to him again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on her
cheeks.
â€œDo you know, I gave her the most delicate instructions, so to speak,
for inviting that lady and her daughter, you understand of whom I am
speaking? It needed the utmost delicacy, the greatest nicety, but she
has managed things so that that fool, that conceited baggage, that
provincial nonentity, simply because she is the widow of a major, and
has come to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirts in the
government offices, because at fifty she paints her face (everybody
knows it)... a creature like that did not think fit to come, and has
not even answered the invitation, which the most ordinary good manners
required! I canâ€™t understand why Pyotr Petrovitch has not come? But
whereâ€™s Sonia? Where has she gone? Ah, there she is at last! what is it,
Sonia, where have you been? Itâ€™s odd that even at your fatherâ€™s funeral
you should be so unpunctual. Rodion Romanovitch, make room for her
beside you. Thatâ€™s your place, Sonia... take what you like. Have some of
the cold entrÃ©e with jelly, thatâ€™s the best. Theyâ€™ll bring the pancakes
directly. Have they given the children some? Polenka, have you got
everything? (Cough-cough-cough.) Thatâ€™s all right. Be a good girl, Lida,
and, Kolya, donâ€™t fidget with your feet; sit like a little gentleman.
NA
Sonia hastened to give her Pyotr Petrovitchâ€™s apologies, trying to
speak loud enough for everyone to hear and carefully choosing the most
respectful phrases which she attributed to Pyotr Petrovitch. She added
that Pyotr Petrovitch had particularly told her to say that, as soon as
he possibly could, he would come immediately to discuss _business_ alone
with her and to consider what could be done for her, etc., etc.
Sonia knew that this would comfort Katerina Ivanovna, would flatter her
and gratify her pride. She sat down beside Raskolnikov; she made him a
hurried bow, glancing curiously at him. But for the rest of the time
she seemed to avoid looking at him or speaking to him. She seemed
absent-minded, though she kept looking at Katerina Ivanovna, trying
to please her. Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna had been able to get
mourning; Sonia was wearing dark brown, and Katerina Ivanovna had on her
only dress, a dark striped cotton one.
The message from Pyotr Petrovitch was very successful. Listening to
Sonia with dignity, Katerina Ivanovna inquired with equal dignity how
Pyotr Petrovitch was, then at once whispered almost aloud to
Raskolnikov that it certainly would have been strange for a man of
Pyotr Petrovitchâ€™s position and standing to find himself in such
NA
old friendship with her father.
â€œThatâ€™s why I am so grateful to you, Rodion Romanovitch, that you have

Then once more with pride and dignity she scanned her visitors, and
suddenly inquired aloud across the table of the deaf man: â€œWouldnâ€™t he

no answer and for a long while could not understand what he was asked,
though his neighbours amused themselves by poking and shaking him. He
simply gazed about him with his mouth open, which only increased the
general mirth.
â€œWhat an imbecile! Look, look! Why was he brought? But as to Pyotr

NA
face she addressed Amalia Ivanovna so sharply and loudly that the latter
was quite disconcerted, â€œnot like your dressed up draggletails whom
my father would not have taken as cooks into his kitchen, and my late
husband would have done them honour if he had invited them in the
NA
NA
commissariat clerk, gulping down his twelfth glass of vodka.
â€œMy late husband certainly had that weakness, and everyone knows
NA
honourable man, who loved and respected his family. The worst of it was
his good nature made him trust all sorts of disreputable people, and he
drank with fellows who were not worth the sole of his shoe. Would you
believe it, Rodion Romanovitch, they found a gingerbread cock in his

NA
Katerina Ivanovna did not vouchsafe a reply. She sighed, lost in
thought.
NA
went on, addressing Raskolnikov. â€œBut thatâ€™s not so! He respected me, he
respected me very much! He was a kind-hearted man! And how sorry I was
for him sometimes! He would sit in a corner and look at me, I used to
feel so sorry for him, I used to want to be kind to him and then would
think to myself: â€˜Be kind to him and he will drink again,â€™ it was only
NA
NA
commissariat clerk again, swallowing another glass of vodka.
â€œSome fools would be the better for a good drubbing, as well as having
NA
Ivanovna snapped at him.
The flush on her cheeks grew more and more marked, her chest heaved. In
another minute she would have been ready to make a scene. Many of the
visitors were sniggering, evidently delighted. They began poking the
commissariat clerk and whispering something to him. They were evidently
trying to egg him on.
NA
to say, whose... about whom... did you say just now... But I donâ€™t care!
NA
And he took another drink of vodka.
Raskolnikov sat in silence, listening with disgust. He only ate from
politeness, just tasting the food that Katerina Ivanovna was continually
putting on his plate, to avoid hurting her feelings. He watched Sonia
intently. But Sonia became more and more anxious and distressed; she,
too, foresaw that the dinner would not end peaceably, and saw with
terror Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s growing irritation. She knew that she, Sonia,
was the chief reason for the â€˜genteelâ€™ ladiesâ€™ contemptuous treatment of
Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s invitation. She had heard from Amalia Ivanovna that
the mother was positively offended at the invitation and had asked the
question: â€œHow could she let her daughter sit down beside _that young

this and an insult to Sonia meant more to Katerina Ivanovna than an
insult to herself, her children, or her father, Sonia knew that
Katerina Ivanovna would not be satisfied now, â€œtill she had shown those

passed Sonia, from the other end of the table, a plate with two hearts
pierced with an arrow, cut out of black bread. Katerina Ivanovna flushed
crimson and at once said aloud across the table that the man who sent it
NA
Amalia Ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss, and at the same time
deeply wounded by Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s haughtiness, and to restore the
good-humour of the company and raise herself in their esteem she began,
apropos of nothing, telling a story about an acquaintance of hers â€œKarl
NA
cabman wanted him to kill, and Karl very much begged him not to kill,
and wept and clasped hands, and frightened and from fear pierced his

Amalia Ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in Russian; the latter was
still more offended, and she retorted that her â€œ_Vater aus Berlin_ was a
NA
Ivanovna could not restrain herself and laughed so much that Amalia
Ivanovna lost patience and could scarcely control herself.
NA
good-humour almost restored, â€œshe meant to say he kept his hands in
his pockets, but she said he put his hands in peopleâ€™s pockets.
(Cough-cough.) And have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that all these
Petersburg foreigners, the Germans especially, are all stupider than
we! Can you fancy anyone of us telling how â€˜Karl from the chemistâ€™sâ€™
â€˜pierced his heart from fearâ€™ and that the idiot, instead of punishing
the cabman, â€˜clasped his hands and wept, and much begged.â€™ Ah, the fool!
And you know she fancies itâ€™s very touching and does not suspect how
stupid she is! To my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great
deal cleverer, anyway one can see that he has addled his brains with
drink, but you know, these foreigners are always so well behaved
and serious.... Look how she sits glaring! She is angry, ha-ha!
NA
Regaining her good-humour, Katerina Ivanovna began at once telling
Raskolnikov that when she had obtained her pension, she intended to open
a school for the daughters of gentlemen in her native town T----.
This was the first time she had spoken to him of the project, and she
launched out into the most alluring details. It suddenly appeared that
Katerina Ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of honour of
which Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov in the tavern, when he told
him that Katerina Ivanovna, his wife, had danced the shawl dance
before the governor and other great personages on leaving school. This
certificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove Katerina
Ivanovnaâ€™s right to open a boarding-school; but she had armed herself
with it chiefly with the object of overwhelming â€œthose two stuck-up
NA
that Katerina Ivanovna was of the most noble, â€œshe might even say
aristocratic family, a colonelâ€™s daughter and was far superior to
NA
certificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of the drunken
guests, and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to retain it, for it actually
contained the statement _en toutes lettres_, that her father was of the
rank of a major, and also a companion of an order, so that she really
was almost the daughter of a colonel.
Warming up, Katerina Ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and
happy life they would lead in T----, on the gymnasium teachers whom
she would engage to give lessons in her boarding-school, one a most
respectable old Frenchman, one Mangot, who had taught Katerina Ivanovna
herself in old days and was still living in T----, and would no doubt
teach in her school on moderate terms. Next she spoke of Sonia who would
go with her to T---- and help her in all her plans. At this someone at
the further end of the table gave a sudden guffaw.
Though Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware of
it, she raised her voice and began at once speaking with conviction of
Soniaâ€™s undoubted ability to assist her, of â€œher gentleness, patience,
NA
kissing her warmly twice. Sonia flushed crimson, and Katerina Ivanovna
suddenly burst into tears, immediately observing that she was â€œnervous
and silly, that she was too much upset, that it was time to finish, and
NA
At that moment, Amalia Ivanovna, deeply aggrieved at taking no part in
the conversation, and not being listened to, made one last effort,
and with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty
observation, that â€œin the future boarding-school she would have to pay
particular attention to _die WÃ¤sche_, and that there certainly must be a
good _dame_ to look after the linen, and secondly that the young ladies
NA
Katerina Ivanovna, who certainly was upset and very tired, as well as
heartily sick of the dinner, at once cut short Amalia Ivanovna, saying
â€œshe knew nothing about it and was talking nonsense, that it was the
business of the laundry maid, and not of the directress of a high-class
boarding-school to look after _die WÃ¤sche_, and as for novel-reading,
NA
Ivanovna fired up and getting angry observed that she only â€œmeant her
NA
NA
NA
say she wished her good, because only yesterday when her dead husband
was lying on the table, she had worried her about the lodgings. To this
Amalia Ivanovna very appropriately observed that she had invited those
ladies, but â€œthose ladies had not come, because those ladies _are_
NA
at once pointed out to her, that as she was a slut she could not judge
what made one really a lady. Amalia Ivanovna at once declared that her
â€œ_Vater aus Berlin_ was a very, very important man, and both hands in
NA
up from the table to represent her father, sticking her hands in her
pockets, puffing her cheeks, and uttering vague sounds resembling â€œpoof!
NA
Amalia Ivanovna, hoping for a fight.
But this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna, and she at once declared,
so that all could hear, that Amalia Ivanovna probably never had a
father, but was simply a drunken Petersburg Finn, and had certainly once
been a cook and probably something worse. Amalia Ivanovna turned as red
as a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna never had a
father, â€œbut she had a _Vater aus Berlin_ and that he wore a long coat
NA
Katerina Ivanovna observed contemptuously that all knew what her family
was and that on that very certificate of honour it was stated in print
that her father was a colonel, while Amalia Ivanovnaâ€™s father--if she
really had one--was probably some Finnish milkman, but that probably she
never had a father at all, since it was still uncertain whether her name
was Amalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna.
At this Amalia Ivanovna, lashed to fury, struck the table with her fist,
and shrieked that she was Amalia Ivanovna, and not Ludwigovna, â€œthat
her _Vater_ was named Johann and that he was a burgomeister, and that
NA
Ivanovna rose from her chair, and with a stern and apparently calm voice
(though she was pale and her chest was heaving) observed that â€œif she
dared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on a
level with her papa, she, Katerina Ivanovna, would tear her cap off her
NA
shouting at the top of her voice, that she was mistress of the house and
that Katerina Ivanovna should leave the lodgings that minute; then she
rushed for some reason to collect the silver spoons from the table.
There was a great outcry and uproar, the children began crying. Sonia
ran to restrain Katerina Ivanovna, but when Amalia Ivanovna shouted
NA
away, and rushed at the landlady to carry out her threat.
At that minute the door opened, and Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin appeared
on the threshold. He stood scanning the party with severe and vigilant
eyes. Katerina Ivanovna rushed to him.

squabbles with Amalia Ivanovna.... I have come here to speak of my own
affairs... and I want to have a word with your stepdaughter, Sofya...
NA
Pyotr Petrovitch, edging by her, went to the opposite corner where Sonia
was.
Katerina Ivanovna remained standing where she was, as though
thunderstruck. She could not understand how Pyotr Petrovitch could deny
having enjoyed her fatherâ€™s hospitality. Though she had invented it
herself, she believed in it firmly by this time. She was struck too
by the businesslike, dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of Pyotr
Petrovitch. All the clamour gradually died away at his entrance. Not
NA
rest of the party, but it was evident, too, that he had come upon some
matter of consequence, that some exceptional cause must have brought him
and that therefore something was going to happen. Raskolnikov, standing
beside Sonia, moved aside to let him pass; Pyotr Petrovitch did not
seem to notice him. A minute later Lebeziatnikov, too, appeared in the
doorway; he did not come in, but stood still, listening with marked
interest, almost wonder, and seemed for a time perplexed.
â€œExcuse me for possibly interrupting you, but itâ€™s a matter of

generally. â€œI am glad indeed to find other persons present. Amalia
Ivanovna, I humbly beg you as mistress of the house to pay careful

 he went on, addressing Sonia, who was very much surprised and already
alarmed, â€œimmediately after your visit I found that a hundred-rouble
note was missing from my table, in the room of my friend Mr.
Lebeziatnikov. If in any way whatever you know and will tell us where
it is now, I assure you on my word of honour and call all present to
witness that the matter shall end there. In the opposite case I shall be
compelled to have recourse to very serious measures and then... you must

Complete silence reigned in the room. Even the crying children were
still. Sonia stood deadly pale, staring at Luzhin and unable to say a
word. She seemed not to understand. Some seconds passed.
NA
NA
last.
NA
NA
as it were, admonishing her. â€œReflect, I am prepared to give you time
for consideration. Kindly observe this: if I were not so entirely
convinced I should not, you may be sure, with my experience venture to
accuse you so directly. Seeing that for such direct accusation before
witnesses, if false or even mistaken, I should myself in a certain sense
be made responsible, I am aware of that. This morning I changed for
my own purposes several five-per-cent securities for the sum of
approximately three thousand roubles. The account is noted down in my
pocket-book. On my return home I proceeded to count the money--as Mr.
Lebeziatnikov will bear witness--and after counting two thousand three
hundred roubles I put the rest in my pocket-book in my coat pocket.
About five hundred roubles remained on the table and among them three
notes of a hundred roubles each. At that moment you entered (at my
invitation)--and all the time you were present you were exceedingly
embarrassed; so that three times you jumped up in the middle of the
conversation and tried to make off. Mr. Lebeziatnikov can bear witness
to this. You yourself, mademoiselle, probably will not refuse to confirm
my statement that I invited you through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, solely in
order to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute position of your
relative, Katerina Ivanovna (whose dinner I was unable to attend),
and the advisability of getting up something of the nature of a
subscription, lottery or the like, for her benefit. You thanked me and
even shed tears. I describe all this as it took place, primarily to
recall it to your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest
detail has escaped my recollection. Then I took a ten-rouble note from
the table and handed it to you by way of first instalment on my part
for the benefit of your relative. Mr. Lebeziatnikov saw all this. Then
I accompanied you to the door--you being still in the same state of
embarrassment--after which, being left alone with Mr. Lebeziatnikov I
talked to him for ten minutes--then Mr. Lebeziatnikov went out and I
returned to the table with the money lying on it, intending to count
it and to put it aside, as I proposed doing before. To my surprise one
hundred-rouble note had disappeared. Kindly consider the position.
Mr. Lebeziatnikov I cannot suspect. I am ashamed to allude to such
a supposition. I cannot have made a mistake in my reckoning, for the
minute before your entrance I had finished my accounts and found the
total correct. You will admit that recollecting your embarrassment, your
eagerness to get away and the fact that you kept your hands for some
time on the table, and taking into consideration your social position
and the habits associated with it, I was, so to say, with horror and
positively against my will, _compelled_ to entertain a suspicion--a
cruel, but justifiable suspicion! I will add further and repeat that in
spite of my positive conviction, I realise that I run a certain risk in
making this accusation, but as you see, I could not let it pass. I have
taken action and I will tell you why: solely, madam, solely, owing
to your black ingratitude! Why! I invite you for the benefit of your
destitute relative, I present you with my donation of ten roubles and
you, on the spot, repay me for all that with such an action. It is too
bad! You need a lesson. Reflect! Moreover, like a true friend I beg
you--and you could have no better friend at this moment--think what you

NA
NA
Sonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket, untied a corner of it,
took out the ten-rouble note and gave it to Luzhin.
NA
reproachfully, not taking the note.
Sonia looked about her. All were looking at her with such awful, stern,
ironical, hostile eyes. She looked at Raskolnikov... he stood against
the wall, with his arms crossed, looking at her with glowing eyes.
NA
â€œAmalia Ivanovna, we shall have to send word to the police and therefore
NA
softly and even kindly.
NA
Ivanovna, throwing up her hands.
NA

There was a buzz of loud conversation on all sides. All were in
movement.
NA
she rushed at Luzhin. â€œWhat! You accuse her of stealing? Sonia? Ah, the

And running to Sonia she flung her wasted arms round her and held her as
in a vise.
â€œSonia! how dared you take ten roubles from him? Foolish girl! Give it
NA
And snatching the note from Sonia, Katerina Ivanovna crumpled it up and
flung it straight into Luzhinâ€™s face. It hit him in the eye and fell
on the ground. Amalia Ivanovna hastened to pick it up. Pyotr Petrovitch
lost his temper.
NA
At that moment several other persons, besides Lebeziatnikov, appeared in
the doorway, among them the two ladies.
NA
idiot yourself, pettifogging lawyer, base man! Sonia, Sonia take his

Ivanovna broke into hysterical laughter. â€œDid you ever see such an

the landlady, â€œand you too, sausage eater, you declare that she is a
thief, you trashy Prussian henâ€™s leg in a crinoline! She hasnâ€™t been
out of this room: she came straight from you, you wretch, and sat down
beside me, everyone saw her. She sat here, by Rodion Romanovitch. Search
her! Since sheâ€™s not left the room, the money would have to be on her!
Search her, search her! But if you donâ€™t find it, then excuse me, my
dear fellow, youâ€™ll answer for it! Iâ€™ll go to our Sovereign, to our
Sovereign, to our gracious Tsar himself, and throw myself at his feet,
to-day, this minute! I am alone in the world! They would let me in! Do
you think they wouldnâ€™t? Youâ€™re wrong, I will get in! I will get in!
You reckoned on her meekness! You relied upon that! But I am not so
submissive, let me tell you! Youâ€™ve gone too far yourself. Search her,
NA
And Katerina Ivanovna in a frenzy shook Luzhin and dragged him towards
Sonia.
â€œI am ready, Iâ€™ll be responsible... but calm yourself, madam, calm
yourself. I see that you are not so submissive!... Well, well, but as to
NA
indeed there are witnesses enough as it is.... I am ready.... But in
any case itâ€™s difficult for a man... on account of her sex.... But with
the help of Amalia Ivanovna... though, of course, itâ€™s not the way to do

NA
â€œSonia, turn out your pockets! See! Look, monster, the pocket is empty,
here was her handkerchief! Here is the other pocket, look! Dâ€™you see,
NA
And Katerina Ivanovna turned--or rather snatched--both pockets inside
out. But from the right pocket a piece of paper flew out and describing
a parabola in the air fell at Luzhinâ€™s feet. Everyone saw it, several
cried out. Pyotr Petrovitch stooped down, picked up the paper in two
fingers, lifted it where all could see it and opened it. It was a
hundred-rouble note folded in eight. Pyotr Petrovitch held up the note
showing it to everyone.
NA
NA
Exclamations arose on all sides. Raskolnikov was silent, keeping his
eyes fixed on Sonia, except for an occasional rapid glance at Luzhin.
Sonia stood still, as though unconscious. She was hardly able to feel
surprise. Suddenly the colour rushed to her cheeks; she uttered a cry
and hid her face in her hands.
NA
with a heartrending wail, and she ran to Katerina Ivanovna, who clasped
her tightly in her arms, as though she would shelter her from all the
world.
NA
cried in the face of the obvious fact, swaying her to and fro in her
arms like a baby, kissing her face continually, then snatching at her
hands and kissing them, too, â€œyou took it! How stupid these people are!
NA
â€œyou donâ€™t know, you donâ€™t know what a heart she has, what a girl she
is! She take it, she? Sheâ€™d sell her last rag, sheâ€™d go barefoot to help
you if you needed it, thatâ€™s what she is! She has the yellow passport
because my children were starving, she sold herself for us! Ah, husband,
husband! Do you see? Do you see? What a memorial dinner for you!
Merciful heavens! Defend her, why are you all standing still? Rodion
Romanovitch, why donâ€™t you stand up for her? Do you believe it, too? You
are not worth her little finger, all of you together! Good God! Defend
NA
The wail of the poor, consumptive, helpless woman seemed to produce a
great effect on her audience. The agonised, wasted, consumptive face,
the parched blood-stained lips, the hoarse voice, the tears unrestrained
as a childâ€™s, the trustful, childish and yet despairing prayer for help
were so piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her. Pyotr Petrovitch
at any rate was at once moved to _compassion_.
NA
impressively, â€œno one would take upon himself to accuse you of being an
instigator or even an accomplice in it, especially as you have proved
her guilt by turning out her pockets, showing that you had no previous
idea of it. I am most ready, most ready to show compassion, if poverty,
so to speak, drove Sofya Semyonovna to it, but why did you refuse to
confess, mademoiselle? Were you afraid of the disgrace? The first step?
You lost your head, perhaps? One can quite understand it.... But how

addressed the whole company, â€œgentlemen! Compassionate and, so to say,
commiserating these people, I am ready to overlook it even now in spite
of the personal insult lavished upon me! And may this disgrace be a

NA
Pyotr Petrovitch stole a glance at Raskolnikov. Their eyes met, and the
fire in Raskolnikovâ€™s seemed ready to reduce him to ashes. Meanwhile
Katerina Ivanovna apparently heard nothing. She was kissing and hugging
Sonia like a madwoman. The children, too, were embracing Sonia on
all sides, and Polenka--though she did not fully understand what was
wrong--was drowned in tears and shaking with sobs, as she hid her pretty
little face, swollen with weeping, on Soniaâ€™s shoulder.

Pyotr Petrovitch looked round quickly.

Pyotr Petrovitch gave a positive start--all noticed it and recalled it
afterwards. Lebeziatnikov strode into the room.

Petrovitch.

NA
 Lebeziatnikov said hotly, looking sternly at him with his short-sighted
eyes.
He was extremely angry. Raskolnikov gazed intently at him, as though
seizing and weighing each word. Again there was a silence. Pyotr
Petrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment.
NA
NA
â€œIâ€™m in my mind, but you are a scoundrel! Ah, how vile! I have heard
everything. I kept waiting on purpose to understand it, for I must own
even now it is not quite logical.... What you have done it all for I

â€œWhy, what have I done then? Give over talking in your nonsensical

â€œYou may be a drunkard, perhaps, vile man, but I am not! I never touch

 repeated Lebeziatnikov, addressing all.

my principles, I am ready this very minute to take any oath you like
before the court, for I saw how you slipped it in her pocket. Only
like a fool I thought you did it out of kindness! When you were saying
good-bye to her at the door, while you held her hand in one hand, with
the other, the left, you slipped the note into her pocket. I saw it, I

Luzhin turned pale.

NA
â€œNo, I didnâ€™t fancy it. And though I was standing some way off, I saw
it all. And though it certainly would be hard to distinguish a note from
the window--thatâ€™s true--I knew for certain that it was a hundred-rouble
note, because, when you were going to give Sofya Semyonovna ten roubles,
you took up from the table a hundred-rouble note (I saw it because I
was standing near then, and an idea struck me at once, so that I did not
forget you had it in your hand). You folded it and kept it in your hand
all the time. I didnâ€™t think of it again until, when you were getting
up, you changed it from your right hand to your left and nearly dropped
it! I noticed it because the same idea struck me again, that you meant
to do her a kindness without my seeing. You can fancy how I watched you
and I saw how you succeeded in slipping it into her pocket. I saw it, I

Lebeziatnikov was almost breathless. Exclamations arose on all hands
chiefly expressive of wonder, but some were menacing in tone. They all
crowded round Pyotr Petrovitch. Katerina Ivanovna flew to Lebeziatnikov.
â€œI was mistaken in you! Protect her! You are the only one to take her
NA
Katerina Ivanovna, hardly knowing what she was doing, sank on her knees
before him.
NA
youâ€™ve been talking! â€˜An idea struck you, you didnâ€™t think, you
noticedâ€™--what does it amount to? So I gave it to her on the sly on
NA
â€œWhat for? Thatâ€™s what I canâ€™t understand, but that what I am telling
you is the fact, thatâ€™s certain! So far from my being mistaken, you
infamous criminal man, I remember how, on account of it, a question
occurred to me at once, just when I was thanking you and pressing
your hand. What made you put it secretly in her pocket? Why you did it
secretly, I mean? Could it be simply to conceal it from me, knowing that
my convictions are opposed to yours and that I do not approve of private
benevolence, which effects no radical cure? Well, I decided that you
really were ashamed of giving such a large sum before me. Perhaps,
too, I thought, he wants to give her a surprise, when she finds a whole
hundred-rouble note in her pocket. (For I know, some benevolent people
are very fond of decking out their charitable actions in that way.) Then
the idea struck me, too, that you wanted to test her, to see whether,
when she found it, she would come to thank you. Then, too, that you
wanted to avoid thanks and that, as the saying is, your right hand
should not know... something of that sort, in fact. I thought of so
many possibilities that I put off considering it, but still thought it
indelicate to show you that I knew your secret. But another idea struck
me again that Sofya Semyonovna might easily lose the money before she
noticed it, that was why I decided to come in here to call her out of
the room and to tell her that you put a hundred roubles in her pocket.
But on my way I went first to Madame Kobilatnikovâ€™s to take them the
â€˜General Treatise on the Positive Methodâ€™ and especially to recommend
Pideritâ€™s article (and also Wagnerâ€™s); then I come on here and what a
state of things I find! Now could I, could I, have all these ideas and
reflections if I had not seen you put the hundred-rouble note in her

When Lebeziatnikov finished his long-winded harangue with the logical
deduction at the end, he was quite tired, and the perspiration streamed
from his face. He could not, alas, even express himself correctly
in Russian, though he knew no other language, so that he was quite
exhausted, almost emaciated after this heroic exploit. But his speech
produced a powerful effect. He had spoken with such vehemence, with such
conviction that everyone obviously believed him. Pyotr Petrovitch felt
that things were going badly with him.
NA
â€œthatâ€™s no evidence. You may have dreamt it, thatâ€™s all! And I tell you,
you are lying, sir. You are lying and slandering from some spite against
me, simply from pique, because I did not agree with your free-thinking,
NA
But this retort did not benefit Pyotr Petrovitch. Murmurs of disapproval
were heard on all sides.
NA
nonsense! Call the police and Iâ€™ll take my oath! Thereâ€™s only one thing
I canâ€™t understand: what made him risk such a contemptible action. Oh,
NA
â€œI can explain why he risked such an action, and if necessary, I, too,
NA
stepped forward.
He appeared to be firm and composed. Everyone felt clearly, from the
very look of him that he really knew about it and that the mystery would
be solved.
NA
Lebeziatnikov. â€œFrom the very beginning of the business, I suspected
that there was some scoundrelly intrigue at the bottom of it. I began
to suspect it from some special circumstances known to me only, which
I will explain at once to everyone: they account for everything. Your
valuable evidence has finally made everything clear to me. I beg all,
all to listen. This gentleman (he pointed to Luzhin) was recently
engaged to be married to a young lady--my sister, Avdotya Romanovna
Raskolnikov. But coming to Petersburg he quarrelled with me, the day
before yesterday, at our first meeting and I drove him out of my room--I
have two witnesses to prove it. He is a very spiteful man.... The day
before yesterday I did not know that he was staying here, in your room,
and that consequently on the very day we quarrelled--the day before
yesterday--he saw me give Katerina Ivanovna some money for the funeral,
as a friend of the late Mr. Marmeladov. He at once wrote a note to
my mother and informed her that I had given away all my money, not
to Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna, and referred in a most
contemptible way to the... character of Sofya Semyonovna, that is,
hinted at the character of my attitude to Sofya Semyonovna. All this you
understand was with the object of dividing me from my mother and sister,
by insinuating that I was squandering on unworthy objects the money
which they had sent me and which was all they had. Yesterday evening,
before my mother and sister and in his presence, I declared that I had
given the money to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral and not to Sofya
Semyonovna and that I had no acquaintance with Sofya Semyonovna and had
never seen her before, indeed. At the same time I added that he,
Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, with all his virtues, was not worth Sofya
Semyonovnaâ€™s little finger, though he spoke so ill of her. To his
question--would I let Sofya Semyonovna sit down beside my sister, I
answered that I had already done so that day. Irritated that my mother
and sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insinuations, he
gradually began being unpardonably rude to them. A final rupture took
place and he was turned out of the house. All this happened yesterday
evening. Now I beg your special attention: consider: if he had now
succeeded in proving that Sofya Semyonovna was a thief, he would
have shown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in his
suspicions, that he had reason to be angry at my putting my sister on
a level with Sofya Semyonovna, that, in attacking me, he was protecting
and preserving the honour of my sister, his betrothed. In fact he might
even, through all this, have been able to estrange me from my family,
and no doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them; to say nothing
of revenging himself on me personally, for he has grounds for supposing
that the honour and happiness of Sofya Semyonovna are very precious to
me. That was what he was working for! Thatâ€™s how I understand it. Thatâ€™s
NA
It was like this, or somewhat like this, that Raskolnikov wound up his
speech which was followed very attentively, though often interrupted by
exclamations from his audience. But in spite of interruptions he spoke
clearly, calmly, exactly, firmly. His decisive voice, his tone of
conviction and his stern face made a great impression on everyone.
NA
it, for he asked me, as soon as Sofya Semyonovna came into our room,
whether you were here, whether I had seen you among Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s
guests. He called me aside to the window and asked me in secret. It was
NA
Luzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak. But he was very pale. He
seemed to be deliberating on some means of escape. Perhaps he would have
been glad to give up everything and get away, but at the moment this
was scarcely possible. It would have implied admitting the truth of
the accusations brought against him. Moreover, the company, which had
already been excited by drink, was now too much stirred to allow it. The
commissariat clerk, though indeed he had not grasped the whole position,
was shouting louder than anyone and was making some suggestions very
unpleasant to Luzhin. But not all those present were drunk; lodgers came
in from all the rooms. The three Poles were tremendously excited
NA
muttering threats in Polish. Sonia had been listening with strained
attention, though she too seemed unable to grasp it all; she seemed as
though she had just returned to consciousness. She did not take her
eyes off Raskolnikov, feeling that all her safety lay in him. Katerina
Ivanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearfully exhausted.
Amalia Ivanovna stood looking more stupid than anyone, with her mouth
wide open, unable to make out what had happened. She only saw that Pyotr
Petrovitch had somehow come to grief.
Raskolnikov was attempting to speak again, but they did not let him.
Everyone was crowding round Luzhin with threats and shouts of abuse.
But Pyotr Petrovitch was not intimidated. Seeing that his accusation of
Sonia had completely failed, he had recourse to insolence:
NA
making his way through the crowd. â€œAnd no threats, if you please! I
assure you it will be useless, you will gain nothing by it. On the
contrary, youâ€™ll have to answer, gentlemen, for violently obstructing
the course of justice. The thief has been more than unmasked, and I
shall prosecute. Our judges are not so blind and... not so drunk, and
will not believe the testimony of two notorious infidels, agitators, and
atheists, who accuse me from motives of personal revenge which they are
NA
â€œDonâ€™t let me find a trace of you in my room! Kindly leave at once, and
everything is at an end between us! When I think of the trouble Iâ€™ve
NA
â€œI told you myself to-day that I was going, when you tried to keep me;
now I will simply add that you are a fool. I advise you to see a doctor
NA
He forced his way through. But the commissariat clerk was unwilling to
let him off so easily: he picked up a glass from the table, brandished
it in the air and flung it at Pyotr Petrovitch; but the glass flew
straight at Amalia Ivanovna. She screamed, and the clerk, overbalancing,
fell heavily under the table. Pyotr Petrovitch made his way to his room
and half an hour later had left the house. Sonia, timid by nature, had
felt before that day that she could be ill-treated more easily than
anyone, and that she could be wronged with impunity. Yet till that
moment she had fancied that she might escape misfortune by care,
gentleness and submissiveness before everyone. Her disappointment was
too great. She could, of course, bear with patience and almost without
murmur anything, even this. But for the first minute she felt it too
bitter. In spite of her triumph and her justification--when her first
terror and stupefaction had passed and she could understand it all
clearly--the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to her
made her heart throb with anguish and she was overcome with hysterical
weeping. At last, unable to bear any more, she rushed out of the room
and ran home, almost immediately after Luzhinâ€™s departure. When amidst
loud laughter the glass flew at Amalia Ivanovna, it was more than the
landlady could endure. With a shriek she rushed like a fury at Katerina
Ivanovna, considering her to blame for everything.
NA
And with these words she began snatching up everything she could lay
her hands on that belonged to Katerina Ivanovna, and throwing it on the
floor. Katerina Ivanovna, pale, almost fainting, and gasping for breath,
jumped up from the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and darted at
Amalia Ivanovna. But the battle was too unequal: the landlady waved her
away like a feather.
â€œWhat! As though that godless calumny was not enough--this vile creature
attacks me! What! On the day of my husbandâ€™s funeral I am turned out of
my lodging! After eating my bread and salt she turns me into the street,
NA
NA
upon earth? Whom should you protect if not us orphans? We shall see!
There is law and justice on earth, there is, I will find it! Wait a bit,
godless creature! Polenka, stay with the children, Iâ€™ll come back. Wait
for me, if you have to wait in the street. We will see whether there is
NA
And throwing over her head that green shawl which Marmeladov had
mentioned to Raskolnikov, Katerina Ivanovna squeezed her way through the
disorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room, and,
wailing and tearful, she ran into the street--with a vague intention
of going at once somewhere to find justice. Polenka with the two little
ones in her arms crouched, terrified, on the trunk in the corner of the
room, where she waited trembling for her mother to come back. Amalia
Ivanovna raged about the room, shrieking, lamenting and throwing
everything she came across on the floor. The lodgers talked
incoherently, some commented to the best of their ability on what had
happened, others quarrelled and swore at one another, while others
struck up a song....
NA
NA
And he set off in the direction of Soniaâ€™s lodgings.
CHAPTER IV
Raskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion of Sonia against
Luzhin, although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his own
heart. But having gone through so much in the morning, he found a sort
of relief in a change of sensations, apart from the strong personal
feeling which impelled him to defend Sonia. He was agitated too,
especially at some moments, by the thought of his approaching interview
with Sonia: he _had_ to tell her who had killed Lizaveta. He knew the
terrible suffering it would be to him and, as it were, brushed away the
thought of it. So when he cried as he left Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s, â€œWell,
NA
superficially excited, still vigorous and defiant from his triumph over
Luzhin. But, strange to say, by the time he reached Soniaâ€™s lodging, he
felt a sudden impotence and fear. He stood still in hesitation at the
door, asking himself the strange question: â€œMust he tell her who killed
NA
not only that he could not help telling her, but also that he could
not put off the telling. He did not yet know why it must be so, he
only _felt_ it, and the agonising sense of his impotence before
the inevitable almost crushed him. To cut short his hesitation and
suffering, he quickly opened the door and looked at Sonia from the
doorway. She was sitting with her elbows on the table and her face in
her hands, but seeing Raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet
him as though she were expecting him.
NA
him in the middle of the room.
Evidently she was in haste to say this to him. It was what she had been
waiting for.
Raskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she
had only just risen. She stood facing him, two steps away, just as she
had done the day before.

Her face showed her distress.
NA

She made haste to smile, afraid that he might not like the reproach.
â€œI was silly to come away from there. What is happening there now? I

He told her that Amalia Ivanovna was turning them out of their lodging
NA
NA
And she snatched up her cape.
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou wonâ€™t lose Katerina Ivanovna, you may be sure, sheâ€™ll come to you
NA
NA
Sonia sat down in painful suspense. Raskolnikov was silent, gazing at
the floor and deliberating.
NA
at Sonia, â€œbut if he had wanted to, if it had suited his plans, he would
have sent you to prison if it had not been for Lebeziatnikov and me.
NA
NA
and distressed.
â€œBut I might easily not have been there. And it was quite an accident
NA
Sonia was silent.
â€œAnd if youâ€™d gone to prison, what then? Do you remember what I said
NA
Again she did not answer. He waited.
NA
 Raskolnikov gave a laugh, but rather a forced one. â€œWhat, silence
NA
know. It would be interesting for me to know how you would decide a
NA
the thread.) â€œNo, really, I am serious. Imagine, Sonia, that you had
known all Luzhinâ€™s intentions beforehand. Known, that is, for a fact,
that they would be the ruin of Katerina Ivanovna and the children and
yourself thrown in--since you donâ€™t count yourself for anything--Polenka
too... for sheâ€™ll go the same way. Well, if suddenly it all depended on
your decision whether he or they should go on living, that is whether
Luzhin should go on living and doing wicked things, or Katerina Ivanovna
NA
Sonia looked uneasily at him. There was something peculiar in this
hesitating question, which seemed approaching something in a roundabout
way.
NA
looking inquisitively at him.
NA
NA
â€œThen it would be better for Luzhin to go on living and doing wicked
NA
â€œBut I canâ€™t know the Divine Providence.... And why do you ask what
canâ€™t be answered? Whatâ€™s the use of such foolish questions? How could
it happen that it should depend on my decision--who has made me a judge
NA
â€œOh, if the Divine Providence is to be mixed up in it, there is no doing

NA
â€œYou are leading up to something again.... Can you have come simply to

She could not control herself and began crying bitterly. He looked at
her in gloomy misery. Five minutes passed.
NA
changed. His tone of assumed arrogance and helpless defiance was gone.
Even his voice was suddenly weak. â€œI told you yesterday that I was not
coming to ask forgiveness and almost the first thing Iâ€™ve said is to ask
forgiveness.... I said that about Luzhin and Providence for my own sake.
NA
He tried to smile, but there was something helpless and incomplete in
his pale smile. He bowed his head and hid his face in his hands.
And suddenly a strange, surprising sensation of a sort of bitter hatred
for Sonia passed through his heart. As it were wondering and frightened
of this sensation, he raised his head and looked intently at her; but he
met her uneasy and painfully anxious eyes fixed on him; there was
love in them; his hatred vanished like a phantom. It was not the real
feeling; he had taken the one feeling for the other. It only meant that
_that_ minute had come.
He hid his face in his hands again and bowed his head. Suddenly he
turned pale, got up from his chair, looked at Sonia, and without
uttering a word sat down mechanically on her bed.
His sensations that moment were terribly like the moment when he had
stood over the old woman with the axe in his hand and felt that â€œhe must

NA
He could not utter a word. This was not at all, not at all the way he
NA
him now. She went up to him, softly, sat down on the bed beside him and
waited, not taking her eyes off him. Her heart throbbed and sank. It
was unendurable; he turned his deadly pale face to her. His lips worked,
helplessly struggling to utter something. A pang of terror passed
through Soniaâ€™s heart.
NA
â€œNothing, Sonia, donâ€™t be frightened.... Itâ€™s nonsense. It really is

NA
NA
He had perhaps been asking himself that question a quarter of an hour
before, but now he spoke helplessly, hardly knowing what he said and
feeling a continual tremor all over.
NA
at him.
NA
helpless smile for two seconds. â€œYou remember what I meant to tell you
NA
Sonia waited uneasily.
â€œI said as I went away that perhaps I was saying good-bye for ever, but
NA
She began trembling all over.
NA
NA
NA
reason.
Soniaâ€™s face grew paler and paler, and she breathed painfully.
NA
She paused a minute.
NA
NA
NA
again after a minuteâ€™s pause.
He turned to her and looked very intently at her.
NA
A shudder passed over her.
NA

NA
on, still gazing into her face, as though he could not turn his eyes
away. â€œHe... did not mean to kill that Lizaveta... he... killed her
accidentally.... He meant to kill the old woman when she was alone and
NA
Another awful moment passed. Both still gazed at one another.
NA
flinging himself down from a steeple.
NA
NA
As soon as he had said this again, the same familiar sensation froze his
heart. He looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face the
face of Lizaveta. He remembered clearly the expression in Lizavetaâ€™s
face, when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the
wall, putting out her hand, with childish terror in her face, looking
as little children do when they begin to be frightened of something,
looking intently and uneasily at what frightens them, shrinking back and
holding out their little hands on the point of crying. Almost the same
thing happened now to Sonia. With the same helplessness and the same
terror, she looked at him for a while and, suddenly putting out her left
hand, pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began to
get up from the bed, moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixed
even more immovably on him. Her terror infected him. The same fear
showed itself on his face. In the same way he stared at her and almost
with the same _childish_ smile.
NA
NA
She sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pillows, but a
moment later she got up, moved quickly to him, seized both his hands
and, gripping them tight in her thin fingers, began looking into his
face again with the same intent stare. In this last desperate look she
tried to look into him and catch some last hope. But there was no hope;
there was no doubt remaining; it was all true! Later on, indeed, when
she recalled that moment, she thought it strange and wondered why she
had seen at once that there was no doubt. She could not have said, for
instance, that she had foreseen something of the sort--and yet now, as
soon as he told her, she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen
this very thing.
NA
It was not at all, not at all like this he had thought of telling her,
but this is how it happened.
She jumped up, seeming not to know what she was doing, and, wringing her
hands, walked into the middle of the room; but quickly went back and sat
down again beside him, her shoulder almost touching his. All of a sudden
she started as though she had been stabbed, uttered a cry and fell on
her knees before him, she did not know why.
NA
despair, and, jumping up, she flung herself on his neck, threw her arms
round him, and held him tightly.
Raskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mournful smile.
â€œYou are a strange girl, Sonia--you kiss me and hug me when I tell you
NA
NA
cried in a frenzy, not hearing what he said, and she suddenly broke into
violent hysterical weeping.
A feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and softened it at
once. He did not struggle against it. Two tears started into his eyes
and hung on his eyelashes.
NA
hope.
NA
you everywhere. Oh, my God! Oh, how miserable I am!... Why, why didnâ€™t I
NA
NA
NA
as it were unconsciously, and she hugged him again. â€œIâ€™ll follow you to
NA
He recoiled at this, and the same hostile, almost haughty smile came to
his lips.
NA
Sonia looked at him quickly.
Again after her first passionate, agonising sympathy for the unhappy man
the terrible idea of the murder overwhelmed her. In his changed tone she
seemed to hear the murderer speaking. She looked at him bewildered. She
knew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been. Now all
these questions rushed at once into her mind. And again she could not
NA
NA
bewilderment, as though still unable to recover herself. â€œHow could you,
you, a man like you.... How could you bring yourself to it?... What does
NA
NA
with vexation.
Sonia stood as though struck dumb, but suddenly she cried:
NA
NA
not so hungry.... I certainly did want to help my mother, but... thatâ€™s
NA
Sonia clasped her hands.
â€œCould it, could it all be true? Good God, what a truth! Who could
believe it? And how could you give away your last farthing and yet
NA
NA
NA
yourself! That money my mother sent me and it came when I was ill, the
day I gave it to you.... Razumihin saw it... he received it for me....
NA
Sonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her utmost to comprehend.
â€œAnd _that_ money.... I donâ€™t even know really whether there was any
NA
neck, made of chamois leather... a purse stuffed full of something...
but I didnâ€™t look in it; I suppose I hadnâ€™t time.... And the
things--chains and trinkets--I buried under a stone with the purse next
NA
Sonia strained every nerve to listen.
NA
asked quickly, catching at a straw.
â€œI donâ€™t know.... I havenâ€™t yet decided whether to take that money or
NA
NA
The thought flashed through Soniaâ€™s mind, wasnâ€™t he mad? But she
NA
nothing of it, nothing.
NA
NA
every word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her, â€œI should
NA
cried a moment later with a sort of despair, â€œwhat would it matter to
you if I were to confess that I did wrong? What do you gain by such
a stupid triumph over me? Ah, Sonia, was it for that Iâ€™ve come to you
NA
Again Sonia tried to say something, but did not speak.
NA
NA
NA
â€œWe are so different.... And you know, Sonia, itâ€™s only now, only this
moment that I understand _where_ I asked you to go with me yesterday!
Yesterday when I said it I did not know where. I asked you for one
thing, I came to you for one thing--not to leave me. You wonâ€™t leave me,
NA
She squeezed his hand.
NA
later in despair, looking with infinite anguish at her. â€œHere you expect
an explanation from me, Sonia; you are sitting and waiting for it, I see
that. But what can I tell you? You wonâ€™t understand and will only suffer
misery... on my account! Well, you are crying and embracing me again.
Why do you do it? Because I couldnâ€™t bear my burden and have come to
throw it on another: you suffer too, and I shall feel better! And can
NA
NA
Again a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart, and again for an
instant softened it.
â€œSonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that. It may explain a great
deal. I have come because I am bad. There are men who wouldnâ€™t have
come. But I am a coward and... a mean wretch. But... never mind! Thatâ€™s
NA
He paused and sank into thought.
NA
NA
NA
NA
He looked at her with anguish.
NA
â€œYes, thatâ€™s what it was! I wanted to become a Napoleon, that is why I
NA
NA
NA
NA
time lost in meditation.
â€œIt was like this: I asked myself one day this question--what if
Napoleon, for instance, had happened to be in my place, and if he had
not had Toulon nor Egypt nor the passage of Mont Blanc to begin his
career with, but instead of all those picturesque and monumental things,
there had simply been some ridiculous old hag, a pawnbroker, who had
to be murdered too to get money from her trunk (for his career, you
understand). Well, would he have brought himself to that if there had
been no other means? Wouldnâ€™t he have felt a pang at its being so far
from monumental and... and sinful, too? Well, I must tell you that I
worried myself fearfully over that â€˜questionâ€™ so that I was awfully
ashamed when I guessed at last (all of a sudden, somehow) that it would
not have given him the least pang, that it would not even have struck
him that it was not monumental... that he would not have seen that there
was anything in it to pause over, and that, if he had had no other way,
he would have strangled her in a minute without thinking about it!
Well, I too... left off thinking about it... murdered her, following
his example. And thatâ€™s exactly how it was! Do you think it funny? Yes,
Sonia, the funniest thing of all is that perhaps thatâ€™s just how it
NA
Sonia did not think it at all funny.
NA
still more timidly and scarcely audibly.
He turned to her, looked sadly at her and took her hands.
â€œYou are right again, Sonia. Of course thatâ€™s all nonsense, itâ€™s almost
all talk! You see, you know of course that my mother has scarcely
anything, my sister happened to have a good education and was condemned
to drudge as a governess. All their hopes were centered on me. I was a
student, but I couldnâ€™t keep myself at the university and was forced
for a time to leave it. Even if I had lingered on like that, in ten
or twelve years I might (with luck) hope to be some sort of teacher or
NA
were a lesson) â€œand by that time my mother would be worn out with grief
and anxiety and I could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while my
sister... well, my sister might well have fared worse! And itâ€™s a hard
thing to pass everything by all oneâ€™s life, to turn oneâ€™s back upon
everything, to forget oneâ€™s mother and decorously accept the insults
inflicted on oneâ€™s sister. Why should one? When one has buried them to
burden oneself with others--wife and children--and to leave them again
without a farthing? So I resolved to gain possession of the old womanâ€™s
money and to use it for my first years without worrying my mother,
to keep myself at the university and for a little while after leaving
it--and to do this all on a broad, thorough scale, so as to build up
a completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence....
Well... thatâ€™s all.... Well, of course in killing the old woman I did
NA
He struggled to the end of his speech in exhaustion and let his head
sink.
NA
NA
â€œYou see yourself that itâ€™s not right. But Iâ€™ve spoken truly, itâ€™s the
NA
NA
â€œIâ€™ve only killed a louse, Sonia, a useless, loathsome, harmful
NA
NA
NA
NA
nonsense a long time.... Thatâ€™s not it, you are right there. There were
quite, quite other causes for it! I havenâ€™t talked to anyone for so
NA
His eyes shone with feverish brilliance. He was almost delirious; an
uneasy smile strayed on his lips. His terrible exhaustion could be seen
through his excitement. Sonia saw how he was suffering. She too
was growing dizzy. And he talked so strangely; it seemed somehow
NA
hands in despair.
NA
as though a new and sudden train of thought had struck and as it were
roused him--â€œthatâ€™s not it! Better... imagine--yes, itâ€™s certainly
better--imagine that I am vain, envious, malicious, base, vindictive
and... well, perhaps with a tendency to insanity. (Letâ€™s have it all out
at once! Theyâ€™ve talked of madness already, I noticed.) I told you just
now I could not keep myself at the university. But do you know that
perhaps I might have done? My mother would have sent me what I needed
for the fees and I could have earned enough for clothes, boots and food,
no doubt. Lessons had turned up at half a rouble. Razumihin works! But I
turned sulky and wouldnâ€™t. (Yes, sulkiness, thatâ€™s the right word for
it!) I sat in my room like a spider. Youâ€™ve been in my den, youâ€™ve seen
it.... And do you know, Sonia, that low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp
the soul and the mind? Ah, how I hated that garret! And yet I wouldnâ€™t
go out of it! I wouldnâ€™t on purpose! I didnâ€™t go out for days together,
and I wouldnâ€™t work, I wouldnâ€™t even eat, I just lay there doing
nothing. If Nastasya brought me anything, I ate it, if she didnâ€™t, I
went all day without; I wouldnâ€™t ask, on purpose, from sulkiness! At
night I had no light, I lay in the dark and I wouldnâ€™t earn money for
candles. I ought to have studied, but I sold my books; and the dust lies
an inch thick on the notebooks on my table. I preferred lying still and
thinking. And I kept thinking.... And I had dreams all the time, strange
dreams of all sorts, no need to describe! Only then I began to fancy
that... No, thatâ€™s not it! Again I am telling you wrong! You see I kept
asking myself then: why am I so stupid that if others are stupid--and I
know they are--yet I wonâ€™t be wiser? Then I saw, Sonia, that if one
waits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long.... Afterwards I
understood that that would never come to pass, that men wonâ€™t change and
that nobody can alter it and that itâ€™s not worth wasting effort over it.
Yes, thatâ€™s so. Thatâ€™s the law of their nature, Sonia,... thatâ€™s so!...
And I know now, Sonia, that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will
have power over them. Anyone who is greatly daring is right in their
eyes. He who despises most things will be a lawgiver among them and he
who dares most of all will be most in the right! So it has been till now
NA
Though Raskolnikov looked at Sonia as he said this, he no longer cared
whether she understood or not. The fever had complete hold of him; he
was in a sort of gloomy ecstasy (he certainly had been too long without
talking to anyone). Sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his
faith and code.
NA
vouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up. There is only
one thing, one thing needful: one has only to dare! Then for the first
time in my life an idea took shape in my mind which no one had ever
thought of before me, no one! I saw clear as daylight how strange it is
that not a single person living in this mad world has had the daring to
go straight for it all and send it flying to the devil! I... I wanted
_to have the daring_... and I killed her. I only wanted to have the

NA
NA
â€œThen Sonia, when I used to lie there in the dark and all this became
NA
â€œHush, donâ€™t laugh, blasphemer! You donâ€™t understand, you donâ€™t
NA
â€œHush, Sonia! I am not laughing. I know myself that it was the devil
NA
know it all, I have thought it all over and over and whispered it all
over to myself, lying there in the dark.... Iâ€™ve argued it all over with
myself, every point of it, and I know it all, all! And how sick, how
sick I was then of going over it all! I have kept wanting to forget it
and make a new beginning, Sonia, and leave off thinking. And you donâ€™t
suppose that I went into it headlong like a fool? I went into it like a
wise man, and that was just my destruction. And you mustnâ€™t suppose that
I didnâ€™t know, for instance, that if I began to question myself whether
I had the right to gain power--I certainly hadnâ€™t the right--or that if
I asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasnâ€™t
so for me, though it might be for a man who would go straight to his
goal without asking questions.... If I worried myself all those days,
wondering whether Napoleon would have done it or not, I felt clearly
of course that I wasnâ€™t Napoleon. I had to endure all the agony of that
battle of ideas, Sonia, and I longed to throw it off: I wanted to murder
without casuistry, to murder for my own sake, for myself alone! I didnâ€™t
want to lie about it even to myself. It wasnâ€™t to help my mother I did
the murder--thatâ€™s nonsense--I didnâ€™t do the murder to gain wealth and
power and to become a benefactor of mankind. Nonsense! I simply did it;
I did the murder for myself, for myself alone, and whether I became a
benefactor to others, or spent my life like a spider catching men in
my web and sucking the life out of men, I couldnâ€™t have cared at that
moment.... And it was not the money I wanted, Sonia, when I did it. It
was not so much the money I wanted, but something else.... I know it all
now.... Understand me! Perhaps I should never have committed a murder
again. I wanted to find out something else; it was something else led
me on. I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louse
like everybody else or a man. Whether I can step over barriers or
not, whether I dare stoop to pick up or not, whether I am a trembling

NA
NA
but was contemptuously silent. â€œDonâ€™t interrupt me, Sonia. I want to
prove one thing only, that the devil led me on then and he has shown me
since that I had not the right to take that path, because I am just such
a louse as all the rest. He was mocking me and here Iâ€™ve come to you
now! Welcome your guest! If I were not a louse, should I have come to
you? Listen: when I went then to the old womanâ€™s I only went to
NA
NA
â€œBut how did I murder her? Is that how men do murders? Do men go to
commit a murder as I went then? I will tell you some day how I went!
Did I murder the old woman? I murdered myself, not her! I crushed myself
once for all, for ever.... But it was the devil that killed that old

earth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say
to all men aloud, â€˜I am a murderer!â€™ Then God will send you life again.

his two hands, squeezing them tight in hers and gazing at him with eyes
full of fire.
He was amazed at her sudden ecstasy.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œhow is it possible now? Why, how can you talk to your mother? (Oh, what
will become of them now?) But what am I saying? You have abandoned your
mother and your sister already. He has abandoned them already! Oh,

â€œWhy, they would laugh at me, and would call me a fool for not getting

A haughty smile appeared on his lips.

NA
â€œWell, why do you cry out? You want me to go to Siberia and now you are
frightened? But let me tell you: I shall not give myself up. I shall
make a struggle for it and they wonâ€™t do anything to me. Theyâ€™ve no real
evidence. Yesterday I was in great danger and believed I was lost; but
to-day things are going better. All the facts they know can be explained
two ways, thatâ€™s to say I can turn their accusations to my credit, do
you understand? And I shall, for Iâ€™ve learnt my lesson. But they will
certainly arrest me. If it had not been for something that happened,
they would have done so to-day for certain; perhaps even now they will
arrest me to-day.... But thatâ€™s no matter, Sonia; theyâ€™ll let me out
again... for there isnâ€™t any real proof against me, and there wonâ€™t be,
I give you my word for it. And they canâ€™t convict a man on what they
have against me. Enough.... I only tell you that you may know.... I will
try to manage somehow to put it to my mother and sister so that they
wonâ€™t be frightened.... My sisterâ€™s future is secure, however, now, I
believe... and my motherâ€™s must be too.... Well, thatâ€™s all. Be careful,
NA
NA
They sat side by side, both mournful and dejected, as though they had
been cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore. He looked at
Sonia and felt how great was her love for him, and strange to say he
felt it suddenly burdensome and painful to be so loved. Yes, it was a
strange and awful sensation! On his way to see Sonia he had felt that
all his hopes rested on her; he expected to be rid of at least part
of his suffering, and now, when all her heart turned towards him, he
suddenly felt that he was immeasurably unhappier than before.
NA
NA
Sonia did not answer, she was crying. Several minutes passed.
NA
He did not at first understand the question.
â€œNo, of course not. Here, take this one, of cypress wood. I have
another, a copper one that belonged to Lizaveta. I changed with
Lizaveta: she gave me her cross and I gave her my little ikon. I will
wear Lizavetaâ€™s now and give you this. Take it... itâ€™s mine! Itâ€™s mine,

He did not want to hurt her feelings. But immediately he drew back the
hand he held out for the cross.

At that moment someone knocked three times at the door.

Sonia rushed to the door in a fright. The flaxen head of Mr.
Lebeziatnikov appeared at the door.
CHAPTER V
Lebeziatnikov looked perturbed.
NA
NA
I didnâ€™t mean anything... of that sort... But I just thought... Katerina
NA
from Raskolnikov to Sonia.
Sonia screamed.
â€œAt least it seems so. But... we donâ€™t know what to do, you see! She
came back--she seems to have been turned out somewhere, perhaps
beaten.... So it seems at least,... She had run to your fatherâ€™s former
chief, she didnâ€™t find him at home: he was dining at some other
generalâ€™s.... Only fancy, she rushed off there, to the other generalâ€™s,
and, imagine, she was so persistent that she managed to get the chief to
see her, had him fetched out from dinner, it seems. You can imagine what
happened. She was turned out, of course; but, according to her own
story, she abused him and threw something at him. One may well believe
it.... How it is she wasnâ€™t taken up, I canâ€™t understand! Now she is
telling everyone, including Amalia Ivanovna; but itâ€™s difficult to
understand her, she is screaming and flinging herself about.... Oh yes,
she shouts that since everyone has abandoned her, she will take the
children and go into the street with a barrel-organ, and the children
will sing and dance, and she too, and collect money, and will go every
day under the generalâ€™s window... â€˜to let everyone see well-born
children, whose father was an official, begging in the street.â€™ She
keeps beating the children and they are all crying. She is teaching Lida
to sing â€˜My Village,â€™ the boy to dance, Polenka the same. She is tearing
up all the clothes, and making them little caps like actors; she means
to carry a tin basin and make it tinkle, instead of music.... She wonâ€™t
listen to anything.... Imagine the state of things! Itâ€™s beyond
NA
Lebeziatnikov would have gone on, but Sonia, who had heard him almost
breathless, snatched up her cloak and hat, and ran out of the room,
putting on her things as she went. Raskolnikov followed her and
Lebeziatnikov came after him.

into the street. â€œI didnâ€™t want to frighten Sofya Semyonovna, so I said
â€˜it seemed like it,â€™ but there isnâ€™t a doubt of it. They say that in
consumption the tubercles sometimes occur in the brain; itâ€™s a pity I
know nothing of medicine. I did try to persuade her, but she wouldnâ€™t

NA
â€œNot precisely of the tubercles. Besides, she wouldnâ€™t have understood!
But what I say is, that if you convince a person logically that he
has nothing to cry about, heâ€™ll stop crying. Thatâ€™s clear. Is it your

NA
â€œExcuse me, excuse me; of course it would be rather difficult for
Katerina Ivanovna to understand, but do you know that in Paris they have
been conducting serious experiments as to the possibility of curing the
insane, simply by logical argument? One professor there, a scientific
man of standing, lately dead, believed in the possibility of such
treatment. His idea was that thereâ€™s nothing really wrong with the
physical organism of the insane, and that insanity is, so to say, a
logical mistake, an error of judgment, an incorrect view of things. He
gradually showed the madman his error and, would you believe it, they
say he was successful? But as he made use of douches too, how far
success was due to that treatment remains uncertain.... So it seems at

Raskolnikov had long ceased to listen. Reaching the house where he
lived, he nodded to Lebeziatnikov and went in at the gate. Lebeziatnikov
woke up with a start, looked about him and hurried on.
Raskolnikov went into his little room and stood still in the middle
of it. Why had he come back here? He looked at the yellow and tattered
paper, at the dust, at his sofa.... From the yard came a loud continuous
knocking; someone seemed to be hammering... He went to the window, rose
on tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with an air of
absorbed attention. But the yard was empty and he could not see who was
hammering. In the house on the left he saw some open windows; on the
window-sills were pots of sickly-looking geraniums. Linen was hung out
of the windows... He knew it all by heart. He turned away and sat down
on the sofa.
Never, never had he felt himself so fearfully alone!
Yes, he felt once more that he would perhaps come to hate Sonia, now
that he had made her more miserable.
â€œWhy had he gone to her to beg for her tears? What need had he to poison
NA
NA
NA
Five minutes later he raised his head with a strange smile. That was a
strange thought.
NA
He could not have said how long he sat there with vague thoughts surging
through his mind. All at once the door opened and Dounia came in. At
first she stood still and looked at him from the doorway, just as he
had done at Sonia; then she came in and sat down in the same place
as yesterday, on the chair facing him. He looked silently and almost
vacantly at her.
NA
Her face looked thoughtful but not stern. Her eyes were bright and soft.
He saw that she too had come to him with love.
â€œBrother, now I know all, _all_. Dmitri Prokofitch has explained and
told me everything. They are worrying and persecuting you through a
stupid and contemptible suspicion.... Dmitri Prokofitch told me that
there is no danger, and that you are wrong in looking upon it with such
horror. I donâ€™t think so, and I fully understand how indignant you must
be, and that that indignation may have a permanent effect on you. Thatâ€™s
what I am afraid of. As for your cutting yourself off from us, I donâ€™t
judge you, I donâ€™t venture to judge you, and forgive me for having
blamed you for it. I feel that I too, if I had so great a trouble,
should keep away from everyone. I shall tell mother nothing _of this_,
but I shall talk about you continually and shall tell her from you that
you will come very soon. Donâ€™t worry about her; _I_ will set her mind at
rest; but donâ€™t you try her too much--come once at least; remember that

She turned abruptly and went towards the door.
NA
NA
Dounia flushed slightly.
NA
â€œHe is competent, hardworking, honest and capable of real love....
NA
Dounia flushed crimson, then suddenly she took alarm.
â€œBut what does it mean, brother? Are we really parting for ever that
NA
NA
He turned away, and walked to the window. She stood a moment, looked at
him uneasily, and went out troubled.
No, he was not cold to her. There was an instant (the very last one)
when he had longed to take her in his arms and _say good-bye_ to her,
and even _to tell_ her, but he had not dared even to touch her hand.
â€œAfterwards she may shudder when she remembers that I embraced her, and
NA
NA
himself. â€œNo, she wouldnâ€™t; girls like that canâ€™t stand things! They
NA
And he thought of Sonia.
There was a breath of fresh air from the window. The daylight was
fading. He took up his cap and went out.
He could not, of course, and would not consider how ill he was. But all
this continual anxiety and agony of mind could not but affect him. And
if he were not lying in high fever it was perhaps just because this
continual inner strain helped to keep him on his legs and in possession
of his faculties. But this artificial excitement could not last long.
He wandered aimlessly. The sun was setting. A special form of misery had
begun to oppress him of late. There was nothing poignant, nothing acute
about it; but there was a feeling of permanence, of eternity about it;
it brought a foretaste of hopeless years of this cold leaden misery, a
NA
this sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily.
â€œWith this idiotic, purely physical weakness, depending on the sunset or
something, one canâ€™t help doing something stupid! Youâ€™ll go to Dounia,
NA
He heard his name called. He looked round. Lebeziatnikov rushed up to
him.
â€œOnly fancy, Iâ€™ve been to your room looking for you. Only fancy, sheâ€™s
carried out her plan, and taken away the children. Sofya Semyonovna and
I have had a job to find them. She is rapping on a frying-pan and making
the children dance. The children are crying. They keep stopping at the
cross-roads and in front of shops; thereâ€™s a crowd of fools running
NA
NA
â€œSimply frantic. That is, itâ€™s not Sofya Semyonovnaâ€™s frantic, but
Katerina Ivanovna, though Sofya Semyonovaâ€™s frantic too. But Katerina
Ivanovna is absolutely frantic. I tell you she is quite mad. Theyâ€™ll be
taken to the police. You can fancy what an effect that will have....
They are on the canal bank, near the bridge now, not far from Sofya
NA
On the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses away from the one
where Sonia lodged, there was a crowd of people, consisting principally
of gutter children. The hoarse broken voice of Katerina Ivanovna could
be heard from the bridge, and it certainly was a strange spectacle
likely to attract a street crowd. Katerina Ivanovna in her old dress
with the green shawl, wearing a torn straw hat, crushed in a hideous way
on one side, was really frantic. She was exhausted and breathless. Her
wasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever, and indeed out
of doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home.
But her excitement did not flag, and every moment her irritation grew
more intense. She rushed at the children, shouted at them, coaxed
them, told them before the crowd how to dance and what to sing, began
explaining to them why it was necessary, and driven to desperation by
their not understanding, beat them.... Then she would make a rush at the
crowd; if she noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look, she
immediately appealed to him to see what these children â€œfrom a genteel,
NA
laughter or jeering in the crowd, she would rush at once at the scoffers
and begin squabbling with them. Some people laughed, others shook their
heads, but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman with the
frightened children. The frying-pan of which Lebeziatnikov had spoken
was not there, at least Raskolnikov did not see it. But instead of
rapping on the pan, Katerina Ivanovna began clapping her wasted hands,
when she made Lida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing. She too joined in
the singing, but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough,
which made her curse in despair and even shed tears. What made her most
furious was the weeping and terror of Kolya and Lida. Some effort had
been made to dress the children up as street singers are dressed. The
boy had on a turban made of something red and white to look like a Turk.
There had been no costume for Lida; she simply had a red knitted cap,
or rather a night cap that had belonged to Marmeladov, decorated with
a broken piece of white ostrich feather, which had been Katerina
Ivanovnaâ€™s grandmotherâ€™s and had been preserved as a family possession.
Polenka was in her everyday dress; she looked in timid perplexity at her
mother, and kept at her side, hiding her tears. She dimly realised her
motherâ€™s condition, and looked uneasily about her. She was terribly
frightened of the street and the crowd. Sonia followed Katerina
Ivanovna, weeping and beseeching her to return home, but Katerina
Ivanovna was not to be persuaded.
NA
coughing. â€œYou donâ€™t know what you ask; you are like a child! Iâ€™ve
told you before that I am not coming back to that drunken German. Let

believed it.) â€œLet that wretch of a general see it! And you are silly,

Raskolnikov and rushing up to him. â€œExplain to this silly girl, please,
that nothing better could be done! Even organ-grinders earn their
living, and everyone will see at once that we are different, that we are
an honourable and bereaved family reduced to beggary. And that general
will lose his post, youâ€™ll see! We shall perform under his windows every
day, and if the Tsar drives by, Iâ€™ll fall on my knees, put the children
before me, show them to him, and say â€˜Defend us father.â€™ He is the
father of the fatherless, he is merciful, heâ€™ll protect us, youâ€™ll
see, and that wretch of a general.... Lida, _tenez vous droite_! Kolya,
youâ€™ll dance again. Why are you whimpering? Whimpering again! What
are you afraid of, stupid? Goodness, what am I to do with them, Rodion
Romanovitch? If you only knew how stupid they are! Whatâ€™s one to do with
NA
And she, almost crying herself--which did not stop her uninterrupted,
rapid flow of talk--pointed to the crying children. Raskolnikov tried
to persuade her to go home, and even said, hoping to work on her vanity,
that it was unseemly for her to be wandering about the streets like
an organ-grinder, as she was intending to become the principal of a
boarding-school.
NA
Ivanovna, her laugh ending in a cough. â€œNo, Rodion Romanovitch, that
dream is over! All have forsaken us!... And that general.... You know,
Rodion Romanovitch, I threw an inkpot at him--it happened to be standing
in the waiting-room by the paper where you sign your name. I wrote my
name, threw it at him and ran away. Oh, the scoundrels, the scoundrels!

is so stupid; I have such a bother with him. What do you want, Polenka?
Tell me in French, _parlez-moi franÃ§ais_. Why, Iâ€™ve taught you, you know
some phrases. Else how are you to show that you are of good family, well
brought-up children, and not at all like other organ-grinders? We arenâ€™t
going to have a Punch and Judy show in the street, but to sing a genteel
song.... Ah, yes,... What are we to sing? You keep putting me out,
but we... you see, we are standing here, Rodion Romanovitch, to find
something to sing and get money, something Kolya can dance to.... For,
as you can fancy, our performance is all impromptu.... We must talk it
over and rehearse it all thoroughly, and then we shall go to Nevsky,
where there are far more people of good society, and we shall be noticed
at once. Lida knows â€˜My Villageâ€™ only, nothing but â€˜My Village,â€™ and
everyone sings that. We must sing something far more genteel.... Well,
have you thought of anything, Polenka? If only youâ€™d help your mother!
My memoryâ€™s quite gone, or I should have thought of something. We really
canâ€™t sing â€˜An Hussar.â€™ Ah, let us sing in French, â€˜Cinq sous,â€™ I have
taught it you, I have taught it you. And as it is in French, people will
see at once that you are children of good family, and that will be much
more touching.... You might sing â€˜Marlborough sâ€™en va-t-en guerre,â€™
for thatâ€™s quite a childâ€™s song and is sung as a lullaby in all the
aristocratic houses.
NA
 she began singing. â€œBut no, better sing â€˜Cinq sous.â€™ Now, Kolya, your
hands on your hips, make haste, and you, Lida, keep turning the other
way, and Polenka and I will sing and clap our hands!
NA
(Cough-cough-cough!) â€œSet your dress straight, Polenka, itâ€™s slipped

particularly necessary to behave nicely and genteelly, that all may
see that you are well-born children. I said at the time that the bodice
should be cut longer, and made of two widths. It was your fault, Sonia,
with your advice to make it shorter, and now you see the child is quite
deformed by it.... Why, youâ€™re all crying again! Whatâ€™s the matter,
stupids? Come, Kolya, begin. Make haste, make haste! Oh, what an
unbearable child!
â€œCinq sous, cinq sous.
NA
A policeman was indeed forcing his way through the crowd. But at that
moment a gentleman in civilian uniform and an overcoat--a solid-looking
official of about fifty with a decoration on his neck (which delighted
Katerina Ivanovna and had its effect on the policeman)--approached and
without a word handed her a green three-rouble note. His face wore
a look of genuine sympathy. Katerina Ivanovna took it and gave him a
polite, even ceremonious, bow.
NA
induced us (take the money, Polenka: you see there are generous and
honourable people who are ready to help a poor gentlewoman in distress).
You see, honoured sir, these orphans of good family--I might even say of
aristocratic connections--and that wretch of a general sat eating
grouse... and stamped at my disturbing him. â€˜Your excellency,â€™ I said,
â€˜protect the orphans, for you knew my late husband, Semyon Zaharovitch,
and on the very day of his death the basest of scoundrels slandered his

NA
Kolya and Lida, scared out of their wits by the crowd, and their
motherâ€™s mad pranks, suddenly seized each other by the hand, and ran off
at the sight of the policeman who wanted to take them away somewhere.
Weeping and wailing, poor Katerina Ivanovna ran after them. She was
a piteous and unseemly spectacle, as she ran, weeping and panting for
breath. Sonia and Polenka rushed after them.
â€œBring them back, bring them back, Sonia! Oh stupid, ungrateful

She stumbled as she ran and fell down.

When they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully, they saw that she had
not cut herself against a stone, as Sonia thought, but that the blood
that stained the pavement red was from her chest.
NA
Lebeziatnikov; â€œthatâ€™s consumption; the blood flows and chokes the
patient. I saw the same thing with a relative of my own not long ago...
nearly a pint of blood, all in a minute.... Whatâ€™s to be done though?
NA
NA
NA
NA
Thanks to the officialâ€™s efforts, this plan was adopted, the policeman
even helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna. She was carried to Soniaâ€™s
room, almost unconscious, and laid on the bed. The blood was still
flowing, but she seemed to be coming to herself. Raskolnikov,
Lebeziatnikov, and the official accompanied Sonia into the room and were
followed by the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which followed
to the very door. Polenka came in holding Kolya and Lida, who
were trembling and weeping. Several persons came in too from the
Kapernaumovsâ€™ room; the landlord, a lame one-eyed man of strange
appearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush, his
wife, a woman with an everlastingly scared expression, and several
open-mouthed children with wonder-struck faces. Among these,
SvidrigaÃ¯lov suddenly made his appearance. Raskolnikov looked at him
with surprise, not understanding where he had come from and not having
noticed him in the crowd. A doctor and priest wore spoken of. The
official whispered to Raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now
for the doctor, but he ordered him to be sent for. Kapernaumov ran
himself.
Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her breath. The bleeding ceased
for a time. She looked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes at
Sonia, who stood pale and trembling, wiping the sweat from her brow with
a handkerchief. At last she asked to be raised. They sat her up on the
bed, supporting her on both sides.
NA
NA
Once more her parched lips were covered with blood. She moved her eyes,
looking about her.

She looked at her with a face of suffering.
â€œWe have been your ruin, Sonia. Polenka, Lida, Kolya, come here! Well,
here they are, Sonia, take them all! I hand them over to you, Iâ€™ve had

She sank more and more into uneasy delirium. At times she shuddered,

but at once sank into delirium again. Her breathing was hoarse and
difficult, there was a sort of rattle in her throat.

â€œ_Du hast die schonsten Augen Madchen, was willst du mehr?_
â€œWhat an idea! _Was willst du mehr?_ What things the fool invents! Ah,

â€œIn the heat of midday in the vale of Dagestan.
â€œAh, how I loved it! I loved that song to distraction, Polenka! Your

She was violently excited and tried to sit up. At last, in a horribly
hoarse, broken voice, she began, shrieking and gasping at every word,

recognised Sonia.
NA
NA
They lifted her up again.
NA
 she cried with vindictive despair, and her head fell heavily back on the
pillow.
She sank into unconsciousness again, but this time it did not last long.
Her pale, yellow, wasted face dropped back, her mouth fell open, her leg
moved convulsively, she gave a deep, deep sigh and died.
Sonia fell upon her, flung her arms about her, and remained motionless
with her head pressed to the dead womanâ€™s wasted bosom. Polenka threw
herself at her motherâ€™s feet, kissing them and weeping violently. Though
Kolya and Lida did not understand what had happened, they had a feeling
that it was something terrible; they put their hands on each otherâ€™s
little shoulders, stared straight at one another and both at once opened
their mouths and began screaming. They were both still in their fancy
dress; one in a turban, the other in the cap with the ostrich feather.

Katerina Ivanovna? It lay there by the pillow; Raskolnikov saw it.
He walked away to the window. Lebeziatnikov skipped up to him.

coming up to them.
Lebeziatnikov at once made room for him and delicately withdrew.
SvidrigaÃ¯lov drew Raskolnikov further away.
â€œI will undertake all the arrangements, the funeral and that. You know

PART VI
CHAPTER I
A strange period began for Raskolnikov: it was as though a fog had
fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there
was no escape. Recalling that period long after, he believed that his
mind had been clouded at times, and that it had continued so, with
intervals, till the final catastrophe. He was convinced that he had been
mistaken about many things at that time, for instance as to the date
of certain events. Anyway, when he tried later on to piece his
recollections together, he learnt a great deal about himself from what
other people told him. He had mixed up incidents and had explained
events as due to circumstances which existed only in his imagination. At
times he was a prey to agonies of morbid uneasiness, amounting sometimes
to panic. But he remembered, too, moments, hours, perhaps whole days,
of complete apathy, which came upon him as a reaction from his previous
terror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility, sometimes
seen in the dying. He seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape
from a full and clear understanding of his position. Certain essential
facts which required immediate consideration were particularly irksome
to him. How glad he would have been to be free from some cares, the
neglect of which would have threatened him with complete, inevitable
ruin.
He was particularly worried about SvidrigaÃ¯lov, he might be said to be
permanently thinking of SvidrigaÃ¯lov. From the time of SvidrigaÃ¯lovâ€™s
too menacing and unmistakable words in Soniaâ€™s room at the moment of
Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s death, the normal working of his mind seemed to
break down. But although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness,
Raskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation of it. At times, finding
himself in a solitary and remote part of the town, in some wretched
eating-house, sitting alone lost in thought, hardly knowing how he had
come there, he suddenly thought of SvidrigaÃ¯lov. He recognised
suddenly, clearly, and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an
understanding with that man and to make what terms he could. Walking
outside the city gates one day, he positively fancied that they had
fixed a meeting there, that he was waiting for SvidrigaÃ¯lov. Another
time he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes
and could not at first understand how he had come there.
But during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s death, he
had two or three times met SvidrigaÃ¯lov at Soniaâ€™s lodging, where he
had gone aimlessly for a moment. They exchanged a few words and made no
reference to the vital subject, as though they were tacitly agreed not
to speak of it for a time.
Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s body was still lying in the coffin, SvidrigaÃ¯lov was
busy making arrangements for the funeral. Sonia too was very busy. At
their last meeting SvidrigaÃ¯lov informed Raskolnikov that he had made
an arrangement, and a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s
children; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded in getting
hold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at
once placed in very suitable institutions; that the money he had settled
on them had been of great assistance, as it is much easier to place
orphans with some property than destitute ones. He said something
too about Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to see
Raskolnikov, mentioning that â€œhe would like to consult with him, that
NA
This conversation took place in the passage on the stairs. SvidrigaÃ¯lov
looked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly, after a brief pause,
dropping his voice, asked: â€œBut how is it, Rodion Romanovitch; you
donâ€™t seem yourself? You look and you listen, but you donâ€™t seem to
understand. Cheer up! Weâ€™ll talk things over; I am only sorry, Iâ€™ve
so much to do of my own business and other peopleâ€™s. Ah, Rodion
NA
NA
He moved to one side to make way for the priest and server, who
were coming up the stairs. They had come for the requiem service. By
SvidrigaÃ¯lovâ€™s orders it was sung twice a day punctually. SvidrigaÃ¯lov
went his way. Raskolnikov stood still a moment, thought, and followed
the priest into Soniaâ€™s room. He stood at the door. They began quietly,
slowly and mournfully singing the service. From his childhood the
thought of death and the presence of death had something oppressive
and mysteriously awful; and it was long since he had heard the requiem
service. And there was something else here as well, too awful and
disturbing. He looked at the children: they were all kneeling by the
coffin; Polenka was weeping. Behind them Sonia prayed, softly and, as it
were, timidly weeping.
â€œThese last two days she hasnâ€™t said a word to me, she hasnâ€™t glanced at

NA
 Raskolnikov stayed all through the service. As he blessed them and
took his leave, the priest looked round strangely. After the service,
Raskolnikov went up to Sonia. She took both his hands and let her
head sink on his shoulder. This slight friendly gesture bewildered
Raskolnikov. It seemed strange to him that there was no trace of
repugnance, no trace of disgust, no tremor in her hand. It was the
furthest limit of self-abnegation, at least so he interpreted it.
Sonia said nothing. Raskolnikov pressed her hand and went out. He felt
very miserable. If it had been possible to escape to some solitude, he
would have thought himself lucky, even if he had to spend his whole life
there. But although he had almost always been by himself of late, he had
never been able to feel alone. Sometimes he walked out of the town on to
the high road, once he had even reached a little wood, but the lonelier
the place was, the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near
him. It did not frighten him, but greatly annoyed him, so that he
made haste to return to the town, to mingle with the crowd, to enter
restaurants and taverns, to walk in busy thoroughfares. There he felt
easier and even more solitary. One day at dusk he sat for an hour
listening to songs in a tavern and he remembered that he positively
enjoyed it. But at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again,
as though his conscience smote him. â€œHere I sit listening to singing,

that that was not the only cause of his uneasiness; there was something
requiring immediate decision, but it was something he could not clearly
understand or put into words. It was a hopeless tangle. â€œNo, better the

the tavern and rushed away almost at a run. The thought of Dounia and
his mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic. That night he woke
up before morning among some bushes in Krestovsky Island, trembling
all over with fever; he walked home, and it was early morning when he
arrived. After some hoursâ€™ sleep the fever left him, but he woke up
late, two oâ€™clock in the afternoon.
He remembered that Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s funeral had been fixed for that
day, and was glad that he was not present at it. Nastasya brought him
some food; he ate and drank with appetite, almost with greediness. His
head was fresher and he was calmer than he had been for the last three
days. He even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks of panic.
The door opened and Razumihin came in.

He was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it. He spoke with evident
annoyance, but without hurry or raising his voice. He looked as though
he had some special fixed determination.

to hell, but from what I see, itâ€™s clear to me that I canâ€™t make head or
tail of it; please donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve come to ask you questions. I donâ€™t
want to know, hang it! If you begin telling me your secrets, I dare say
I shouldnâ€™t stay to listen, I should go away cursing. I have only come
to find out once for all whether itâ€™s a fact that you are mad? There is
a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so. I admit
Iâ€™ve been disposed to that opinion myself, judging from your stupid,
repulsive and quite inexplicable actions, and from your recent behavior
to your mother and sister. Only a monster or a madman could treat them
NA
NA
â€œJust now. Havenâ€™t you seen them since then? What have you been doing
with yourself? Tell me, please. Iâ€™ve been to you three times already.
Your mother has been seriously ill since yesterday. She had made up
her mind to come to you; Avdotya Romanovna tried to prevent her; she
wouldnâ€™t hear a word. â€˜If he is ill, if his mind is giving way, who can
look after him like his mother?â€™ she said. We all came here together, we
couldnâ€™t let her come alone all the way. We kept begging her to be calm.
We came in, you werenâ€™t here; she sat down, and stayed ten minutes,
while we stood waiting in silence. She got up and said: â€˜If heâ€™s
gone out, that is, if he is well, and has forgotten his mother, itâ€™s
humiliating and unseemly for his mother to stand at his door begging for
kindness.â€™ She returned home and took to her bed; now she is in a fever.
â€˜I see,â€™ she said, â€˜that he has time for _his girl_.â€™ She means by _your
girl_ Sofya Semyonovna, your betrothed or your mistress, I donâ€™t know. I
went at once to Sofya Semyonovnaâ€™s, for I wanted to know what was going
on. I looked round, I saw the coffin, the children crying, and
Sofya Semyonovna trying them on mourning dresses. No sign of you. I
apologised, came away, and reported to Avdotya Romanovna. So thatâ€™s all
nonsense and you havenâ€™t got a girl; the most likely thing is that you
are mad. But here you sit, guzzling boiled beef as though youâ€™d not had
a bite for three days. Though as far as that goes, madmen eat too, but
though you have not said a word to me yet... you are not mad! That Iâ€™d
swear! Above all, you are not mad! So you may go to hell, all of you,
for thereâ€™s some mystery, some secret about it, and I donâ€™t intend to

Razumihin paused for a minute.

â€œWell, itâ€™s pretty plain. Wherever I might go, whatever happened to me,
you would remain to look after them. I, so to speak, give them into your
keeping, Razumihin. I say this because I know quite well how you love
her, and am convinced of the purity of your heart. I know that she too
may love you and perhaps does love you already. Now decide for yourself,
NA
â€œRodya! You see... well.... Ach, damn it! But where do you mean to go?
Of course, if itâ€™s all a secret, never mind.... But I... I shall find

and that youâ€™ve made it all up. Anyway you are a capital fellow, a

Razumihin stood lost in thought and excitement, making a silent
conclusion.

desperate step, thatâ€™s certain. It can only be that! And... and Dounia

â€œShe got a letter to-day. It upset her very much--very much indeed. Too
much so. I began speaking of you, she begged me not to. Then... then
she said that perhaps we should very soon have to part... then she began
warmly thanking me for something; then she went to her room and locked

They were both silent.
â€œGood-bye, Rodion. There was a time, brother, when I.... Never mind,
good-bye. You see, there was a time.... Well, good-bye! I must be off
NA
He hurried out; but when he had almost closed the door behind him, he
suddenly opened it again, and said, looking away:
â€œOh, by the way, do you remember that murder, you know Porfiryâ€™s, that
old woman? Do you know the murderer has been found, he has confessed
and given the proofs. Itâ€™s one of those very workmen, the painter, only
fancy! Do you remember I defended them here? Would you believe it, all
that scene of fighting and laughing with his companions on the stairs
while the porter and the two witnesses were going up, he got up on
purpose to disarm suspicion. The cunning, the presence of mind of the
young dog! One can hardly credit it; but itâ€™s his own explanation, he
has confessed it all. And what a fool I was about it! Well, heâ€™s simply
a genius of hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspicions of
the lawyers--so thereâ€™s nothing much to wonder at, I suppose! Of course
people like that are always possible. And the fact that he couldnâ€™t keep
up the character, but confessed, makes him easier to believe in. But
NA
â€œTell me, please, from whom did you hear that, and why does it interest

â€œWhat next? You ask me why it interests me!... Well, I heard it from

Iâ€™m busy. There was a time when I fancied... But no matter, another
time!... What need is there for me to drink now? You have made me drunk
without wine. I am drunk, Rodya! Good-bye, Iâ€™m going. Iâ€™ll come again

He went out.
NA
decided, as he slowly descended the stairs. â€œAnd heâ€™s drawn his sister
in; thatâ€™s quite, quite in keeping with Avdotya Romanovnaâ€™s character.
There are interviews between them!... She hinted at it too... So many of
her words.... and hints... bear that meaning! And how else can all this
tangle be explained? Hm! And I was almost thinking... Good heavens,
what I thought! Yes, I took leave of my senses and I wronged him! It was
his doing, under the lamp in the corridor that day. Pfoo! What a crude,
nasty, vile idea on my part! Nikolay is a brick, for confessing.... And
how clear it all is now! His illness then, all his strange actions...
before this, in the university, how morose he used to be, how gloomy....
But whatâ€™s the meaning now of that letter? Thereâ€™s something in that,
NA
He thought of Dounia, realising all he had heard and his heart throbbed,
and he suddenly broke into a run.
As soon as Razumihin went out, Raskolnikov got up, turned to the window,
walked into one corner and then into another, as though forgetting the
smallness of his room, and sat down again on the sofa. He felt, so to
speak, renewed; again the struggle, so a means of escape had come.
â€œYes, a means of escape had come! It had been too stifling, too
cramping, the burden had been too agonising. A lethargy had come upon
him at times. From the moment of the scene with Nikolay at Porfiryâ€™s he
had been suffocating, penned in without hope of escape. After Nikolayâ€™s
confession, on that very day had come the scene with Sonia; his
behaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike anything he
could have imagined beforehand; he had grown feebler, instantly and
fundamentally! And he had agreed at the time with Sonia, he had agreed
in his heart he could not go on living alone with such a thing on his
mind!
â€œAnd SvidrigaÃ¯lov was a riddle... He worried him, that was true, but
somehow not on the same point. He might still have a struggle to come
with SvidrigaÃ¯lov. SvidrigaÃ¯lov, too, might be a means of escape; but
Porfiry was a different matter.
â€œAnd so Porfiry himself had explained it to Razumihin, had explained it
_psychologically_. He had begun bringing in his damned psychology again!
Porfiry? But to think that Porfiry should for one moment believe that
Nikolay was guilty, after what had passed between them before Nikolayâ€™s
appearance, after that tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte interview, which could have only
_one_ explanation? (During those days Raskolnikov had often recalled
passages in that scene with Porfiry; he could not bear to let his mind
rest on it.) Such words, such gestures had passed between them, they
had exchanged such glances, things had been said in such a tone and had
reached such a pass, that Nikolay, whom Porfiry had seen through at the
first word, at the first gesture, could not have shaken his conviction.
â€œAnd to think that even Razumihin had begun to suspect! The scene in the
corridor under the lamp had produced its effect then. He had rushed to
Porfiry.... But what had induced the latter to receive him like that?
What had been his object in putting Razumihin off with Nikolay? He must
have some plan; there was some design, but what was it? It was true that
a long time had passed since that morning--too long a time--and no sight
NA
Raskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room, still pondering. It
was the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in his mind,
NA
possible; he, too, seems to be waiting for me to come to him of my own
NA
weary heart that he might have killed either of those two--Porfiry or
SvidrigaÃ¯lov. At least he felt that he would be capable of doing it
later, if not now.
NA
But no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled upon Porfiry
himself in the passage. He was coming in to see him. Raskolnikov was
dumbfounded for a minute, but only for one minute. Strange to say, he
was not very much astonished at seeing Porfiry and scarcely afraid of
him. He was simply startled, but was quickly, instantly, on his guard.
â€œPerhaps this will mean the end? But how could Porfiry have approached
so quietly, like a cat, so that he had heard nothing? Could he have been

NA
laughing. â€œIâ€™ve been meaning to look in a long time; I was passing by
and thought why not go in for five minutes. Are you going out? I wonâ€™t

NA
a seat with so pleased and friendly an expression that he would have
marvelled at himself, if he could have seen it.
The last moment had come, the last drops had to be drained! So a man
will sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand,
yet when the knife is at his throat at last, he feels no fear.
Raskolnikov seated himself directly facing Porfiry, and looked at him
without flinching. Porfiry screwed up his eyes and began lighting a
cigarette.

lighted one. â€œThey are pernicious, positively pernicious, and yet I
canâ€™t give them up! I cough, I begin to have tickling in my throat and
a difficulty in breathing. You know I am a coward, I went lately to
Dr. B----n; he always gives at least half an hour to each patient. He
positively laughed looking at me; he sounded me: â€˜Tobaccoâ€™s bad for
you,â€™ he said, â€˜your lungs are affected.â€™ But how am I to give it up?
What is there to take its place? I donâ€™t drink, thatâ€™s the mischief,

came back to him, and he felt a rush of the feeling that had come upon
him then.
â€œI came to see you the day before yesterday, in the evening; you didnâ€™t

Iâ€™d return your call. I walked in as your door was wide open, I looked
round, waited and went out without leaving my name with your servant.

Raskolnikovâ€™s face grew more and more gloomy. Porfiry seemed to guess
his state of mind.
â€œIâ€™ve come to have it out with you, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow!
NA
slight smile, just patting Raskolnikovâ€™s knee.
But almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into his
face; to his surprise Raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in it. He had
never seen and never suspected such an expression in his face.
â€œA strange scene passed between us last time we met, Rodion Romanovitch.
Our first interview, too, was a strange one; but then... and one thing
after another! This is the point: I have perhaps acted unfairly to you;
I feel it. Do you remember how we parted? Your nerves were unhinged and
your knees were shaking and so were mine. And, you know, our behaviour
was unseemly, even ungentlemanly. And yet we are gentlemen, above all,
in any case, gentlemen; that must be understood. Do you remember what we

NA
on, turning his head away and dropping his eyes, as though unwilling to
disconcert his former victim and as though disdaining his former wiles.
â€œYes, such suspicions and such scenes cannot continue for long. Nikolay
put a stop to it, or I donâ€™t know what we might not have come to. That
damned workman was sitting at the time in the next room--can you realise
that? You know that, of course; and I am aware that he came to you
afterwards. But what you supposed then was not true: I had not sent for
anyone, I had made no kind of arrangements. You ask why I hadnâ€™t? What
shall I say to you? it had all come upon me so suddenly. I had scarcely
sent for the porters (you noticed them as you went out, I dare say).
An idea flashed upon me; I was firmly convinced at the time, you see,
Rodion Romanovitch. Come, I thought--even if I let one thing slip for
a time, I shall get hold of something else--I shanâ€™t lose what I want,
anyway. You are nervously irritable, Rodion Romanovitch, by temperament;
itâ€™s out of proportion with other qualities of your heart and character,
which I flatter myself I have to some extent divined. Of course I did
reflect even then that it does not always happen that a man gets up and
blurts out his whole story. It does happen sometimes, if you make a
man lose all patience, though even then itâ€™s rare. I was capable of
realising that. If I only had a fact, I thought, the least little fact
to go upon, something I could lay hold of, something tangible, not
merely psychological. For if a man is guilty, you must be able to get
something substantial out of him; one may reckon upon most surprising
results indeed. I was reckoning on your temperament, Rodion Romanovitch,
on your temperament above all things! I had great hopes of you at that
NA
NA
the question without thinking.
NA
NA
â€œWhat am I driving at? Iâ€™ve come to explain myself, I consider it my
duty, so to speak. I want to make clear to you how the whole business,
the whole misunderstanding arose. Iâ€™ve caused you a great deal of
suffering, Rodion Romanovitch. I am not a monster. I understand what
it must mean for a man who has been unfortunate, but who is proud,
imperious and above all, impatient, to have to bear such treatment!
I regard you in any case as a man of noble character and not without
elements of magnanimity, though I donâ€™t agree with all your convictions.
I wanted to tell you this first, frankly and quite sincerely, for above
all I donâ€™t want to deceive you. When I made your acquaintance, I felt
attracted by you. Perhaps you will laugh at my saying so. You have a
right to. I know you disliked me from the first and indeed youâ€™ve no
reason to like me. You may think what you like, but I desire now to do
all I can to efface that impression and to show that I am a man of heart
NA
Porfiry Petrovitch made a dignified pause. Raskolnikov felt a rush of
renewed alarm. The thought that Porfiry believed him to be innocent
began to make him uneasy.
NA
Petrovitch went on. â€œIndeed, I could scarcely attempt it. To begin with
there were rumours. Through whom, how, and when those rumours came to
me... and how they affected you, I need not go into. My suspicions
were aroused by a complete accident, which might just as easily not have
happened. What was it? Hm! I believe there is no need to go into that
either. Those rumours and that accident led to one idea in my mind. I
admit it openly--for one may as well make a clean breast of it--I was
the first to pitch on you. The old womanâ€™s notes on the pledges and
the rest of it--that all came to nothing. Yours was one of a hundred.
I happened, too, to hear of the scene at the office, from a man who
described it capitally, unconsciously reproducing the scene with great
vividness. It was just one thing after another, Rodion Romanovitch, my
dear fellow! How could I avoid being brought to certain ideas? From a
hundred rabbits you canâ€™t make a horse, a hundred suspicions donâ€™t make
a proof, as the English proverb says, but thatâ€™s only from the rational
point of view--you canâ€™t help being partial, for after all a lawyer
is only human. I thought, too, of your article in that journal, do you
remember, on your first visit we talked of it? I jeered at you at the
time, but that was only to lead you on. I repeat, Rodion Romanovitch,
you are ill and impatient. That you were bold, headstrong, in earnest
and... had felt a great deal I recognised long before. I, too, have felt
the same, so that your article seemed familiar to me. It was conceived
on sleepless nights, with a throbbing heart, in ecstasy and suppressed
enthusiasm. And that proud suppressed enthusiasm in young people is
dangerous! I jeered at you then, but let me tell you that, as a literary
amateur, I am awfully fond of such first essays, full of the heat of
youth. There is a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist. Your
article is absurd and fantastic, but thereâ€™s a transparent sincerity,
a youthful incorruptible pride and the daring of despair in it. Itâ€™s a
gloomy article, but thatâ€™s whatâ€™s fine in it. I read your article and
put it aside, thinking as I did so â€˜that man wonâ€™t go the common way.â€™
Well, I ask you, after that as a preliminary, how could I help being
carried away by what followed? Oh, dear, I am not saying anything, I
am not making any statement now. I simply noted it at the time. What is
there in it? I reflected. Thereâ€™s nothing in it, that is really nothing
and perhaps absolutely nothing. And itâ€™s not at all the thing for
the prosecutor to let himself be carried away by notions: here I have
Nikolay on my hands with actual evidence against him--you may think what
you like of it, but itâ€™s evidence. He brings in his psychology, too; one
has to consider him, too, for itâ€™s a matter of life and death. Why am
I explaining this to you? That you may understand, and not blame my
malicious behaviour on that occasion. It was not malicious, I assure
you, he-he! Do you suppose I didnâ€™t come to search your room at the
time? I did, I did, he-he! I was here when you were lying ill in bed,
not officially, not in my own person, but I was here. Your room was
searched to the last thread at the first suspicion; but _umsonst_! I
thought to myself, now that man will come, will come of himself and
quickly, too; if heâ€™s guilty, heâ€™s sure to come. Another man wouldnâ€™t,
but he will. And you remember how Mr. Razumihin began discussing the
subject with you? We arranged that to excite you, so we purposely spread
rumours, that he might discuss the case with you, and Razumihin is not a
man to restrain his indignation. Mr. Zametov was tremendously struck by
your anger and your open daring. Think of blurting out in a restaurant
â€˜I killed her.â€™ It was too daring, too reckless. I thought so myself, if
he is guilty he will be a formidable opponent. That was what I thought
at the time. I was expecting you. But you simply bowled Zametov over
and... well, you see, it all lies in this--that this damnable psychology
can be taken two ways! Well, I kept expecting you, and so it was, you
came! My heart was fairly throbbing. Ach!
â€œNow, why need you have come? Your laughter, too, as you came in, do you
remember? I saw it all plain as daylight, but if I hadnâ€™t expected you
so specially, I should not have noticed anything in your laughter. You
see what influence a mood has! Mr. Razumihin then--ah, that stone, that
stone under which the things were hidden! I seem to see it somewhere
in a kitchen garden. It was in a kitchen garden, you told Zametov and
afterwards you repeated that in my office? And when we began picking
your article to pieces, how you explained it! One could take every word
of yours in two senses, as though there were another meaning hidden.
â€œSo in this way, Rodion Romanovitch, I reached the furthest limit, and
knocking my head against a post, I pulled myself up, asking myself what
I was about. After all, I said, you can take it all in another sense if
you like, and itâ€™s more natural so, indeed. I couldnâ€™t help admitting
it was more natural. I was bothered! â€˜No, Iâ€™d better get hold of some
little factâ€™ I said. So when I heard of the bell-ringing, I held my
breath and was all in a tremor. â€˜Here is my little fact,â€™ thought I, and
I didnâ€™t think it over, I simply wouldnâ€™t. I would have given a thousand
roubles at that minute to have seen you with my own eyes, when you
walked a hundred paces beside that workman, after he had called you
murderer to your face, and you did not dare to ask him a question
all the way. And then what about your trembling, what about your
bell-ringing in your illness, in semi-delirium?
â€œAnd so, Rodion Romanovitch, can you wonder that I played such pranks on
you? And what made you come at that very minute? Someone seemed to
have sent you, by Jove! And if Nikolay had not parted us... and do you
remember Nikolay at the time? Do you remember him clearly? It was a
thunderbolt, a regular thunderbolt! And how I met him! I didnâ€™t believe
in the thunderbolt, not for a minute. You could see it for yourself;
and how could I? Even afterwards, when you had gone and he began making
very, very plausible answers on certain points, so that I was surprised
at him myself, even then I didnâ€™t believe his story! You see what it is
to be as firm as a rock! No, thought I, _MorgenfrÃ¼h_. What has Nikolay

â€œRazumihin told me just now that you think Nikolay guilty and had

His voice failed him, and he broke off. He had been listening in
indescribable agitation, as this man who had seen through and through
him, went back upon himself. He was afraid of believing it and did not
believe it. In those still ambiguous words he kept eagerly looking for
something more definite and conclusive.
NA
from Raskolnikov, who had till then been silent. â€œHe-he-he! But I had to
put Mr. Razumihin off; two is company, three is none. Mr. Razumihin is
not the right man, besides he is an outsider. He came running to me
with a pale face.... But never mind him, why bring him in? To return
to Nikolay, would you like to know what sort of a type he is, how I
understand him, that is? To begin with, he is still a child and not
exactly a coward, but something by way of an artist. Really, donâ€™t laugh
at my describing him so. He is innocent and responsive to influence. He
has a heart, and is a fantastic fellow. He sings and dances, he tells
stories, they say, so that people come from other villages to hear him.
He attends school too, and laughs till he cries if you hold up a finger
to him; he will drink himself senseless--not as a regular vice, but at
times, when people treat him, like a child. And he stole, too, then,
without knowing it himself, for â€˜How can it be stealing, if one picks it
up?â€™ And do you know he is an Old Believer, or rather a dissenter? There
have been Wanderers[*] in his family, and he was for two years in his
village under the spiritual guidance of a certain elder. I learnt all
this from Nikolay and from his fellow villagers. And whatâ€™s more, he
wanted to run into the wilderness! He was full of fervour, prayed at
night, read the old books, â€˜the trueâ€™ ones, and read himself crazy.
     [*] A religious sect.--TRANSLATORâ€™S NOTE.
â€œPetersburg had a great effect upon him, especially the women and the
wine. He responds to everything and he forgot the elder and all that. I
learnt that an artist here took a fancy to him, and used to go and see
him, and now this business came upon him.
â€œWell, he was frightened, he tried to hang himself! He ran away! How can
one get over the idea the people have of Russian legal proceedings? The
very word â€˜trialâ€™ frightens some of them. Whose fault is it? We shall
see what the new juries will do. God grant they do good! Well, in
prison, it seems, he remembered the venerable elder; the Bible, too,
made its appearance again. Do you know, Rodion Romanovitch, the force of
the word â€˜sufferingâ€™ among some of these people! Itâ€™s not a question of
suffering for someoneâ€™s benefit, but simply, â€˜one must suffer.â€™ If they
suffer at the hands of the authorities, so much the better. In my time
there was a very meek and mild prisoner who spent a whole year in prison
always reading his Bible on the stove at night and he read himself
crazy, and so crazy, do you know, that one day, apropos of nothing, he
seized a brick and flung it at the governor; though he had done him
no harm. And the way he threw it too: aimed it a yard on one side
on purpose, for fear of hurting him. Well, we know what happens to
a prisoner who assaults an officer with a weapon. So â€˜he took his
suffering.â€™
â€œSo I suspect now that Nikolay wants to take his suffering or something
of the sort. I know it for certain from facts, indeed. Only he doesnâ€™t
know that I know. What, you donâ€™t admit that there are such fantastic
people among the peasants? Lots of them. The elder now has begun
influencing him, especially since he tried to hang himself. But heâ€™ll
come and tell me all himself. You think heâ€™ll hold out? Wait a bit,
heâ€™ll take his words back. I am waiting from hour to hour for him to
come and abjure his evidence. I have come to like that Nikolay and am
studying him in detail. And what do you think? He-he! He answered me
very plausibly on some points, he obviously had collected some evidence
and prepared himself cleverly. But on other points he is simply at sea,
knows nothing and doesnâ€™t even suspect that he doesnâ€™t know!
â€œNo, Rodion Romanovitch, Nikolay doesnâ€™t come in! This is a fantastic,
gloomy business, a modern case, an incident of to-day when the heart
of man is troubled, when the phrase is quoted that blood â€˜renews,â€™ when
comfort is preached as the aim of life. Here we have bookish dreams, a
heart unhinged by theories. Here we see resolution in the first stage,
but resolution of a special kind: he resolved to do it like jumping over
a precipice or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to the
crime. He forgot to shut the door after him, and murdered two people for
a theory. He committed the murder and couldnâ€™t take the money, and what
he did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone. It wasnâ€™t enough for
him to suffer agony behind the door while they battered at the door and
rung the bell, no, he had to go to the empty lodging, half delirious, to
recall the bell-ringing, he wanted to feel the cold shiver over again....
Well, that we grant, was through illness, but consider this: he is
a murderer, but looks upon himself as an honest man, despises others,
poses as injured innocence. No, thatâ€™s not the work of a Nikolay, my

All that had been said before had sounded so like a recantation that

Porfiry Petrovitch sank back in his chair, as though he were amazed at
the question.

almost in a whisper, in a voice of genuine conviction.
Raskolnikov leapt from the sofa, stood up for a few seconds and sat down

whispered sternly, with conviction.
They were both silent and the silence lasted strangely long, about ten
minutes. Raskolnikov put his elbow on the table and passed his fingers
through his hair. Porfiry Petrovitch sat quietly waiting. Suddenly
Raskolnikov looked scornfully at Porfiry.
â€œYou are at your old tricks again, Porfiry Petrovitch! Your old method
NA
â€œOh, stop that, what does that matter now? It would be a different
matter if there were witnesses present, but we are whispering alone. You
see yourself that I have not come to chase and capture you like a hare.

â€œOh, thatâ€™s your question! I will answer you, point for point. In the

NA
â€œAch, what if I am convinced? Thatâ€™s only my dream for the time. Why
should I put you in safety? You know thatâ€™s it, since you ask me to do
it. If I confront you with that workman for instance and you say to him
â€˜were you drunk or not? Who saw me with you? I simply took you to be
drunk, and you were drunk, too.â€™ Well, what could I answer, especially
as your story is a more likely one than his? for thereâ€™s nothing but
psychology to support his evidence--thatâ€™s almost unseemly with his ugly
mug, while you hit the mark exactly, for the rascal is an inveterate
drunkard and notoriously so. And I have myself admitted candidly several
times already that that psychology can be taken in two ways and that the
second way is stronger and looks far more probable, and that apart from
that I have as yet nothing against you. And though I shall put you in
prison and indeed have come--quite contrary to etiquette--to inform you
of it beforehand, yet I tell you frankly, also contrary to etiquette,
that it wonâ€™t be to my advantage. Well, secondly, Iâ€™ve come to you
NA
NA
â€œBecause, as I told you just now, I consider I owe you an explanation. I
donâ€™t want you to look upon me as a monster, as I have a genuine liking
for you, you may believe me or not. And in the third place Iâ€™ve come to
you with a direct and open proposition--that you should surrender
and confess. It will be infinitely more to your advantage and to my
advantage too, for my task will be done. Well, is this open on my part
NA
Raskolnikov thought a minute.
â€œListen, Porfiry Petrovitch. You said just now you have nothing but
psychology to go on, yet now youâ€™ve gone on mathematics. Well, what if
NA
â€œNo, Rodion Romanovitch, I am not mistaken. I have a little fact even
NA
NA
â€œI wonâ€™t tell you what, Rodion Romanovitch. And in any case, I havenâ€™t
the right to put it off any longer, I must arrest you. So think it over:
it makes no difference to me _now_ and so I speak only for your sake.
NA
Raskolnikov smiled malignantly.
â€œThatâ€™s not simply ridiculous, itâ€™s positively shameless. Why, even if I
were guilty, which I donâ€™t admit, what reason should I have to confess,
NA
â€œAh, Rodion Romanovitch, donâ€™t put too much faith in words, perhaps
prison will not be altogether a restful place. Thatâ€™s only theory and
my theory, and what authority am I for you? Perhaps, too, even now I am
hiding something from you? I canâ€™t lay bare everything, he-he! And how
can you ask what advantage? Donâ€™t you know how it would lessen your
sentence? You would be confessing at a moment when another man has taken
the crime on himself and so has muddled the whole case. Consider that! I
swear before God that I will so arrange that your confession shall
come as a complete surprise. We will make a clean sweep of all these
psychological points, of a suspicion against you, so that your crime
will appear to have been something like an aberration, for in truth it
was an aberration. I am an honest man, Rodion Romanovitch, and will keep

Raskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his head sink
dejectedly. He pondered a long while and at last smiled again, but his
smile was sad and gentle.

â€œWhy, is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of? It may be that you
are afraid of it without knowing it, because you are young! But anyway

NA
though he did not want to speak aloud.
He got up again as though he meant to go away, but sat down again in
evident despair.
â€œHang it, if you like! Youâ€™ve lost faith and you think that I am
grossly flattering you; but how long has your life been? How much do
you understand? You made up a theory and then were ashamed that it broke
down and turned out to be not at all original! It turned out something
base, thatâ€™s true, but you are not hopelessly base. By no means so base!
At least you didnâ€™t deceive yourself for long, you went straight to the
furthest point at one bound. How do I regard you? I regard you as one
of those men who would stand and smile at their torturer while he cuts
their entrails out, if only they have found faith or God. Find it and
you will live. You have long needed a change of air. Suffering, too,
is a good thing. Suffer! Maybe Nikolay is right in wanting to suffer.
I know you donâ€™t believe in it--but donâ€™t be over-wise; fling yourself
straight into life, without deliberation; donâ€™t be afraid--the flood
will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again. What
bank? How can I tell? I only believe that you have long life before
you. I know that you take all my words now for a set speech prepared
beforehand, but maybe you will remember them after. They may be of use
some time. Thatâ€™s why I speak. Itâ€™s as well that you only killed the
old woman. If youâ€™d invented another theory you might perhaps have
done something a thousand times more hideous. You ought to thank God,
perhaps. How do you know? Perhaps God is saving you for something.
But keep a good heart and have less fear! Are you afraid of the great
expiation before you? No, it would be shameful to be afraid of it. Since
you have taken such a step, you must harden your heart. There is justice
in it. You must fulfil the demands of justice. I know that you donâ€™t
believe it, but indeed, life will bring you through. You will live it

Raskolnikov positively started.
â€œBut who are you? what prophet are you? From the height of what majestic

â€œWho am I? I am a man with nothing to hope for, thatâ€™s all. A man
perhaps of feeling and sympathy, maybe of some knowledge too, but my day
is over. But you are a different matter, there is life waiting for you.
Though, who knows? maybe your life, too, will pass off in smoke and come
to nothing. Come, what does it matter, that you will pass into another
class of men? Itâ€™s not comfort you regret, with your heart! What of
it that perhaps no one will see you for so long? Itâ€™s not time, but
yourself that will decide that. Be the sun and all will see you. The
sun has before all to be the sun. Why are you smiling again? At my being
such a Schiller? I bet youâ€™re imagining that I am trying to get round
you by flattery. Well, perhaps I am, he-he-he! Perhaps youâ€™d better not
believe my word, perhaps youâ€™d better never believe it altogether--Iâ€™m
made that way, I confess it. But let me add, you can judge for yourself,
NA
NA
â€œWell, I can let you walk about another day or two. Think it over, my
NA
NA
â€œNo, you wonâ€™t run away. A peasant would run away, a fashionable
dissenter would run away, the flunkey of another manâ€™s thought, for
youâ€™ve only to show him the end of your little finger and heâ€™ll be ready
to believe in anything for the rest of his life. But youâ€™ve ceased to
believe in your theory already, what will you run away with? And what
would you do in hiding? It would be hateful and difficult for you, and
what you need more than anything in life is a definite position, an
atmosphere to suit you. And what sort of atmosphere would you have? If
you ran away, youâ€™d come back to yourself. _You canâ€™t get on without
us._ And if I put you in prison--say youâ€™ve been there a month, or two,
or three--remember my word, youâ€™ll confess of yourself and perhaps to
your own surprise. You wonâ€™t know an hour beforehand that you are coming
with a confession. I am convinced that you will decide, â€˜to take your
suffering.â€™ You donâ€™t believe my words now, but youâ€™ll come to it of
yourself. For suffering, Rodion Romanovitch, is a great thing. Never
mind my having grown fat, I know all the same. Donâ€™t laugh at it,
thereâ€™s an idea in suffering, Nokolay is right. No, you wonâ€™t run away,

Raskolnikov got up and took his cap. Porfiry Petrovitch also rose.

in it and think you quite incapable of it), yet in case you were taken
during these forty or fifty hours with the notion of putting an end to
the business in some other way, in some fantastic fashion--laying hands
on yourself--(itâ€™s an absurd proposition, but you must forgive me for
it) do leave a brief but precise note, only two lines, and mention the

Porfiry went out, stooping and avoiding looking at Raskolnikov. The
latter went to the window and waited with irritable impatience till he
calculated that Porfiry had reached the street and moved away. Then he
too went hurriedly out of the room.
CHAPTER III
He hurried to SvidrigaÃ¯lovâ€™s. What he had to hope from that man he
did not know. But that man had some hidden power over him. Having once
recognised this, he could not rest, and now the time had come.
On the way, one question particularly worried him: had SvidrigaÃ¯lov been
to Porfiryâ€™s?
As far as he could judge, he would swear to it, that he had not. He
pondered again and again, went over Porfiryâ€™s visit; no, he hadnâ€™t been,
of course he hadnâ€™t.
But if he had not been yet, would he go? Meanwhile, for the present he
fancied he couldnâ€™t. Why? He could not have explained, but if he could,
he would not have wasted much thought over it at the moment. It all
worried him and at the same time he could not attend to it. Strange to
say, none would have believed it perhaps, but he only felt a faint vague
anxiety about his immediate future. Another, much more important anxiety
tormented him--it concerned himself, but in a different, more vital way.
Moreover, he was conscious of immense moral fatigue, though his mind was
working better that morning than it had done of late.
And was it worth while, after all that had happened, to contend with
these new trivial difficulties? Was it worth while, for instance, to
manoeuvre that SvidrigaÃ¯lov should not go to Porfiryâ€™s? Was it worth
while to investigate, to ascertain the facts, to waste time over anyone
like SvidrigaÃ¯lov?
Oh, how sick he was of it all!
And yet he was hastening to SvidrigaÃ¯lov; could he be expecting
something _new_ from him, information, or means of escape? Men will
catch at straws! Was it destiny or some instinct bringing them together?
Perhaps it was only fatigue, despair; perhaps it was not SvidrigaÃ¯lov
but some other whom he needed, and SvidrigaÃ¯lov had simply presented
himself by chance. Sonia? But what should he go to Sonia for now? To beg
her tears again? He was afraid of Sonia, too. Sonia stood before him as
an irrevocable sentence. He must go his own way or hers. At that moment
especially he did not feel equal to seeing her. No, would it not be
better to try SvidrigaÃ¯lov? And he could not help inwardly owning that
he had long felt that he must see him for some reason.
But what could they have in common? Their very evil-doing could not
be of the same kind. The man, moreover, was very unpleasant, evidently
depraved, undoubtedly cunning and deceitful, possibly malignant. Such
stories were told about him. It is true he was befriending Katerina
Ivanovnaâ€™s children, but who could tell with what motive and what it
meant? The man always had some design, some project.
There was another thought which had been continually hovering of late
about Raskolnikovâ€™s mind, and causing him great uneasiness. It was so
painful that he made distinct efforts to get rid of it. He sometimes
thought that SvidrigaÃ¯lov was dogging his footsteps. SvidrigaÃ¯lov had
found out his secret and had had designs on Dounia. What if he had them
still? Wasnâ€™t it practically certain that he had? And what if, having
learnt his secret and so having gained power over him, he were to use it
as a weapon against Dounia?
This idea sometimes even tormented his dreams, but it had never
presented itself so vividly to him as on his way to SvidrigaÃ¯lov.
The very thought moved him to gloomy rage. To begin with, this would
transform everything, even his own position; he would have at once to
confess his secret to Dounia. Would he have to give himself up perhaps
to prevent Dounia from taking some rash step? The letter? This morning
Dounia had received a letter. From whom could she get letters in
Petersburg? Luzhin, perhaps? Itâ€™s true Razumihin was there to protect
her, but Razumihin knew nothing of the position. Perhaps it was his duty
to tell Razumihin? He thought of it with repugnance.
In any case he must see SvidrigaÃ¯lov as soon as possible, he decided
finally. Thank God, the details of the interview were of little
consequence, if only he could get at the root of the matter; but
if SvidrigaÃ¯lov were capable... if he were intriguing against
Dounia--then...
Raskolnikov was so exhausted by what he had passed through that month
that he could only decide such questions in one way; â€œthen I shall kill
NA
A sudden anguish oppressed his heart, he stood still in the middle of
the street and began looking about to see where he was and which way he
was going. He found himself in X. Prospect, thirty or forty paces from
the Hay Market, through which he had come. The whole second storey of
the house on the left was used as a tavern. All the windows were wide
open; judging from the figures moving at the windows, the rooms were
full to overflowing. There were sounds of singing, of clarionet and
violin, and the boom of a Turkish drum. He could hear women shrieking.
He was about to turn back wondering why he had come to the X. Prospect,
when suddenly at one of the end windows he saw SvidrigaÃ¯lov, sitting
at a tea-table right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth.
Raskolnikov was dreadfully taken aback, almost terrified. SvidrigaÃ¯lov
was silently watching and scrutinising him and, what struck Raskolnikov
at once, seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved.
Raskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him, but to be looking
absent-mindedly away, while he watched him out of the corner of his eye.
His heart was beating violently. Yet, it was evident that SvidrigaÃ¯lov
did not want to be seen. He took the pipe out of his mouth and was on
the point of concealing himself, but as he got up and moved back his
chair, he seemed to have become suddenly aware that Raskolnikov had seen
him, and was watching him. What had passed between them was much the
same as what happened at their first meeting in Raskolnikovâ€™s room. A
sly smile came into SvidrigaÃ¯lovâ€™s face and grew broader and
broader. Each knew that he was seen and watched by the other. At last
SvidrigaÃ¯lov broke into a loud laugh.

window.
Raskolnikov went up into the tavern. He found SvidrigaÃ¯lov in a tiny
back room, adjoining the saloon in which merchants, clerks and numbers
of people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to the
desperate bawling of a chorus of singers. The click of billiard balls
could be heard in the distance. On the table before SvidrigaÃ¯lov stood
an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne. In the room he found
also a boy with a little hand organ, a healthy-looking red-cheeked girl
of eighteen, wearing a tucked-up striped skirt, and a Tyrolese hat with
ribbons. In spite of the chorus in the other room, she was singing some
servantsâ€™ hall song in a rather husky contralto, to the accompaniment of
the organ.

She had sung her guttural rhymes, too, with a serious and respectful
expression in her face.
NA
NA
â€œAs you like, I didnâ€™t mean it for you. Drink, Katia! I donâ€™t want
NA
laid down a yellow note.
Katia drank off her glass of wine, as women do, without putting it down,
in twenty gulps, took the note and kissed SvidrigaÃ¯lovâ€™s hand, which he
allowed quite seriously. She went out of the room and the boy trailed
after her with the organ. Both had been brought in from the street.
SvidrigaÃ¯lov had not been a week in Petersburg, but everything about him
was already, so to speak, on a patriarchal footing; the waiter, Philip,
was by now an old friend and very obsequious.
The door leading to the saloon had a lock on it. SvidrigaÃ¯lov was at
home in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it. The tavern was
dirty and wretched, not even second-rate.
NA
I donâ€™t know what made me turn from the Hay Market into the X. Prospect
just now. I never take this turning. I turn to the right from the Hay
Market. And this isnâ€™t the way to you. I simply turned and here you are.

admit it, even if you do inwardly believe it a miracle! Here you say
that it may be only chance. And what cowards they all are here, about

â€œOh, well, it was a different matter. Everyone has his own plans. And
apropos of the miracle let me tell you that I think you have been asleep
for the last two or three days. I told you of this tavern myself, there
is no miracle in your coming straight here. I explained the way myself,
told you where it was, and the hours you could find me here. Do you

NA
â€œI believe you. I told you twice. The address has been stamped
mechanically on your memory. You turned this way mechanically and yet
precisely according to the direction, though you are not aware of
it. When I told you then, I hardly hoped you understood me. You give
yourself away too much, Rodion Romanovitch. And another thing, Iâ€™m
convinced there are lots of people in Petersburg who talk to themselves
as they walk. This is a town of crazy people. If only we had scientific
men, doctors, lawyers and philosophers might make most valuable
investigations in Petersburg each in his own line. There are few places
where there are so many gloomy, strong and queer influences on the soul
of man as in Petersburg. The mere influences of climate mean so much.
And itâ€™s the administrative centre of all Russia and its character must
be reflected on the whole country. But that is neither here nor there
now. The point is that I have several times watched you. You walk out
of your house--holding your head high--twenty paces from home you let it
sink, and fold your hands behind your back. You look and evidently see
nothing before nor beside you. At last you begin moving your lips and
talking to yourself, and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim, and at
last stand still in the middle of the road. Thatâ€™s not at all the thing.
Someone may be watching you besides me, and it wonâ€™t do you any good.
Itâ€™s nothing really to do with me and I canâ€™t cure you, but, of course,

Raskolnikov dropped his right elbow on the table, leaned his chin in the
fingers of his right hand, and stared intently at SvidrigaÃ¯lov. For a
full minute he scrutinised his face, which had impressed him before. It
was a strange face, like a mask; white and red, with bright red lips,
with a flaxen beard, and still thick flaxen hair. His eyes were somehow
too blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed. There was
something awfully unpleasant in that handsome face, which looked so
wonderfully young for his age. SvidrigaÃ¯lov was smartly dressed in light
summer clothes and was particularly dainty in his linen. He wore a huge

suddenly, coming with nervous impatience straight to the point. â€œEven
though perhaps you are the most dangerous man if you care to injure me,
I donâ€™t want to put myself out any more. I will show you at once that I
donâ€™t prize myself as you probably think I do. Iâ€™ve come to tell you at
once that if you keep to your former intentions with regard to my sister
and if you think to derive any benefit in that direction from what has
been discovered of late, I will kill you before you get me locked up.
You can reckon on my word. You know that I can keep it. And in the
second place if you want to tell me anything--for I keep fancying all
this time that you have something to tell me--make haste and tell it,
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou urged me yourself to frankness just now, and at the first question
NA
keep fancying that I have aims of my own and so you look at me with
suspicion. Of course itâ€™s perfectly natural in your position. But
though I should like to be friends with you, I shanâ€™t trouble myself
to convince you of the contrary. The game isnâ€™t worth the candle and I

NA
â€œWhy, simply as an interesting subject for observation. I liked the
fantastic nature of your position--thatâ€™s what it was! Besides you are
the brother of a person who greatly interested me, and from that person
I had in the past heard a very great deal about you, from which I
gathered that you had a great influence over her; isnâ€™t that enough?
Ha-ha-ha! Still I must admit that your question is rather complex, and
is difficult for me to answer. Here, you, for instance, have come to me
not only for a definite object, but for the sake of hearing something

train was reckoning on you, on your telling me something new, and on my

NA
â€œHow can I tell you? How do I know? You see in what a tavern I spend all
my time and itâ€™s my enjoyment, thatâ€™s to say itâ€™s no great enjoyment,
but one must sit somewhere; that poor Katia now--you saw her?... If only

He pointed to a little table in the corner where the remnants of a
terrible-looking beef-steak and potatoes lay on a tin dish.
â€œHave you dined, by the way? Iâ€™ve had something and want nothing more.
I donâ€™t drink, for instance, at all. Except for champagne I never touch
anything, and not more than a glass of that all the evening, and even
that is enough to make my head ache. I ordered it just now to wind
myself up, for I am just going off somewhere and you see me in a
peculiar state of mind. That was why I hid myself just now like a

first about women in general; you know I am fond of talking. Tell me,
what should I restrain myself for? Why should I give up women, since I
NA
NA
â€œOh, very well, for vice then. You insist on its being vice. But anyway
I like a direct question. In this vice at least there is something
permanent, founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy,
something present in the blood like an ever-burning ember, for ever
setting one on fire and, maybe, not to be quickly extinguished, even
NA
NA
â€œOh, thatâ€™s what you think, is it! I agree, that it is a disease like
everything that exceeds moderation. And, of course, in this one must
exceed moderation. But in the first place, everybody does so in one way
or another, and in the second place, of course, one ought to be moderate
and prudent, however mean it may be, but what am I to do? If I hadnâ€™t
this, I might have to shoot myself. I am ready to admit that a decent

idealist! Of course thatâ€™s all as it should be and it would be
surprising if it were not so, yet it is strange in reality.... Ah,
what a pity I have no time, for youâ€™re a most interesting type! And,

wonâ€™t dispute it, let me be a braggart, why not brag, if it hurts no
one? I spent seven years in the country with Marfa Petrovna, so now when
I come across an intelligent person like you--intelligent and highly
interesting--I am simply glad to talk and, besides, Iâ€™ve drunk that
half-glass of champagne and itâ€™s gone to my head a little. And besides,
thereâ€™s a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously, but about that

as it were, ill at ease at having come here. He felt convinced that

myself, I mean. Iâ€™ll tell you something. If you like Iâ€™ll tell you how a
woman tried â€˜to saveâ€™ me, as you would call it? It will be an answer to
your first question indeed, for the woman was your sister. May I tell

â€œOh, donâ€™t be uneasy. Besides, even in a worthless low fellow like me,

CHAPTER IV
NA
I was in the debtorsâ€™ prison here, for an immense sum, and had not
any expectation of being able to pay it. Thereâ€™s no need to go into
particulars how Marfa Petrovna bought me out; do you know to what a
point of insanity a woman can sometimes love? She was an honest woman,
and very sensible, although completely uneducated. Would you believe
that this honest and jealous woman, after many scenes of hysterics and
reproaches, condescended to enter into a kind of contract with me which
she kept throughout our married life? She was considerably older than
I, and besides, she always kept a clove or something in her mouth. There
was so much swinishness in my soul and honesty too, of a sort, as to
tell her straight out that I couldnâ€™t be absolutely faithful to her.
This confession drove her to frenzy, but yet she seems in a way to have
liked my brutal frankness. She thought it showed I was unwilling to
deceive her if I warned her like this beforehand and for a jealous
woman, you know, thatâ€™s the first consideration. After many tears an
unwritten contract was drawn up between us: first, that I would never
leave Marfa Petrovna and would always be her husband; secondly, that I
would never absent myself without her permission; thirdly, that I would
never set up a permanent mistress; fourthly, in return for this, Marfa
Petrovna gave me a free hand with the maidservants, but only with her
secret knowledge; fifthly, God forbid my falling in love with a woman of
our class; sixthly, in case I--which God forbid--should be visited by
a great serious passion I was bound to reveal it to Marfa Petrovna. On
this last score, however, Marfa Petrovna was fairly at ease. She was a
sensible woman and so she could not help looking upon me as a dissolute
profligate incapable of real love. But a sensible woman and a jealous
woman are two very different things, and thatâ€™s where the trouble
came in. But to judge some people impartially we must renounce certain
preconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to the ordinary people
about us. I have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than
in anyoneâ€™s. Perhaps you have already heard a great deal that was
ridiculous and absurd about Marfa Petrovna. She certainly had some very
ridiculous ways, but I tell you frankly that I feel really sorry for the
innumerable woes of which I was the cause. Well, and thatâ€™s enough, I
think, by way of a decorous _oraison funÃ¨bre_ for the most tender wife
of a most tender husband. When we quarrelled, I usually held my tongue
and did not irritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to
attain its object, it influenced her, it pleased her, indeed. These were
times when she was positively proud of me. But your sister she couldnâ€™t
put up with, anyway. And however she came to risk taking such a
beautiful creature into her house as a governess. My explanation is that
Marfa Petrovna was an ardent and impressionable woman and simply fell
in love herself--literally fell in love--with your sister. Well, little
wonder--look at Avdotya Romanovna! I saw the danger at the first glance
and what do you think, I resolved not to look at her even. But Avdotya
Romanovna herself made the first step, would you believe it? Would you
believe it too that Marfa Petrovna was positively angry with me at first
for my persistent silence about your sister, for my careless reception
of her continual adoring praises of Avdotya Romanovna. I donâ€™t know
what it was she wanted! Well, of course, Marfa Petrovna told Avdotya
Romanovna every detail about me. She had the unfortunate habit of
telling literally everyone all our family secrets and continually
complaining of me; how could she fail to confide in such a delightful
new friend? I expect they talked of nothing else but me and no doubt
Avdotya Romanovna heard all those dark mysterious rumours that were
current about me.... I donâ€™t mind betting that you too have heard
NA
â€œI have. Luzhin charged you with having caused the death of a child. Is
NA
NA
disgust and annoyance. â€œIf you insist on wanting to know about all that
NA
â€œI was told too about some footman of yours in the country whom you
NA
NA
obvious impatience.
â€œWas that the footman who came to you after death to fill your pipe?...
NA
irritated.
SvidrigaÃ¯lov looked at him attentively and Raskolnikov fancied he caught
a flash of spiteful mockery in that look. But SvidrigaÃ¯lov restrained
himself and answered very civilly:
â€œYes, it was. I see that you, too, are extremely interested and shall
feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity. Upon
my soul! I see that I really might pass for a romantic figure with
some people. Judge how grateful I must be to Marfa Petrovna for having
repeated to Avdotya Romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip
about me. I dare not guess what impression it made on her, but in any
case it worked in my interests. With all Avdotya Romanovnaâ€™s natural
aversion and in spite of my invariably gloomy and repellent aspect--she
did at least feel pity for me, pity for a lost soul. And if once a
girlâ€™s heart is moved to _pity_, itâ€™s more dangerous than anything. She
is bound to want to â€˜save him,â€™ to bring him to his senses, and lift
him up and draw him to nobler aims, and restore him to new life and
usefulness--well, we all know how far such dreams can go. I saw at once
that the bird was flying into the cage of herself. And I too made ready.
I think you are frowning, Rodion Romanovitch? Thereâ€™s no need. As you
know, it all ended in smoke. (Hang it all, what a lot I am drinking!)
Do you know, I always, from the very beginning, regretted that it wasnâ€™t
your sisterâ€™s fate to be born in the second or third century A.D., as
the daughter of a reigning prince or some governor or pro-consul in Asia
Minor. She would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endure
martyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hot
pincers. And she would have gone to it of herself. And in the fourth or
fifth century she would have walked away into the Egyptian desert and
would have stayed there thirty years living on roots and ecstasies and
visions. She is simply thirsting to face some torture for someone, and
if she canâ€™t get her torture, sheâ€™ll throw herself out of a window. Iâ€™ve
heard something of a Mr. Razumihin--heâ€™s said to be a sensible fellow;
his surname suggests it, indeed. Heâ€™s probably a divinity student. Well,
heâ€™d better look after your sister! I believe I understand her, and I am
proud of it. But at the beginning of an acquaintance, as you know, one
is apt to be more heedless and stupid. One doesnâ€™t see clearly. Hang it
all, why is she so handsome? Itâ€™s not my fault. In fact, it began on
my side with a most irresistible physical desire. Avdotya Romanovna is
awfully chaste, incredibly and phenomenally so. Take note, I tell you
this about your sister as a fact. She is almost morbidly chaste, in
spite of her broad intelligence, and it will stand in her way. There
happened to be a girl in the house then, Parasha, a black-eyed
wench, whom I had never seen before--she had just come from another
village--very pretty, but incredibly stupid: she burst into tears,
wailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal.
One day after dinner Avdotya Romanovna followed me into an avenue in
the garden and with flashing eyes _insisted_ on my leaving poor Parasha
alone. It was almost our first conversation by ourselves. I, of course,
was only too pleased to obey her wishes, tried to appear disconcerted,
embarrassed, in fact played my part not badly. Then came interviews,
mysterious conversations, exhortations, entreaties, supplications, even
tears--would you believe it, even tears? Think what the passion for
propaganda will bring some girls to! I, of course, threw it all on
my destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and finally
resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the
female heart, a weapon which never fails one. Itâ€™s the well-known
resource--flattery. Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the
truth and nothing easier than flattery. If thereâ€™s the hundredth part
of a false note in speaking the truth, it leads to a discord, and that
leads to trouble. But if all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it
is just as agreeable, and is heard not without satisfaction. It may be
a coarse satisfaction, but still a satisfaction. And however coarse the
flattery, at least half will be sure to seem true. Thatâ€™s so for all
stages of development and classes of society. A vestal virgin might be
seduced by flattery. I can never remember without laughter how I once
seduced a lady who was devoted to her husband, her children, and her
principles. What fun it was and how little trouble! And the lady really
had principles--of her own, anyway. All my tactics lay in simply being
utterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity. I flattered her
shamelessly, and as soon as I succeeded in getting a pressure of
the hand, even a glance from her, I would reproach myself for having
snatched it by force, and would declare that she had resisted, so that
I could never have gained anything but for my being so unprincipled.
I maintained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee my
treachery, and yielded to me unconsciously, unawares, and so on. In
fact, I triumphed, while my lady remained firmly convinced that she was
innocent, chaste, and faithful to all her duties and obligations and
had succumbed quite by accident. And how angry she was with me when I
explained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she was
just as eager as I. Poor Marfa Petrovna was awfully weak on the side of
flattery, and if I had only cared to, I might have had all her property
settled on me during her lifetime. (I am drinking an awful lot of wine
now and talking too much.) I hope you wonâ€™t be angry if I mention now
that I was beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya Romanovna.
But I was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all. Avdotya Romanovna had
several times--and one time in particular--been greatly displeased by
the expression of my eyes, would you believe it? There was sometimes a
light in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger and
more unguarded till it was hateful to her. No need to go into detail,
but we parted. There I acted stupidly again. I fell to jeering in the
coarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me; Parasha
came on to the scene again, and not she alone; in fact there was a
tremendous to-do. Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, if you could only see how your
sisterâ€™s eyes can flash sometimes! Never mind my being drunk at this
moment and having had a whole glass of wine. I am speaking the truth.
I assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams; the very rustle of
her dress was more than I could stand at last. I really began to think
that I might become epileptic. I could never have believed that I could
be moved to such a frenzy. It was essential, indeed, to be reconciled,
but by then it was impossible. And imagine what I did then! To what
a pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy! Never undertake
anything in a frenzy, Rodion Romanovitch. I reflected that Avdotya
Romanovna was after all a beggar (ach, excuse me, thatâ€™s not the word...
but does it matter if it expresses the meaning?), that she lived by
her work, that she had her mother and you to keep (ach, hang it, you
are frowning again), and I resolved to offer her all my money--thirty
thousand roubles I could have realised then--if she would run away with
me here, to Petersburg. Of course I should have vowed eternal love,
rapture, and so on. Do you know, I was so wild about her at that time
that if she had told me to poison Marfa Petrovna or to cut her throat
and to marry herself, it would have been done at once! But it ended in
the catastrophe of which you know already. You can fancy how frantic I
was when I heard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly
attorney, Luzhin, and had almost made a match between them--which would
really have been just the same thing as I was proposing. Wouldnâ€™t it?
Wouldnâ€™t it? I notice that youâ€™ve begun to be very attentive... you

SvidrigaÃ¯lov struck the table with his fist impatiently. He was flushed.
Raskolnikov saw clearly that the glass or glass and a half of champagne
that he had sipped almost unconsciously was affecting him--and he
resolved to take advantage of the opportunity. He felt very suspicious
of SvidrigaÃ¯lov.
â€œWell, after what you have said, I am fully convinced that you have

smiled mockingly. â€œYou are right, she doesnâ€™t love me, but you can
never be sure of what has passed between husband and wife or lover and
mistress. Thereâ€™s always a little corner which remains a secret to
the world and is only known to those two. Will you answer for it that

designs.

NA
NA
â€œDid I? Iâ€™ve forgotten. But I couldnâ€™t have told you so for certain for
I had not even seen my betrothed; I only meant to. But now I really
have a betrothed and itâ€™s a settled thing, and if it werenâ€™t that I have
business that canâ€™t be put off, I would have taken you to see them
at once, for I should like to ask your advice. Ach, hang it, only ten
minutes left! See, look at the watch. But I must tell you, for itâ€™s an
interesting story, my marriage, in its own way. Where are you off to?
NA
NA
â€œNot at all? We shall see. Iâ€™ll take you there, Iâ€™ll show you my
betrothed, only not now. For youâ€™ll soon have to be off. You have to go
to the right and I to the left. Do you know that Madame Resslich, the
woman I am lodging with now, eh? I know what youâ€™re thinking, that sheâ€™s
the woman whose girl they say drowned herself in the winter. Come, are
you listening? She arranged it all for me. Youâ€™re bored, she said,
you want something to fill up your time. For, you know, I am a gloomy,
depressed person. Do you think Iâ€™m light-hearted? No, Iâ€™m gloomy. I do
no harm, but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three days at a
time. And that Resslich is a sly hussy, I tell you. I know what she has
got in her mind; she thinks I shall get sick of it, abandon my wife and
depart, and sheâ€™ll get hold of her and make a profit out of her--in our
class, of course, or higher. She told me the father was a broken-down
retired official, who has been sitting in a chair for the last three
years with his legs paralysed. The mamma, she said, was a sensible
woman. There is a son serving in the provinces, but he doesnâ€™t help;
there is a daughter, who is married, but she doesnâ€™t visit them. And
theyâ€™ve two little nephews on their hands, as though their own children
were not enough, and theyâ€™ve taken from school their youngest daughter,
a girl whoâ€™ll be sixteen in another month, so that then she can be
married. She was for me. We went there. How funny it was! I present
myself--a landowner, a widower, of a well-known name, with connections,
with a fortune. What if I am fifty and she is not sixteen? Who thinks
of that? But itâ€™s fascinating, isnâ€™t it? It is fascinating, ha-ha! You
should have seen how I talked to the papa and mamma. It was worth paying
to have seen me at that moment. She comes in, curtseys, you can fancy,
still in a short frock--an unopened bud! Flushing like a sunset--she had
been told, no doubt. I donâ€™t know how you feel about female faces, but
to my mind these sixteen years, these childish eyes, shyness and tears
of bashfulness are better than beauty; and she is a perfect little
picture, too. Fair hair in little curls, like a lambâ€™s, full little rosy
lips, tiny feet, a charmer!... Well, we made friends. I told them I was
in a hurry owing to domestic circumstances, and the next day, that is
the day before yesterday, we were betrothed. When I go now I take her on
my knee at once and keep her there.... Well, she flushes like a sunset
and I kiss her every minute. Her mamma of course impresses on her that
this is her husband and that this must be so. Itâ€™s simply delicious! The
present betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage. Here you
have what is called _la nature et la vÃ©ritÃ©_, ha-ha! Iâ€™ve talked to her
twice, she is far from a fool. Sometimes she steals a look at me that
positively scorches me. Her face is like Raphaelâ€™s Madonna. You know,
the Sistine Madonnaâ€™s face has something fantastic in it, the face
of mournful religious ecstasy. Havenâ€™t you noticed it? Well, sheâ€™s
something in that line. The day after weâ€™d been betrothed, I bought her
presents to the value of fifteen hundred roubles--a set of diamonds and
another of pearls and a silver dressing-case as large as this, with all
sorts of things in it, so that even my Madonnaâ€™s face glowed. I sat her
on my knee, yesterday, and I suppose rather too unceremoniously--she
flushed crimson and the tears started, but she didnâ€™t want to show it.
We were left alone, she suddenly flung herself on my neck (for the first
time of her own accord), put her little arms round me, kissed me, and
vowed that she would be an obedient, faithful, and good wife, would make
me happy, would devote all her life, every minute of her life, would
sacrifice everything, everything, and that all she asks in return is
my _respect_, and that she wants â€˜nothing, nothing more from me, no
presents.â€™ Youâ€™ll admit that to hear such a confession, alone, from an
angel of sixteen in a muslin frock, with little curls, with a flush
of maiden shyness in her cheeks and tears of enthusiasm in her eyes is
rather fascinating! Isnâ€™t it fascinating? Itâ€™s worth paying for, isnâ€™t

â€œThe fact is this monstrous difference in age and development excites

â€œWhy, of course. Everyone thinks of himself, and he lives most gaily who
knows best how to deceive himself. Ha-ha! But why are you so keen about
NA
â€œBut you have provided for the children of Katerina Ivanovna. Though...
NA
NA
â€œI can tell you one curious instance of it. The first day I came here I
visited various haunts, after seven years I simply rushed at them. You
probably notice that I am not in a hurry to renew acquaintance with my
old friends. I shall do without them as long as I can. Do you know, when
I was with Marfa Petrovna in the country, I was haunted by the thought
of these places where anyone who knows his way about can find a great
deal. Yes, upon my soul! The peasants have vodka, the educated young
people, shut out from activity, waste themselves in impossible dreams
and visions and are crippled by theories; Jews have sprung up and are
amassing money, and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery. From
the first hour the town reeked of its familiar odours. I chanced to be
in a frightful den--I like my dens dirty--it was a dance, so called, and
there was a _cancan_ such as I never saw in my day. Yes, there you
have progress. All of a sudden I saw a little girl of thirteen, nicely
dressed, dancing with a specialist in that line, with another one
_vis-Ã -vis_. Her mother was sitting on a chair by the wall. You canâ€™t
fancy what a _cancan_ that was! The girl was ashamed, blushed, at
last felt insulted, and began to cry. Her partner seized her and began
whirling her round and performing before her; everyone laughed and--I
like your public, even the _cancan_ public--they laughed and shouted,
â€˜Serves her right--serves her right! Shouldnâ€™t bring children!â€™ Well,
itâ€™s not my business whether that consoling reflection was logical or
not. I at once fixed on my plan, sat down by the mother, and began by
saying that I too was a stranger and that people here were ill-bred and
that they couldnâ€™t distinguish decent folks and treat them with respect,
gave her to understand that I had plenty of money, offered to take them
home in my carriage. I took them home and got to know them. They were
lodging in a miserable little hole and had only just arrived from the
country. She told me that she and her daughter could only regard my
acquaintance as an honour. I found out that they had nothing of their
own and had come to town upon some legal business. I proffered my
services and money. I learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloon
by mistake, believing that it was a genuine dancing class. I offered to
assist in the young girlâ€™s education in French and dancing. My offer was
accepted with enthusiasm as an honour--and we are still friendly.... If
NA
â€œStop! Enough of your vile, nasty anecdotes, depraved vile, sensual

But you know I shall tell you these things on purpose, for the pleasure

angrily.
SvidrigaÃ¯lov laughed heartily; finally he called Philip, paid his bill,
and began getting up.

getting up. â€œNo doubt it is a pleasure for a worn-out profligate to
describe such adventures with a monstrous project of the same sort in
his mind--especially under such circumstances and to such a man as

Raskolnikov with some surprise, â€œif you come to that, you are a thorough
cynic yourself. Youâ€™ve plenty to make you so, anyway. You can understand
a great deal... and you can do a great deal too. But enough. I sincerely
regret not having had more talk with you, but I shanâ€™t lose sight of

SvidrigaÃ¯lov walked out of the restaurant. Raskolnikov walked out after
him. SvidrigaÃ¯lov was not however very drunk, the wine had affected him
for a moment, but it was passing off every minute. He was preoccupied
with something of importance and was frowning. He was apparently excited
and uneasy in anticipation of something. His manner to Raskolnikov had
changed during the last few minutes, and he was ruder and more sneering
every moment. Raskolnikov noticed all this, and he too was uneasy. He
became very suspicious of SvidrigaÃ¯lov and resolved to follow him.
They came out on to the pavement.
â€œYou go to the right, and I to the left, or if you like, the other way.
NA
And he walked to the right towards the Hay Market.
CHAPTER V
Raskolnikov walked after him.
NA
NA
NA
Both stood still and gazed at one another, as though measuring their
strength.
NA
_positive_ that you have not given up your designs on my sister, but
are pursuing them more actively than ever. I have learnt that my sister
received a letter this morning. You have hardly been able to sit still
all this time.... You may have unearthed a wife on the way, but that

Raskolnikov could hardly have said himself what he wanted and of what he
wished to make certain.
NA
NA
Again they stood for a minute facing each other. At last SvidrigaÃ¯lovâ€™s
face changed. Having satisfied himself that Raskolnikov was not
frightened at his threat, he assumed a mirthful and friendly air.
â€œWhat a fellow! I purposely refrained from referring to your affair,
though I am devoured by curiosity. Itâ€™s a fantastic affair. Iâ€™ve put it
off till another time, but youâ€™re enough to rouse the dead.... Well, let
us go, only I warn you beforehand I am only going home for a moment,
to get some money; then I shall lock up the flat, take a cab and go to
NA
â€œIâ€™m coming to your lodgings, not to see you but Sofya Semyonovna, to
NA
â€œThatâ€™s as you like, but Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. She has taken
the three children to an old lady of high rank, the patroness of some
orphan asylums, whom I used to know years ago. I charmed the old lady by
depositing a sum of money with her to provide for the three children of
Katerina Ivanovna and subscribing to the institution as well. I told her
too the story of Sofya Semyonovna in full detail, suppressing nothing.
It produced an indescribable effect on her. Thatâ€™s why Sofya Semyonovna
has been invited to call to-day at the X. Hotel where the lady is
NA
NA
â€œAs you like, itâ€™s nothing to me, but I wonâ€™t come with you; here we are
at home. By the way, I am convinced that you regard me with suspicion
just because I have shown such delicacy and have not so far troubled
you with questions... you understand? It struck you as extraordinary; I
NA
NA
NA
surprised if you had let that pass after all that has happened. Ha-ha!
Though I did understand something of the pranks you had been up to and
were telling Sofya Semyonovna about, what was the meaning of it? Perhaps
I am quite behind the times and canâ€™t understand. For goodnessâ€™ sake,
NA
NA
â€œBut Iâ€™m not talking about that (though I did hear something). No, Iâ€™m
talking of the way you keep sighing and groaning now. The Schiller in
you is in revolt every moment, and now you tell me not to listen at
doors. If thatâ€™s how you feel, go and inform the police that you had
this mischance: you made a little mistake in your theory. But if you are
convinced that one mustnâ€™t listen at doors, but one may murder old women
at oneâ€™s pleasure, youâ€™d better be off to America and make haste. Run,
young man! There may still be time. Iâ€™m speaking sincerely. Havenâ€™t you
NA
NA
â€œI understand (but donâ€™t put yourself out, donâ€™t discuss it if you donâ€™t
want to). I understand the questions you are worrying over--moral ones,
arenâ€™t they? Duties of citizen and man? Lay them all aside. They are
nothing to you now, ha-ha! Youâ€™ll say you are still a man and a citizen.
If so you ought not to have got into this coil. Itâ€™s no use taking up a
job you are not fit for. Well, youâ€™d better shoot yourself, or donâ€™t you
NA
NA
â€œWhat a queer fellow! But here we are. Welcome to the staircase. You
see, thatâ€™s the way to Sofya Semyonovna. Look, there is no one at home.
Donâ€™t you believe me? Ask Kapernaumov. She leaves the key with him. Here
is Madame de Kapernaumov herself. Hey, what? She is rather deaf. Has she
gone out? Where? Did you hear? She is not in and wonâ€™t be till late in
the evening probably. Well, come to my room; you wanted to come and see
me, didnâ€™t you? Here we are. Madame Resslichâ€™s not at home. She is a
woman who is always busy, an excellent woman I assure you.... She might
have been of use to you if you had been a little more sensible. Now,
see! I take this five-per-cent bond out of the bureau--see what a lot
Iâ€™ve got of them still--this one will be turned into cash to-day. I
mustnâ€™t waste any more time. The bureau is locked, the flat is locked,
and here we are again on the stairs. Shall we take a cab? Iâ€™m going to
the Islands. Would you like a lift? Iâ€™ll take this carriage. Ah, you
refuse? You are tired of it! Come for a drive! I believe it will come on
NA
SvidrigaÃ¯lov was already in the carriage. Raskolnikov decided that his
suspicions were at least for that moment unjust. Without answering a
word he turned and walked back towards the Hay Market. If he had only
turned round on his way he might have seen SvidrigaÃ¯lov get out not a
hundred paces off, dismiss the cab and walk along the pavement. But he
had turned the corner and could see nothing. Intense disgust drew him
away from SvidrigaÃ¯lov.
â€œTo think that I could for one instant have looked for help from that
NA
Raskolnikovâ€™s judgment was uttered too lightly and hastily: there was
something about SvidrigaÃ¯lov which gave him a certain original, even a
mysterious character. As concerned his sister, Raskolnikov was convinced
that SvidrigaÃ¯lov would not leave her in peace. But it was too tiresome
and unbearable to go on thinking and thinking about this.
When he was alone, he had not gone twenty paces before he sank, as
usual, into deep thought. On the bridge he stood by the railing and
began gazing at the water. And his sister was standing close by him.
He met her at the entrance to the bridge, but passed by without seeing
her. Dounia had never met him like this in the street before and was
struck with dismay. She stood still and did not know whether to call
to him or not. Suddenly she saw SvidrigaÃ¯lov coming quickly from the
direction of the Hay Market.
He seemed to be approaching cautiously. He did not go on to the
bridge, but stood aside on the pavement, doing all he could to avoid
Raskolnikovâ€™s seeing him. He had observed Dounia for some time and had
been making signs to her. She fancied he was signalling to beg her not
to speak to her brother, but to come to him.
That was what Dounia did. She stole by her brother and went up to
SvidrigaÃ¯lov.
NA
Rodion Romanovitch to know of our meeting. I must tell you Iâ€™ve been
sitting with him in the restaurant close by, where he looked me up and
I had great difficulty in getting rid of him. He has somehow heard of
my letter to you and suspects something. It wasnâ€™t you who told him, of

NA
wonâ€™t see us. I have to tell you that I am going no further with you.
NA
â€œIn the first place, I canâ€™t say it in the street; secondly, you must
hear Sofya Semyonovna too; and, thirdly, I will show you some papers....
Oh well, if you wonâ€™t agree to come with me, I shall refuse to give
any explanation and go away at once. But I beg you not to forget that
a very curious secret of your beloved brotherâ€™s is entirely in my
NA
Dounia stood still, hesitating, and looked at SvidrigaÃ¯lov with
searching eyes.
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo, I have not said a word to her and am not quite certain whether she
is at home now. But most likely she is. She has buried her stepmother
to-day: she is not likely to go visiting on such a day. For the time I
donâ€™t want to speak to anyone about it and I half regret having spoken
to you. The slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like
this. I live there in that house, we are coming to it. Thatâ€™s the porter
of our house--he knows me very well; you see, heâ€™s bowing; he sees Iâ€™m
coming with a lady and no doubt he has noticed your face already and you
will be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious. Excuse
my putting things so coarsely. I havenâ€™t a flat to myself; Sofya
Semyonovnaâ€™s room is next to mine--she lodges in the next flat. The
whole floor is let out in lodgings. Why are you frightened like a child?
NA
SvidrigaÃ¯lovâ€™s lips were twisted in a condescending smile; but he was in
no smiling mood. His heart was throbbing and he could scarcely breathe.
He spoke rather loud to cover his growing excitement. But Dounia did not
notice this peculiar excitement, she was so irritated by his remark that
she was frightened of him like a child and that he was so terrible to
her.
â€œThough I know that you are not a man... of honour, I am not in the
NA
but her face was very pale.
SvidrigaÃ¯lov stopped at Soniaâ€™s room.
â€œAllow me to inquire whether she is at home.... She is not. How
unfortunate! But I know she may come quite soon. If sheâ€™s gone out, it
can only be to see a lady about the orphans. Their mother is dead....
Iâ€™ve been meddling and making arrangements for them. If Sofya Semyonovna
does not come back in ten minutes, I will send her to you, to-day if
you like. This is my flat. These are my two rooms. Madame Resslich,
my landlady, has the next room. Now, look this way. I will show you
my chief piece of evidence: this door from my bedroom leads into two
perfectly empty rooms, which are to let. Here they are... You must look
NA
SvidrigaÃ¯lov occupied two fairly large furnished rooms. Dounia was
looking about her mistrustfully, but saw nothing special in the
furniture or position of the rooms. Yet there was something to observe,
for instance, that SvidrigaÃ¯lovâ€™s flat was exactly between two sets of
almost uninhabited apartments. His rooms were not entered directly
from the passage, but through the landladyâ€™s two almost empty rooms.
Unlocking a door leading out of his bedroom, SvidrigaÃ¯lov showed Dounia
the two empty rooms that were to let. Dounia stopped in the doorway, not
knowing what she was called to look upon, but SvidrigaÃ¯lov hastened to
explain.
â€œLook here, at this second large room. Notice that door, itâ€™s locked.
By the door stands a chair, the only one in the two rooms. I brought it
from my rooms so as to listen more conveniently. Just the other side of
the door is Sofya Semyonovnaâ€™s table; she sat there talking to Rodion
Romanovitch. And I sat here listening on two successive evenings, for
two hours each time--and of course I was able to learn something, what

NA
NA
He brought Avdotya Romanovna back into his sitting-room and offered her
a chair. He sat down at the opposite side of the table, at least seven
feet from her, but probably there was the same glow in his eyes which
had once frightened Dounia so much. She shuddered and once more looked
about her distrustfully. It was an involuntary gesture; she evidently
did not wish to betray her uneasiness. But the secluded position of
SvidrigaÃ¯lovâ€™s lodging had suddenly struck her. She wanted to ask
whether his landlady at least were at home, but pride kept her from
asking. Moreover, she had another trouble in her heart incomparably
greater than fear for herself. She was in great distress.
NA
what you write? You hint at a crime committed, you say, by my brother.
You hint at it too clearly; you darenâ€™t deny it now. I must tell you
that Iâ€™d heard of this stupid story before you wrote and donâ€™t believe a
word of it. Itâ€™s a disgusting and ridiculous suspicion. I know the story
and why and how it was invented. You can have no proofs. You promised to
prove it. Speak! But let me warn you that I donâ€™t believe you! I donâ€™t
NA
Dounia said this, speaking hurriedly, and for an instant the colour
rushed to her face.
â€œIf you didnâ€™t believe it, how could you risk coming alone to my rooms?
NA
NA
â€œThereâ€™s no denying that you are a brave girl. Upon my word, I thought
you would have asked Mr. Razumihin to escort you here. But he was not
with you nor anywhere near. I was on the look-out. Itâ€™s spirited of
you, it proves you wanted to spare Rodion Romanovitch. But everything
is divine in you.... About your brother, what am I to say to you? Youâ€™ve
NA
NA
â€œNo, not on that, but on his own words. He came here on two successive
evenings to see Sofya Semyonovna. Iâ€™ve shown you where they sat. He made
a full confession to her. He is a murderer. He killed an old woman, a
pawnbroker, with whom he had pawned things himself. He killed her sister
too, a pedlar woman called Lizaveta, who happened to come in while he
was murdering her sister. He killed them with an axe he brought with
him. He murdered them to rob them and he did rob them. He took money and
various things.... He told all this, word for word, to Sofya Semyonovna,
the only person who knows his secret. But she has had no share by word
or deed in the murder; she was as horrified at it as you are now. Donâ€™t
NA
NA
â€œIt cannot be. There was not the slightest cause, no sort of ground....
NA
â€œHe robbed her, that was the cause, he took money and things. Itâ€™s true
that by his own admission he made no use of the money or things, but hid
them under a stone, where they are now. But that was because he dared

NA
and she jumped up from the chair. â€œWhy, you know him, and youâ€™ve seen
NA
She seemed to be imploring SvidrigaÃ¯lov; she had entirely forgotten her
fear.
â€œThere are thousands and millions of combinations and possibilities,
Avdotya Romanovna. A thief steals and knows he is a scoundrel, but Iâ€™ve
heard of a gentleman who broke open the mail. Who knows, very likely he
thought he was doing a gentlemanly thing! Of course I should not have
believed it myself if Iâ€™d been told of it as you have, but I believe my
own ears. He explained all the causes of it to Sofya Semyonovna too, but
she did not believe her ears at first, yet she believed her own eyes at
NA
NA
â€œItâ€™s a long story, Avdotya Romanovna. Hereâ€™s... how shall I tell
you?--A theory of a sort, the same one by which I for instance consider
that a single misdeed is permissible if the principal aim is right, a
solitary wrongdoing and hundreds of good deeds! Itâ€™s galling too, of
course, for a young man of gifts and overweening pride to know that if
he had, for instance, a paltry three thousand, his whole career, his
whole future would be differently shaped and yet not to have that three
thousand. Add to that, nervous irritability from hunger, from lodging
in a hole, from rags, from a vivid sense of the charm of his social
position and his sisterâ€™s and motherâ€™s position too. Above all, vanity,
pride and vanity, though goodness knows he may have good qualities
too.... I am not blaming him, please donâ€™t think it; besides, itâ€™s not
my business. A special little theory came in too--a theory of a
sort--dividing mankind, you see, into material and superior persons,
that is persons to whom the law does not apply owing to their
superiority, who make laws for the rest of mankind, the material, that
is. Itâ€™s all right as a theory, _une thÃ©orie comme une autre_. Napoleon
attracted him tremendously, that is, what affected him was that a
great many men of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing, but have
overstepped the law without thinking about it. He seems to have fancied
that he was a genius too--that is, he was convinced of it for a time. He
has suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he
could make a theory, but was incapable of boldly overstepping the law,
and so he is not a man of genius. And thatâ€™s humiliating for a young man
NA
NA
â€œAh, Avdotya Romanovna, everything is in a muddle now; not that it was
ever in very good order. Russians in general are broad in their ideas,
Avdotya Romanovna, broad like their land and exceedingly disposed to
the fantastic, the chaotic. But itâ€™s a misfortune to be broad without
a special genius. Do you remember what a lot of talk we had together on
this subject, sitting in the evenings on the terrace after supper? Why,
you used to reproach me with breadth! Who knows, perhaps we were talking
at the very time when he was lying here thinking over his plan. There
are no sacred traditions amongst us, especially in the educated class,
Avdotya Romanovna. At the best someone will make them up somehow for
himself out of books or from some old chronicle. But those are for the
most part the learned and all old fogeys, so that it would be almost
ill-bred in a man of society. You know my opinions in general, though. I
never blame anyone. I do nothing at all, I persevere in that. But
weâ€™ve talked of this more than once before. I was so happy indeed as to

â€œI know his theory. I read that article of his about men to whom all is

â€œMr. Razumihin? Your brotherâ€™s article? In a magazine? Is there such an
article? I didnâ€™t know. It must be interesting. But where are you going,

Avdotya Romanovna could not finish. Her breath literally failed her.
â€œSofya Semyonovna will not be back till night, at least I believe not.
She was to have been back at once, but if not, then she will not be in

â€œAh, then you are lying! I see... you were lying... lying all the

completely losing her head.
Almost fainting, she sank on to a chair which SvidrigaÃ¯lov made haste to
give her.
â€œAvdotya Romanovna, what is it? Control yourself! Here is some water.
NA
He sprinkled some water over her. Dounia shuddered and came to herself.
NA
â€œAvdotya Romanovna, calm yourself! Believe me, he has friends. We will
save him. Would you like me to take him abroad? I have money, I can get
a ticket in three days. And as for the murder, he will do all sorts of
good deeds yet, to atone for it. Calm yourself. He may become a great

NA
â€œWe couldnâ€™t be shouting all over the flat on such a subject. I am far
from jeering; itâ€™s simply that Iâ€™m sick of talking like this. But how
can you go in such a state? Do you want to betray him? You will drive
him to fury, and he will give himself up. Let me tell you, he is already
being watched; they are already on his track. You will simply be giving
him away. Wait a little: I saw him and was talking to him just now. He
can still be saved. Wait a bit, sit down; let us think it over together.

eyes, almost in a whisper and hardly able to utter the words for
emotion.
Dounia drew back from him in alarm. He too was trembling all over.
â€œYou... one word from you, and he is saved. I... Iâ€™ll save him. I have
money and friends. Iâ€™ll send him away at once. Iâ€™ll get a passport,
two passports, one for him and one for me. I have friends... capable
people.... If you like, Iâ€™ll take a passport for you... for your
mother.... What do you want with Razumihin? I love you too.... I love
you beyond everything.... Let me kiss the hem of your dress, let me, let
me.... The very rustle of it is too much for me. Tell me, â€˜do that,â€™
and Iâ€™ll do it. Iâ€™ll do everything. I will do the impossible. What you
believe, I will believe. Iâ€™ll do anything--anything! Donâ€™t, donâ€™t look
NA
He was almost beginning to rave.... Something seemed suddenly to go to
his head. Dounia jumped up and rushed to the door.
NA
NA
SvidrigaÃ¯lov got up and came to himself. His still trembling lips slowly
broke into an angry mocking smile.
NA
landlady has gone out, and itâ€™s waste of time to shout like that. You

to the furthest corner, where she made haste to barricade herself with a
little table.
She did not scream, but she fixed her eyes on her tormentor and watched
every movement he made.
SvidrigaÃ¯lov remained standing at the other end of the room facing her.
He was positively composed, at least in appearance, but his face was
pale as before. The mocking smile did not leave his face.
â€œYou spoke of outrage just now, Avdotya Romanovna. In that case you
may be sure Iâ€™ve taken measures. Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. The
Kapernaumovs are far away--there are five locked rooms between. I am at
least twice as strong as you are and I have nothing to fear, besides.
For you could not complain afterwards. You surely would not be willing
actually to betray your brother? Besides, no one would believe you. How
should a girl have come alone to visit a solitary man in his lodgings?
So that even if you do sacrifice your brother, you could prove nothing.
NA
NA
â€œAs you like, but observe I was only speaking by way of a general
proposition. Itâ€™s my personal conviction that you are perfectly
right--violence is hateful. I only spoke to show you that you need have
no remorse even if... you were willing to save your brother of your
own accord, as I suggest to you. You would be simply submitting to
circumstances, to violence, in fact, if we must use that word. Think
about it. Your brotherâ€™s and your motherâ€™s fate are in your hands. I
NA
SvidrigaÃ¯lov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from Dounia. She had
not the slightest doubt now of his unbending determination. Besides, she
knew him. Suddenly she pulled out of her pocket a revolver, cocked it
and laid it in her hand on the table. SvidrigaÃ¯lov jumped up.
NA
â€œWell, that completely alters the aspect of affairs. Youâ€™ve made things
wonderfully easier for me, Avdotya Romanovna. But where did you get the
revolver? Was it Mr. Razumihin? Why, itâ€™s my revolver, an old friend!
And how Iâ€™ve hunted for it! The shooting lessons Iâ€™ve given you in the

â€œEven if that were true, it would have been for your sake... you would

NA
â€œOho, Avdotya Romanovna! You seem to have forgotten how you softened

â€œA lie? Well, if you like, itâ€™s a lie. I made it up. Women ought not

NA
Dounia raised the revolver, and deadly pale, gazed at him, measuring the
distance and awaiting the first movement on his part. Her lower lip was
white and quivering and her big black eyes flashed like fire. He had
never seen her so handsome. The fire glowing in her eyes at the moment
she raised the revolver seemed to kindle him and there was a pang of
anguish in his heart. He took a step forward and a shot rang out. The
bullet grazed his hair and flew into the wall behind. He stood still and
laughed softly.
â€œThe wasp has stung me. She aimed straight at my head. Whatâ€™s this?
NA
in a thin stream down his right temple. The bullet seemed to have just
grazed the skin.
Dounia lowered the revolver and looked at SvidrigaÃ¯lov not so much in
terror as in a sort of wild amazement. She seemed not to understand what
she was doing and what was going on.
NA
still smiling, but gloomily. â€œIf you go on like that, I shall have time
NA
Dounia started, quickly cocked the pistol and again raised it.
NA
NA
â€œWell... at three paces you can hardly help it. But if you donâ€™t...
NA
again: it missed fire.
â€œYou havenâ€™t loaded it properly. Never mind, you have another charge

He stood facing her, two paces away, waiting and gazing at her with wild
determination, with feverishly passionate, stubborn, set eyes. Dounia
saw that he would sooner die than let her go. â€œAnd... now, of course she

breath. A weight seemed to have rolled from his heart--perhaps not only
the fear of death; indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment.
It was the deliverance from another feeling, darker and more bitter,
which he could not himself have defined.
He went to Dounia and gently put his arm round her waist. She did not
resist, but, trembling like a leaf, looked at him with suppliant eyes.
He tried to say something, but his lips moved without being able to
utter a sound.
NA
quite different.
NA
NA
NA
There followed a moment of terrible, dumb struggle in the heart of
SvidrigaÃ¯lov. He looked at her with an indescribable gaze. Suddenly
he withdrew his arm, turned quickly to the window and stood facing it.
Another moment passed.
NA
He took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table
behind him, without turning or looking at Dounia.
NA
He looked stubbornly out of the window. Dounia went up to the table to
take the key.
NA
or moving. But there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of that
NA
Dounia understood it, snatched up the key, flew to the door, unlocked it
quickly and rushed out of the room. A minute later, beside herself, she
ran out on to the canal bank in the direction of X. Bridge.
SvidrigaÃ¯lov remained three minutes standing at the window. At last he
slowly turned, looked about him and passed his hand over his forehead. A
strange smile contorted his face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile of
despair. The blood, which was already getting dry, smeared his hand.
He looked angrily at it, then wetted a towel and washed his temple.
The revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenly
caught his eye. He picked it up and examined it. It was a little pocket
three-barrel revolver of old-fashioned construction. There were still
two charges and one capsule left in it. It could be fired again. He
thought a little, put the revolver in his pocket, took his hat and went
out.
CHAPTER VI
He spent that evening till ten oâ€™clock going from one low haunt to
another. Katia too turned up and sang another gutter song, how a certain
NA
NA
SvidrigaÃ¯lov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and some singers and
the waiters and two little clerks. He was particularly drawn to these
clerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses, one bent to the
left and the other to the right. They took him finally to a pleasure
garden, where he paid for their entrance. There was one lanky
three-year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a
NA
served, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it.
A chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed
German clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the public. The
clerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent.
SvidrigaÃ¯lov was chosen to decide the dispute. He listened to them for
a quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that there was no
possibility of understanding them. The only fact that seemed certain was
that one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in
selling it on the spot to a Jew, but would not share the spoil with his
companion. Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon
belonging to the Vauxhall. It was missed and the affair began to seem
troublesome. SvidrigaÃ¯lov paid for the spoon, got up, and walked out of
the garden. It was about six oâ€™clock. He had not drunk a drop of wine
all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than
anything.
It was a dark and stifling evening. Threatening storm-clouds came over
the sky about ten oâ€™clock. There was a clap of thunder, and the rain
came down like a waterfall. The water fell not in drops, but beat on the
earth in streams. There were flashes of lightning every minute and each
flash lasted while one could count five.
Drenched to the skin, he went home, locked himself in, opened the
bureau, took out all his money and tore up two or three papers. Then,
putting the money in his pocket, he was about to change his clothes,
but, looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the
rain, he gave up the idea, took up his hat and went out of the room
without locking the door. He went straight to Sonia. She was at home.
She was not alone: the four Kapernaumov children were with her. She
was giving them tea. She received SvidrigaÃ¯lov in respectful silence,
looking wonderingly at his soaking clothes. The children all ran away at
once in indescribable terror.
SvidrigaÃ¯lov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit beside him.
She timidly prepared to listen.
NA
as I am probably seeing you for the last time, I have come to make some
arrangements. Well, did you see the lady to-day? I know what she said to

people have their own way of doing things. As to your sisters and your
brother, they are really provided for and the money assigned to them
Iâ€™ve put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments. You had
better take charge of the receipts, in case anything happens. Here, take
them! Well now, thatâ€™s settled. Here are three 5-per-cent bonds to the
value of three thousand roubles. Take those for yourself, entirely for
yourself, and let that be strictly between ourselves, so that no one
knows of it, whatever you hear. You will need the money, for to go on
living in the old way, Sofya Semyonovna, is bad, and besides there is no

when you told him to give himself up and confess. It would be much
better for him. Well, if it turns out to be Siberia, he will go and
you will follow him. Thatâ€™s so, isnâ€™t it? And if so, youâ€™ll need money.
Youâ€™ll need it for him, do you understand? Giving it to you is the same
as my giving it to him. Besides, you promised Amalia Ivanovna to pay
whatâ€™s owing. I heard you. How can you undertake such obligations so
heedlessly, Sofya Semyonovna? It was Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s debt and not
yours, so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman.

about me--to-morrow or the day after you will be asked--donâ€™t say

course you do. Heâ€™s not a bad fellow. Take it to him to-morrow or...
NA
Sonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at SvidrigaÃ¯lov.
She longed to speak, to ask a question, but for the first moments she
did not dare and did not know how to begin.
NA
â€œWhy, be starting for America, and be stopped by rain! Ha, ha! Good-bye,
Sofya Semyonovna, my dear! Live and live long, you will be of use to
others. By the way... tell Mr. Razumihin I send my greetings to him.
Tell him Arkady Ivanovitch SvidrigaÃ¯lov sends his greetings. Be sure
NA
He went out, leaving Sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague
apprehension.
It appeared afterwards that on the same evening, at twenty past eleven,
he made another very eccentric and unexpected visit. The rain still
persisted. Drenched to the skin, he walked into the little flat where
the parents of his betrothed lived, in Third Street in Vassilyevsky
Island. He knocked some time before he was admitted, and his visit
at first caused great perturbation; but SvidrigaÃ¯lov could be
very fascinating when he liked, so that the first, and indeed very
intelligent surmise of the sensible parents that SvidrigaÃ¯lov had
probably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing
vanished immediately. The decrepit father was wheeled in to see
SvidrigaÃ¯lov by the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began the
conversation with various irrelevant questions. She never asked a direct
question, but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then, if she
were obliged to ascertain something--for instance, when SvidrigaÃ¯lov
would like to have the wedding--she would begin by interested and
almost eager questions about Paris and the court life there, and only
by degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street. On other
occasions this had of course been very impressive, but this time Arkady
Ivanovitch seemed particularly impatient, and insisted on seeing his
betrothed at once, though he had been informed, to begin with, that she
had already gone to bed. The girl of course appeared.
SvidrigaÃ¯lov informed her at once that he was obliged by very important
affairs to leave Petersburg for a time, and therefore brought her
fifteen thousand roubles and begged her accept them as a present from
him, as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present
before their wedding. The logical connection of the present with his
immediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that
purpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear. But it all went
off very well; even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret,
the inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained. On the
other hand, the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforced
by tears from the most sensible of mothers. SvidrigaÃ¯lov got up,
laughed, kissed his betrothed, patted her cheek, declared he would soon
come back, and noticing in her eyes, together with childish curiosity, a
sort of earnest dumb inquiry, reflected and kissed her again, though
he felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be
immediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers. He
went away, leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement, but
the tender mamma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some of
the most important of their doubts, concluding that SvidrigaÃ¯lov was
a great man, a man of great affairs and connections and of great
wealth--there was no knowing what he had in his mind. He would start
off on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him, so that
there was nothing surprising about it. Of course it was strange that he
was wet through, but Englishmen, for instance, are even more eccentric,
and all these people of high society didnâ€™t think of what was said of
them and didnâ€™t stand on ceremony. Possibly, indeed, he came like that
on purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone. Above all, not a
word should be said about it, for God knows what might come of it, and
the money must be locked up, and it was most fortunate that Fedosya, the
cook, had not left the kitchen. And above all not a word must be said
to that old cat, Madame Resslich, and so on and so on. They sat up
whispering till two oâ€™clock, but the girl went to bed much earlier,
amazed and rather sorrowful.
SvidrigaÃ¯lov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed the bridge on the
way back to the mainland. The rain had ceased and there was a roaring
wind. He began shivering, and for one moment he gazed at the black
waters of the Little Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry.
But he soon felt it very cold, standing by the water; he turned and
went towards Y. Prospect. He walked along that endless street for a long
time, almost half an hour, more than once stumbling in the dark on the
wooden pavement, but continually looking for something on the right side
of the street. He had noticed passing through this street lately that
there was a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but fairly
large, and its name he remembered was something like Adrianople. He was
not mistaken: the hotel was so conspicuous in that God-forsaken place
that he could not fail to see it even in the dark. It was a long,
blackened wooden building, and in spite of the late hour there were
lights in the windows and signs of life within. He went in and asked
a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room. The latter,
scanning SvidrigaÃ¯lov, pulled himself together and led him at once to a
close and tiny room in the distance, at the end of the corridor, under
the stairs. There was no other, all were occupied. The ragged fellow
looked inquiringly.

The ragged man went away, completely disillusioned.
NA
know it? I expect I look as if I came from a cafÃ© chantant and have
had some adventure on the way. It would be interesting to know who stayed
NA
He lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully. It was a
room so low-pitched that SvidrigaÃ¯lov could only just stand up in it;
it had one window; the bed, which was very dirty, and the plain-stained
chair and table almost filled it up. The walls looked as though they
were made of planks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dusty
that the pattern was indistinguishable, though the general
colour--yellow--could still be made out. One of the walls was cut short
by the sloping ceiling, though the room was not an attic but just under
the stairs.
SvidrigaÃ¯lov set down the candle, sat down on the bed and sank into
thought. But a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout
in the next room attracted his attention. The murmur had not ceased from
the moment he entered the room. He listened: someone was upbraiding and
almost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one voice.
SvidrigaÃ¯lov got up, shaded the light with his hand and at once he saw
light through a crack in the wall; he went up and peeped through. The
room, which was somewhat larger than his, had two occupants. One of
them, a very curly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing
in the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide apart to
preserve his balance, and smiting himself on the breast. He reproached
the other with being a beggar, with having no standing whatever. He
declared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn
him out when he liked, and that only the finger of Providence sees it
all. The object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair, and had the
air of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze, but canâ€™t. He sometimes
turned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker, but obviously had not
the slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it. A
candle was burning down on the table; there were wine-glasses, a nearly
empty bottle of vodka, bread and cucumber, and glasses with the dregs
of stale tea. After gazing attentively at this, SvidrigaÃ¯lov turned away
indifferently and sat down on the bed.
The ragged attendant, returning with the tea, could not resist asking
him again whether he didnâ€™t want anything more, and again receiving a
negative reply, finally withdrew. SvidrigaÃ¯lov made haste to drink a
glass of tea to warm himself, but could not eat anything. He began
to feel feverish. He took off his coat and, wrapping himself in the
blanket, lay down on the bed. He was annoyed. â€œIt would have been better
NA
close, the candle burnt dimly, the wind was roaring outside, he heard
a mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mice and of
leather. He lay in a sort of reverie: one thought followed another. He
felt a longing to fix his imagination on something. â€œIt must be a garden

the sound of trees on a stormy night, in the dark! They give one a

Petrovsky Park just now. This reminded him of the bridge over the Little
Neva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there. â€œI never have

again at a strange idea: â€œSurely now all these questions of taste and
comfort ought not to matter, but Iâ€™ve become more particular, like an
animal that picks out a special place... for such an occasion. I ought
to have gone into the Petrovsky Park! I suppose it seemed dark, cold,
ha-ha! As though I were seeking pleasant sensations!... By the way, why

He suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out his design on
Dounia, he had recommended Raskolnikov to trust her to Razumihinâ€™s
keeping. â€œI suppose I really did say it, as Raskolnikov guessed, to
tease myself. But what a rogue that Raskolnikov is! Heâ€™s gone through a
good deal. He may be a successful rogue in time when heâ€™s got over
his nonsense. But now heâ€™s _too_ eager for life. These young men
are contemptible on that point. But, hang the fellow! Let him please
NA
He could not get to sleep. By degrees Douniaâ€™s image rose before him,
NA
thought, rousing himself. â€œI must think of something else. Itâ€™s queer
and funny. I never had a great hatred for anyone, I never particularly
desired to avenge myself even, and thatâ€™s a bad sign, a bad sign, a bad
sign. I never liked quarrelling either, and never lost my temper--thatâ€™s
a bad sign too. And the promises I made her just now, too--Damnation!
But--who knows?--perhaps she would have made a new man of me
NA
He ground his teeth and sank into silence again. Again Douniaâ€™s image
rose before him, just as she was when, after shooting the first time,
she had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him, so that
he might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand
to defend herself if he had not reminded her. He recalled how at that
instant he felt almost sorry for her, how he had felt a pang at his
heart...
NA
He was dozing off; the feverish shiver had ceased, when suddenly
something seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes. He

NA
blanket, get up, get cold, but all at once something unpleasant ran over
his leg again. He pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle. Shaking
with feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed: there was nothing.
He shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet.
He tried to catch it, but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without
leaving the bed, slipped between his fingers, ran over his hand and
suddenly darted under the pillow. He threw down the pillow, but in one
instant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and down
his back under his shirt. He trembled nervously and woke up.
The room was dark. He was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket
NA
thought with annoyance.
He got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the
NA
damp draught from the window, however; without getting up he drew the
blanket over him and wrapped himself in it. He was not thinking of
anything and did not want to think. But one image rose after another,
incoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end passed through his
mind. He sank into drowsiness. Perhaps the cold, or the dampness, or
the dark, or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees
roused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic. He kept dwelling
on images of flowers, he fancied a charming flower garden, a bright,
warm, almost hot day, a holiday--Trinity day. A fine, sumptuous country
cottage in the English taste overgrown with fragrant flowers, with
flower beds going round the house; the porch, wreathed in climbers, was
surrounded with beds of roses. A light, cool staircase, carpeted with
rich rugs, was decorated with rare plants in china pots. He noticed
particularly in the windows nosegays of tender, white, heavily fragrant
narcissus bending over their bright, green, thick long stalks. He was
reluctant to move away from them, but he went up the stairs and came
into a large, high drawing-room and again everywhere--at the windows,
the doors on to the balcony, and on the balcony itself--were flowers.
The floors were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant hay, the windows
were open, a fresh, cool, light air came into the room. The birds were
chirruping under the window, and in the middle of the room, on a table
covered with a white satin shroud, stood a coffin. The coffin was
covered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths of
flowers surrounded it on all sides. Among the flowers lay a girl in a
white muslin dress, with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom, as
though carved out of marble. But her loose fair hair was wet; there was
a wreath of roses on her head. The stern and already rigid profile of
her face looked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on her
pale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal.
SvidrigaÃ¯lov knew that girl; there was no holy image, no burning candle
beside the coffin; no sound of prayers: the girl had drowned herself.
She was only fourteen, but her heart was broken. And she had destroyed
herself, crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish
soul, had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn
from her a last scream of despair, unheeded and brutally disregarded, on
a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled....
SvidrigaÃ¯lov came to himself, got up from the bed and went to the
window. He felt for the latch and opened it. The wind lashed furiously
into the little room and stung his face and his chest, only covered with
his shirt, as though with frost. Under the window there must have been
something like a garden, and apparently a pleasure garden. There, too,
probably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime. Now drops of
rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes; it was dark as
in a cellar, so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of
objects. SvidrigaÃ¯lov, bending down with elbows on the window-sill,
gazed for five minutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followed
by a second one, resounded in the darkness of the night. â€œAh, the
NA
swirling down the street in the lower parts, flooding the basements and
cellars. The cellar rats will swim out, and men will curse in the rain
and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys. What time is

the wall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three.
â€œAha! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? Iâ€™ll go out at once
straight to the park. Iâ€™ll choose a great bush there drenched with rain,
so that as soon as oneâ€™s shoulder touches it, millions of drops drip on
NA
He moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the candle, put on his
waistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and went out, carrying the candle,
into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep
somewhere in the midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay
him for the room and leave the hotel. â€œItâ€™s the best minute; I couldnâ€™t
NA
He walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding
anyone and was just going to call out, when suddenly in a dark corner
between an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object
which seemed to be alive. He bent down with the candle and saw a little
girl, not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her
clothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel. She did not seem afraid of
SvidrigaÃ¯lov, but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big
black eyes. Now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been
crying a long time, but are beginning to be comforted. The childâ€™s face
was pale and tired, she was numb with cold. â€œHow can she have come here?
NA
her. The child suddenly becoming animated, chattered away in her baby
NA
NA
stopping. He could only guess from what she said that she was a
neglected child, whose mother, probably a drunken cook, in the service
of the hotel, whipped and frightened her; that the child had broken
a cup of her motherâ€™s and was so frightened that she had run away the
evening before, had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the
rain, at last had made her way in here, hidden behind the cupboard and
spent the night there, crying and trembling from the damp, the darkness
and the fear that she would be badly beaten for it. He took her in his
arms, went back to his room, sat her on the bed, and began undressing
her. The torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as
wet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night. When he had
undressed her, he put her on the bed, covered her up and wrapped her in
the blanket from her head downwards. She fell asleep at once. Then he
sank into dreary musing again.
NA
NA
to go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away.
NA
to see whether the child was asleep. He raised the blanket carefully.
The child was sleeping soundly, she had got warm under the blanket,
and her pale cheeks were flushed. But strange to say that flush seemed
brighter and coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood. â€œItâ€™s a flush
NA
though she had been given a full glass to drink. Her crimson lips were
hot and glowing; but what was this? He suddenly fancied that her long
black eyelashes were quivering, as though the lids were opening and a
sly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink, as though the little
girl were not asleep, but pretending. Yes, it was so. Her lips parted in
a smile. The corners of her mouth quivered, as though she were trying to
control them. But now she quite gave up all effort, now it was a grin,
a broad grin; there was something shameless, provocative in that quite
unchildish face; it was depravity, it was the face of a harlot, the
shameless face of a French harlot. Now both eyes opened wide; they
turned a glowing, shameless glance upon him; they laughed, invited
him.... There was something infinitely hideous and shocking in that
laugh, in those eyes, in such nastiness in the face of a child. â€œWhat,

NA

to strike her, but at that moment he woke up.
He was in the same bed, still wrapped in the blanket. The candle had not
been lighted, and daylight was streaming in at the windows.

shattered; his bones ached. There was a thick mist outside and he could
see nothing. It was nearly five. He had overslept himself! He got up,
put on his still damp jacket and overcoat. Feeling the revolver in his
pocket, he took it out and then he sat down, took a notebook out of his
pocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few
lines in large letters. Reading them over, he sank into thought with his
elbows on the table. The revolver and the notebook lay beside him. Some
flies woke up and settled on the untouched veal, which was still on
the table. He stared at them and at last with his free right hand began
trying to catch one. He tried till he was tired, but could not catch it.
At last, realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit, he
started, got up and walked resolutely out of the room. A minute later he
was in the street.
A thick milky mist hung over the town. SvidrigaÃ¯lov walked along the
slippery dirty wooden pavement towards the Little Neva. He was picturing
the waters of the Little Neva swollen in the night, Petrovsky Island,
the wet paths, the wet grass, the wet trees and bushes and at last the
bush.... He began ill-humouredly staring at the houses, trying to think
of something else. There was not a cabman or a passer-by in the street.
The bright yellow, wooden, little houses looked dirty and dejected with
their closed shutters. The cold and damp penetrated his whole body and
he began to shiver. From time to time he came across shop signs and read
each carefully. At last he reached the end of the wooden pavement and
came to a big stone house. A dirty, shivering dog crossed his path with
its tail between its legs. A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; dead
drunk, across the pavement. He looked at him and went on. A high tower
NA

NA
He almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where
there was the big house with the tower. At the great closed gates of
the house, a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them,
wrapped in a grey soldierâ€™s coat, with a copper Achilles helmet on his
head. He cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at SvidrigaÃ¯lov. His
face wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection, which is so sourly
printed on all faces of Jewish race without exception. They both,
SvidrigaÃ¯lov and Achilles, stared at each other for a few minutes
without speaking. At last it struck Achilles as irregular for a man
not drunk to be standing three steps from him, staring and not saying a
word.

CHAPTER VII
The same day, about seven oâ€™clock in the evening, Raskolnikov was on
his way to his motherâ€™s and sisterâ€™s lodging--the lodging in Bakaleyevâ€™s
house which Razumihin had found for them. The stairs went up from
the street. Raskolnikov walked with lagging steps, as though still
hesitating whether to go or not. But nothing would have turned him back:
his decision was taken.
NA
NA
He was appallingly dressed: his clothes torn and dirty, soaked with a
nightâ€™s rain. His face was almost distorted from fatigue, exposure, the
inward conflict that had lasted for twenty-four hours. He had spent all
the previous night alone, God knows where. But anyway he had reached a
decision.
He knocked at the door which was opened by his mother. Dounia was not
at home. Even the servant happened to be out. At first Pulcheria
Alexandrovna was speechless with joy and surprise; then she took him by
the hand and drew him into the room.
NA
me, Rodya, for welcoming you so foolishly with tears: I am laughing not
crying. Did you think I was crying? No, I am delighted, but Iâ€™ve got
into such a stupid habit of shedding tears. Iâ€™ve been like that ever
since your fatherâ€™s death. I cry for anything. Sit down, dear boy, you

NA
NA
was going to cross-question you in the womanish way I used to; donâ€™t be
anxious, I understand, I understand it all: now Iâ€™ve learned the ways
here and truly I see for myself that they are better. Iâ€™ve made up my
mind once for all: how could I understand your plans and expect you to
give an account of them? God knows what concerns and plans you may have,
or what ideas you are hatching; so itâ€™s not for me to keep nudging your
elbow, asking you what you are thinking about? But, my goodness! why
am I running to and fro as though I were crazy...? I am reading your
article in the magazine for the third time, Rodya. Dmitri Prokofitch
brought it to me. Directly I saw it I cried out to myself: â€˜There,
foolish one,â€™ I thought, â€˜thatâ€™s what he is busy about; thatâ€™s the
solution of the mystery! Learned people are always like that. He may
have some new ideas in his head just now; he is thinking them over and I
worry him and upset him.â€™ I read it, my dear, and of course there was a
NA
NA
Raskolnikov took the magazine and glanced at his article. Incongruous
as it was with his mood and his circumstances, he felt that strange and
bitter sweet sensation that every author experiences the first time he
sees himself in print; besides, he was only twenty-three. It lasted only
a moment. After reading a few lines he frowned and his heart throbbed
with anguish. He recalled all the inward conflict of the preceding
months. He flung the article on the table with disgust and anger.
â€œBut, however foolish I may be, Rodya, I can see for myself that you
will very soon be one of the leading--if not the leading man--in the
world of Russian thought. And they dared to think you were mad! You
donâ€™t know, but they really thought that. Ah, the despicable creatures,
how could they understand genius! And Dounia, Dounia was all but
believing it--what do you say to that? Your father sent twice to
magazines--the first time poems (Iâ€™ve got the manuscript and will show
you) and the second time a whole novel (I begged him to let me copy it
out) and how we prayed that they should be taken--they werenâ€™t! I was
breaking my heart, Rodya, six or seven days ago over your food and your
clothes and the way you are living. But now I see again how foolish
I was, for you can attain any position you like by your intellect and
talent. No doubt you donâ€™t care about that for the present and you are
NA
NA
â€œNo, Rodya. I often donâ€™t see her; she leaves me alone. Dmitri
Prokofitch comes to see me, itâ€™s so good of him, and he always talks
about you. He loves you and respects you, my dear. I donâ€™t say that
Dounia is very wanting in consideration. I am not complaining. She has
her ways and I have mine; she seems to have got some secrets of late and
I never have any secrets from you two. Of course, I am sure that Dounia
has far too much sense, and besides she loves you and me... but I donâ€™t
know what it will all lead to. Youâ€™ve made me so happy by coming now,
Rodya, but she has missed you by going out; when she comes in Iâ€™ll tell
her: â€˜Your brother came in while you were out. Where have you been all
this time?â€™ You mustnâ€™t spoil me, Rodya, you know; come when you can,
but if you canâ€™t, it doesnâ€™t matter, I can wait. I shall know, anyway,
that you are fond of me, that will be enough for me. I shall read what
you write, I shall hear about you from everyone, and sometimes youâ€™ll
come yourself to see me. What could be better? Here youâ€™ve come now to

Here Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.
â€œHere I am again! Donâ€™t mind my foolishness. My goodness, why am I

â€œMother, donâ€™t trouble, I am going at once. I havenâ€™t come for that.

Pulcheria Alexandrovna went up to him timidly.
â€œMother, whatever happens, whatever you hear about me, whatever you are

from the fullness of his heart, as though not thinking of his words and
not weighing them.
â€œRodya, Rodya, what is the matter? How can you ask me such a question?
Why, who will tell me anything about you? Besides, I shouldnâ€™t believe

must believe that your son loves you now more than himself, and that all
you thought about me, that I was cruel and didnâ€™t care about you, was

Pulcheria Alexandrovna embraced him in silence, pressing him to her
bosom and weeping gently.

been thinking all this time that we were simply boring you and now I see
that there is a great sorrow in store for you, and thatâ€™s why you are
miserable. Iâ€™ve foreseen it a long time, Rodya. Forgive me for speaking
about it. I keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights. Your sister
lay talking in her sleep all last night, talking of nothing but you. I
caught something, but I couldnâ€™t make it out. I felt all the morning
as though I were going to be hanged, waiting for something, expecting
something, and now it has come! Rodya, Rodya, where are you going? You
NA
NA
â€œThatâ€™s what I thought! I can come with you, you know, if you need
me. And Dounia, too; she loves you, she loves you dearly--and Sofya
Semyonovna may come with us if you like. You see, I am glad to look upon
her as a daughter even... Dmitri Prokofitch will help us to go together.

â€œNo, but kneel down and pray to God for me. Your prayer perhaps will

Yes, he was glad, he was very glad that there was no one there, that
he was alone with his mother. For the first time after all those awful
months his heart was softened. He fell down before her, he kissed her
feet and both wept, embracing. And she was not surprised and did not
question him this time. For some days she had realised that something
awful was happening to her son and that now some terrible minute had
come for him.

as when you were little. You would run like this to me and hug me and
kiss me. When your father was living and we were poor, you comforted us
simply by being with us and when I buried your father, how often we
wept together at his grave and embraced, as now. And if Iâ€™ve been crying
lately, itâ€™s that my motherâ€™s heart had a foreboding of trouble. The
first time I saw you, that evening, you remember, as soon as we arrived
here, I guessed simply from your eyes. My heart sank at once, and to-day
when I opened the door and looked at you, I thought the fatal hour had

with terror.

â€œNot for ever, itâ€™s not yet for ever? Youâ€™ll come, youâ€™ll come

It was a warm, fresh, bright evening; it had cleared up in the morning.
Raskolnikov went to his lodgings; he made haste. He wanted to finish all
before sunset. He did not want to meet anyone till then. Going up the
stairs he noticed that Nastasya rushed from the samovar to watch him
NA
disgusted vision of Porfiry. But opening his door he saw Dounia. She
was sitting alone, plunged in deep thought, and looked as though she had
been waiting a long time. He stopped short in the doorway. She rose from
the sofa in dismay and stood up facing him. Her eyes, fixed upon him,
betrayed horror and infinite grief. And from those eyes alone he saw at
once that she knew.
NA
â€œIâ€™ve been all day with Sofya Semyonovna. We were both waiting for you.
NA
Raskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on a chair.
â€œI feel weak, Dounia, I am very tired; and I should have liked at this

He glanced at her mistrustfully.
NA
â€œI donâ€™t remember clearly. You see, sister, I wanted to make up my mind
once for all, and several times I walked by the Neva, I remember that

whispered, looking at her mistrustfully again.
â€œThank God! That was just what we were afraid of, Sofya Semyonovna and
NA
Raskolnikov smiled bitterly.
â€œI havenâ€™t faith, but I have just been weeping in motherâ€™s arms; I
havenâ€™t faith, but I have just asked her to pray for me. I donâ€™t know
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo, I didnâ€™t tell her... in words; but she understood a great deal.
She heard you talking in your sleep. I am sure she half understands it
already. Perhaps I did wrong in going to see her. I donâ€™t know why I did

â€œA contemptible person, but ready to face suffering! You are, arenâ€™t

drowning myself, Dounia, but as I looked into the water, I thought that

There was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes; he seemed to be glad
to think that he was still proud.

minutes. He sat with his eyes fixed on the floor; Dounia stood at the
other end of the table and looked at him with anguish. Suddenly he got
up.

noxious insect, an old pawnbroker woman, of use to no one!... Killing
her was atonement for forty sins. She was sucking the life out of poor
people. Was that a crime? I am not thinking of it and I am not thinking
of expiating it, and why are you all rubbing it in on all sides? â€˜A
crime! a crime!â€™ Only now I see clearly the imbecility of my cowardice,
now that I have decided to face this superfluous disgrace. Itâ€™s simply
because I am contemptible and have nothing in me that I have decided to,

always flowed in streams, which is spilt like champagne, and for which
men are crowned in the Capitol and are called afterwards benefactors of
mankind. Look into it more carefully and understand it! I too wanted to
do good to men and would have done hundreds, thousands of good deeds
to make up for that one piece of stupidity, not stupidity even, simply
clumsiness, for the idea was by no means so stupid as it seems now
that it has failed.... (Everything seems stupid when it fails.) By that
stupidity I only wanted to put myself into an independent position, to
take the first step, to obtain means, and then everything would have
been smoothed over by benefits immeasurable in comparison.... But I...
I couldnâ€™t carry out even the first step, because I am contemptible,
thatâ€™s whatâ€™s the matter! And yet I wonâ€™t look at it as you do. If I had

from seeing that what I did was a crime. Iâ€™ve never, never been stronger
NA
The colour had rushed into his pale exhausted face, but as he uttered
his last explanation, he happened to meet Douniaâ€™s eyes and he saw such
anguish in them that he could not help being checked. He felt that he
had, anyway, made these two poor women miserable, that he was, anyway,
the cause...
â€œDounia darling, if I am guilty forgive me (though I cannot be forgiven
if I am guilty). Good-bye! We wonâ€™t dispute. Itâ€™s time, high time to go.
Donâ€™t follow me, I beseech you, I have somewhere else to go.... But you
go at once and sit with mother. I entreat you to! Itâ€™s my last request
of you. Donâ€™t leave her at all; I left her in a state of anxiety, that
she is not fit to bear; she will die or go out of her mind. Be with
her! Razumihin will be with you. Iâ€™ve been talking to him.... Donâ€™t cry
about me: Iâ€™ll try to be honest and manly all my life, even if I am a
murderer. Perhaps I shall some day make a name. I wonâ€™t disgrace you,
NA
concluded hurriedly, noticing again a strange expression in Douniaâ€™s
eyes at his last words and promises. â€œWhy are you crying? Donâ€™t cry,
donâ€™t cry: we are not parting for ever! Ah, yes! Wait a minute, Iâ€™d

He went to the table, took up a thick dusty book, opened it and took
from between the pages a little water-colour portrait on ivory. It was
the portrait of his landladyâ€™s daughter, who had died of fever, that
strange girl who had wanted to be a nun. For a minute he gazed at the
delicate expressive face of his betrothed, kissed the portrait and gave
it to Dounia.
NA
thoughtfully. â€œTo her heart I confided much of what has since been so
NA
as much opposed to it as you, and I am glad that she is gone. The great
point is that everything now is going to be different, is going to

â€œEverything, everything, and am I prepared for it? Do I want it myself?

senseless sufferings? shall I know any better what they are for, when I

yearsâ€™ penal servitude? And what shall I have to live for then? Why am I
consenting to that life now? Oh, I knew I was contemptible when I stood

At last they both went out. It was hard for Dounia, but she loved him.
She walked away, but after going fifty paces she turned round to look
at him again. He was still in sight. At the corner he too turned and for
the last time their eyes met; but noticing that she was looking at him,
he motioned her away with impatience and even vexation, and turned the
corner abruptly.
NA
moment later of his angry gesture to Dounia. â€œBut why are they so fond
of me if I donâ€™t deserve it? Oh, if only I were alone and no one loved
me and I too had never loved anyone! _Nothing of all this would have
happened._ But I wonder shall I in those fifteen or twenty years grow so
meek that I shall humble myself before people and whimper at every word
that I am a criminal? Yes, thatâ€™s it, thatâ€™s it, thatâ€™s what they are
sending me there for, thatâ€™s what they want. Look at them running to and
fro about the streets, every one of them a scoundrel and a criminal at
heart and, worse still, an idiot. But try to get me off and theyâ€™d be

He fell to musing by what process it could come to pass, that he could
be humbled before all of them, indiscriminately--humbled by conviction.
And yet why not? It must be so. Would not twenty years of continual
bondage crush him utterly? Water wears out a stone. And why, why should
he live after that? Why should he go now when he knew that it would be
so? It was the hundredth time perhaps that he had asked himself that
question since the previous evening, but still he went.
CHAPTER VIII
When he went into Soniaâ€™s room, it was already getting dark. All day
Sonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety. Dounia had been
waiting with her. She had come to her that morning, remembering
SvidrigaÃ¯lovâ€™s words that Sonia knew. We will not describe the
conversation and tears of the two girls, and how friendly they became.
Dounia gained one comfort at least from that interview, that her
brother would not be alone. He had gone to her, Sonia, first with his
confession; he had gone to her for human fellowship when he needed it;
she would go with him wherever fate might send him. Dounia did not ask,
but she knew it was so. She looked at Sonia almost with reverence and
at first almost embarrassed her by it. Sonia was almost on the point
of tears. She felt herself, on the contrary, hardly worthy to look at
Dounia. Douniaâ€™s gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively
and respectfully at their first meeting in Raskolnikovâ€™s room had
remained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life.
Dounia at last became impatient and, leaving Sonia, went to her
brotherâ€™s room to await him there; she kept thinking that he would come
there first. When she had gone, Sonia began to be tortured by the dread
of his committing suicide, and Dounia too feared it. But they had spent
the day trying to persuade each other that that could not be, and both
were less anxious while they were together. As soon as they parted, each
thought of nothing else. Sonia remembered how SvidrigaÃ¯lov had said to
her the day before that Raskolnikov had two alternatives--Siberia or...
Besides she knew his vanity, his pride and his lack of faith.
â€œIs it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear of death to

Meanwhile the sun was setting. Sonia was standing in dejection, looking
intently out of the window, but from it she could see nothing but the
unwhitewashed blank wall of the next house. At last when she began to
feel sure of his death--he walked into the room.
She gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face she turned
pale.
NA
was you told me to go to the cross-roads; why is it you are frightened
NA
Sonia gazed at him astonished. His tone seemed strange to her; a cold
shiver ran over her, but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the
words were a mask. He spoke to her looking away, as though to avoid
meeting her eyes.
â€œYou see, Sonia, Iâ€™ve decided that it will be better so. There is one
fact.... But itâ€™s a long story and thereâ€™s no need to discuss it. But
do you know what angers me? It annoys me that all those stupid brutish
faces will be gaping at me directly, pestering me with their stupid
questions, which I shall have to answer--theyâ€™ll point their fingers at
me.... Tfoo! You know I am not going to Porfiry, I am sick of him. Iâ€™d
rather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how I shall surprise
him, what a sensation I shall make! But I must be cooler; Iâ€™ve become
too irritable of late. You know I was nearly shaking my fist at my
sister just now, because she turned to take a last look at me. Itâ€™s
a brutal state to be in! Ah! what am I coming to! Well, where are the

He seemed hardly to know what he was doing. He could not stay still or
concentrate his attention on anything; his ideas seemed to gallop after
one another, he talked incoherently, his hands trembled slightly.
Without a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, one of cypress
wood and one of copper. She made the sign of the cross over herself and
over him, and put the wooden cross on his neck.
NA
had not suffered much till now! The wooden cross, that is the peasant
one; the copper one, that is Lizavetaâ€™s--you will wear yourself, show
me! So she had it on... at that moment? I remember two things like
these too, a silver one and a little ikon. I threw them back on the old
womanâ€™s neck. Those would be appropriate now, really, those are what I
ought to put on now.... But I am talking nonsense and forgetting what
matters; Iâ€™m somehow forgetful.... You see I have come to warn you,
Sonia, so that you might know... thatâ€™s all--thatâ€™s all I came for. But
I thought I had more to say. You wanted me to go yourself. Well, now I
am going to prison and youâ€™ll have your wish. Well, what are you crying

But his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as he looked at her. â€œWhy

she weep? Why is she looking after me, like my mother or Dounia? Sheâ€™ll

But he wanted to say something quite different.
He crossed himself several times. Sonia took up her shawl and put
it over her head. It was the green _drap de dames_ shawl of which

looking at it, but he did not ask. He began to feel himself that he
was certainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated. He was
frightened at this. He was suddenly struck too by the thought that Sonia
meant to go with him.
â€œWhat are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here, stay! Iâ€™ll go
NA
NA
going out.
Sonia remained standing in the middle of the room. He had not even said
good-bye to her; he had forgotten her. A poignant and rebellious doubt
surged in his heart.
NA
NA
But still he went. He felt suddenly once for all that he mustnâ€™t ask
himself questions. As he turned into the street he remembered that he
had not said good-bye to Sonia, that he had left her in the middle of
the room in her green shawl, not daring to stir after he had shouted
at her, and he stopped short for a moment. At the same instant, another
thought dawned upon him, as though it had been lying in wait to strike
him then.
â€œWhy, with what object did I go to her just now? I told her--on
business; on what business? I had no sort of business! To tell her I was
_going_; but where was the need? Do I love her? No, no, I drove her away
just now like a dog. Did I want her crosses? Oh, how low Iâ€™ve sunk! No,
I wanted her tears, I wanted to see her terror, to see how her heart
ached! I had to have something to cling to, something to delay me, some
friendly face to see! And I dared to believe in myself, to dream of what

He walked along the canal bank, and he had not much further to go. But
on reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along it
went to the Hay Market.
He looked eagerly to right and left, gazed intently at every object and
could not fix his attention on anything; everything slipped away. â€œIn
another week, another month I shall be driven in a prison van over this
bridge, how shall I look at the canal then? I should like to remember
NA
letters then? Itâ€™s written here â€˜Campany,â€™ thatâ€™s a thing to remember,
that letter _a_, and to look at it again in a month--how shall I look
at it then? What shall I be feeling and thinking then?... How trivial
it all must be, what I am fretting about now! Of course it must all be
interesting... in its way... (Ha-ha-ha! What am I thinking about?) I am
becoming a baby, I am showing off to myself; why am I ashamed? Foo! how
people shove! that fat man--a German he must be--who pushed against
me, does he know whom he pushed? Thereâ€™s a peasant woman with a baby,
begging. Itâ€™s curious that she thinks me happier than she is. I might
give her something, for the incongruity of it. Hereâ€™s a five copeck
piece left in my pocket, where did I get it? Here, here... take it, my
NA
NA
He went into the Hay Market. It was distasteful, very distasteful to be
in a crowd, but he walked just where he saw most people. He would have
given anything in the world to be alone; but he knew himself that he
would not have remained alone for a moment. There was a man drunk and
disorderly in the crowd; he kept trying to dance and falling down. There
was a ring round him. Raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd,
stared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short
jerky laugh. A minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him,
though he still stared. He moved away at last, not remembering where he
was; but when he got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenly
came over him, overwhelming him body and mind.
He suddenly recalled Soniaâ€™s words, â€œGo to the cross-roads, bow down to
the people, kiss the earth, for you have sinned against it too, and say
NA
that. And the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especially
of the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively
clutched at the chance of this new unmixed, complete sensation. It came
over him like a fit; it was like a single spark kindled in his soul and
spreading fire through him. Everything in him softened at once and the
tears started into his eyes. He fell to the earth on the spot....
He knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down to the earth, and
kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture. He got up and bowed
down a second time.
NA
There was a roar of laughter.
â€œHeâ€™s going to Jerusalem, brothers, and saying good-bye to his children
and his country. Heâ€™s bowing down to all the world and kissing the great
NA
little drunk.
NA
NA
NA
These exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov, and the words, â€œI am

died away. He bore these remarks quietly, however, and, without looking
round, he turned down a street leading to the police office. He had a
glimpse of something on the way which did not surprise him; he had felt
that it must be so. The second time he bowed down in the Hay Market he
saw, standing fifty paces from him on the left, Sonia. She was hiding
from him behind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place. She had
followed him then on his painful way! Raskolnikov at that moment felt
and knew once for all that Sonia was with him for ever and would follow
him to the ends of the earth, wherever fate might take him. It wrung his
heart... but he was just reaching the fatal place.
He went into the yard fairly resolutely. He had to mount to the third

the fateful moment was still far off, as though he had plenty of time
left for consideration.
Again the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about on the spiral
stairs, again the open doors of the flats, again the same kitchens and
the same fumes and stench coming from them. Raskolnikov had not been
here since that day. His legs were numb and gave way under him, but
still they moved forward. He stopped for a moment to take breath, to

wondered, reflecting. â€œIf I must drink the cup what difference does it

going to him? Couldnâ€™t he go to someone else? To Nikodim Fomitch?
Couldnâ€™t he turn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitchâ€™s lodgings?
At least then it would be done privately.... No, no! To the â€œexplosive

Turning cold and hardly conscious, he opened the door of the office.
There were very few people in it this time--only a house porter and a
peasant. The doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his screen.

 passed through his mind. Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was
settling himself at a bureau to write. In a corner another clerk was
seating himself. Zametov was not there, nor, of course, Nikodim Fomitch.

â€œA-ah! Not a sound was heard, not a sight was seen, but I scent the
Russian... how does it go on in the fairy tale... Iâ€™ve forgotten! â€˜At

Raskolnikov shuddered. The Explosive Lieutenant stood before him. He

was obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifle
exhilarated. â€œIf itâ€™s on business you are rather early.[*] Itâ€™s only a

     [*] Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after
     sunset, and that the last time Raskolnikov visited the

NA
â€œOf course, Raskolnikov. You didnâ€™t imagine Iâ€™d forgotten? Donâ€™t think I
NA
NA
â€œYes, yes, of course, Rodion Romanovitch! I was just getting at it. I
made many inquiries about you. I assure you Iâ€™ve been genuinely grieved
since that... since I behaved like that... it was explained to me
afterwards that you were a literary man... and a learned one too... and
so to say the first steps... Mercy on us! What literary or scientific
man does not begin by some originality of conduct! My wife and I have
the greatest respect for literature, in my wife itâ€™s a genuine passion!
Literature and art! If only a man is a gentleman, all the rest can be
gained by talents, learning, good sense, genius. As for a hat--well,
what does a hat matter? I can buy a hat as easily as I can a bun; but
whatâ€™s under the hat, what the hat covers, I canâ€™t buy that! I was even
meaning to come and apologise to you, but thought maybe youâ€™d... But I
am forgetting to ask you, is there anything you want really? I hear your

NA
â€œIâ€™ve even had the honour and happiness of meeting your sister--a highly
cultivated and charming person. I confess I was sorry I got so hot with
you. There it is! But as for my looking suspiciously at your fainting
fit--that affair has been cleared up splendidly! Bigotry and fanaticism!
I understand your indignation. Perhaps you are changing your lodging on

â€œNo, I only looked in... I came to ask... I thought that I should find

â€œOh, yes! Of course, youâ€™ve made friends, I heard. Well, no, Zametov is
not here. Yes, weâ€™ve lost Zametov. Heâ€™s not been here since yesterday...
he quarrelled with everyone on leaving... in the rudest way. He is a
feather-headed youngster, thatâ€™s all; one might have expected something
from him, but there, you know what they are, our brilliant young men.
He wanted to go in for some examination, but itâ€™s only to talk and
boast about it, it will go no further than that. Of course itâ€™s a very
different matter with you or Mr. Razumihin there, your friend. Your
career is an intellectual one and you wonâ€™t be deterred by failure. For
you, one may say, all the attractions of life _nihil est_--you are an
ascetic, a monk, a hermit!... A book, a pen behind your ear, a learned
research--thatâ€™s where your spirit soars! I am the same way myself....
NA
NA
â€œOh, I have. There are a great many Nihilists about nowadays, you know,
and indeed it is not to be wondered at. What sort of days are they? I
ask you. But we thought... you are not a Nihilist of course? Answer me
NA
NA
â€œBelieve me, you can speak openly to me as you would to yourself!
Official duty is one thing but... you are thinking I meant to say
_friendship_ is quite another? No, youâ€™re wrong! Itâ€™s not friendship,
but the feeling of a man and a citizen, the feeling of humanity and of
love for the Almighty. I may be an official, but I am always bound
to feel myself a man and a citizen.... You were asking about Zametov.
Zametov will make a scandal in the French style in a house of bad
reputation, over a glass of champagne... thatâ€™s all your Zametov is good
for! While Iâ€™m perhaps, so to speak, burning with devotion and lofty
feelings, and besides I have rank, consequence, a post! I am married and
have children, I fulfil the duties of a man and a citizen, but who is
he, may I ask? I appeal to you as a man ennobled by education... Then
NA
Raskolnikov raised his eyebrows inquiringly. The words of Ilya
Petrovitch, who had obviously been dining, were for the most part a
stream of empty sounds for him. But some of them he understood. He
looked at him inquiringly, not knowing how it would end.
NA
continued. â€œMidwives is my name for them. I think it a very satisfactory
one, ha-ha! They go to the Academy, study anatomy. If I fall ill, am
NA
Petrovitch laughed, quite pleased with his own wit. â€œItâ€™s an immoderate
zeal for education, but once youâ€™re educated, thatâ€™s enough. Why abuse
it? Why insult honourable people, as that scoundrel Zametov does? Why
did he insult me, I ask you? Look at these suicides, too, how common
they are, you canâ€™t fancy! People spend their last halfpenny and kill
themselves, boys and girls and old people. Only this morning we heard
about a gentleman who had just come to town. Nil Pavlitch, I say, what

NA
listlessness.
Raskolnikov started.
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, thatâ€™s so. He had lost his wife, was a man of reckless habits and
all of a sudden shot himself, and in such a shocking way.... He left
in his notebook a few words: that he dies in full possession of his
faculties and that no one is to blame for his death. He had money, they
NA
NA
â€œBah-bah-bah! Then no doubt you can tell us something about him. You had

Raskolnikov felt as though something had fallen on him and was stifling
him.
NA
NA
â€œOh, not at all, as often as you like. Itâ€™s a pleasure to see you and I
NA
Ilya Petrovitch held out his hand.
NA
NA
NA
He went out; he reeled, he was overtaken with giddiness and did not know
what he was doing. He began going down the stairs, supporting himself
with his right hand against the wall. He fancied that a porter pushed
past him on his way upstairs to the police office, that a dog in
the lower storey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a
rolling-pin at it and shouted. He went down and out into the yard.
There, not far from the entrance, stood Sonia, pale and horror-stricken.
She looked wildly at him. He stood still before her. There was a look of
poignant agony, of despair, in her face. She clasped her hands. His lips
worked in an ugly, meaningless smile. He stood still a minute, grinned
and went back to the police office.
Ilya Petrovitch had sat down and was rummaging among some papers. Before
him stood the same peasant who had pushed by on the stairs.
NA
Raskolnikov, with white lips and staring eyes, came slowly nearer.
He walked right to the table, leaned his hand on it, tried to say
something, but could not; only incoherent sounds were audible.
NA
Raskolnikov dropped on to a chair, but he kept his eyes fixed on the
face of Ilya Petrovitch, which expressed unpleasant surprise. Both
looked at one another for a minute and waited. Water was brought.

Raskolnikov refused the water with his hand, and softly and brokenly,
but distinctly said:

Raskolnikov repeated his statement.
EPILOGUE
I
Siberia. On the banks of a broad solitary river stands a town, one of
the administrative centres of Russia; in the town there is a fortress,
in the fortress there is a prison. In the prison the second-class
convict Rodion Raskolnikov has been confined for nine months. Almost a
year and a half has passed since his crime.
There had been little difficulty about his trial. The criminal adhered
exactly, firmly, and clearly to his statement. He did not confuse nor
misrepresent the facts, nor soften them in his own interest, nor omit
the smallest detail. He explained every incident of the murder, the
secret of _the pledge_ (the piece of wood with a strip of metal) which
was found in the murdered womanâ€™s hand. He described minutely how he
had taken her keys, what they were like, as well as the chest and its
contents; he explained the mystery of Lizavetaâ€™s murder; described how
Koch and, after him, the student knocked, and repeated all they had said
to one another; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolay
and Dmitri shouting; how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards
gone home. He ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the
Voznesensky Prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found.
The whole thing, in fact, was perfectly clear. The lawyers and the
judges were very much struck, among other things, by the fact that he
had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, without making
use of them, and that, what was more, he did not now remember what the
trinkets were like, or even how many there were. The fact that he had
never opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed
incredible. There turned out to be in the purse three hundred and
seventeen roubles and sixty copecks. From being so long under the stone,
some of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the
damp. They were a long while trying to discover why the accused man
should tell a lie about this, when about everything else he had made
a truthful and straightforward confession. Finally some of the lawyers
more versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really
not looked into the purse, and so didnâ€™t know what was in it when he
hid it under the stone. But they immediately drew the deduction that
the crime could only have been committed through temporary mental
derangement, through homicidal mania, without object or the pursuit of
gain. This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary
insanity, so often applied in our days in criminal cases. Moreover
Raskolnikovâ€™s hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses, by
Dr. Zossimov, his former fellow students, his landlady and her servant.
All this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not
quite like an ordinary murderer and robber, but that there was another
element in the case.
To the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion, the
criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself. To the decisive question
as to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery, he
answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was
his miserable position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire to
provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand
roubles he had reckoned on finding. He had been led to the murder
through his shallow and cowardly nature, exasperated moreover by
privation and failure. To the question what led him to confess, he
answered that it was his heartfelt repentance. All this was almost
coarse....
The sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected,
perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself,
but had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt. All the strange
and peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration.
There could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition
of the criminal at the time. The fact that he had made no use of what he
had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse, partly to his
abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime. Incidentally the
murder of Lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a man
commits two murders and forgets that the door is open! Finally, the
confession, at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by
the false evidence given by Nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism,
and when, moreover, there were no proofs against the real criminal, no
suspicions even (Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word)--all this did
much to soften the sentence. Other circumstances, too, in the prisonerâ€™s
favour came out quite unexpectedly. Razumihin somehow discovered and
proved that while Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor
consumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting
him for six months, and when this student died, leaving a decrepit
old father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year,
Raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral
when he died. Raskolnikovâ€™s landlady bore witness, too, that when they
had lived in another house at Five Corners, Raskolnikov had rescued two
little children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so. This was
investigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses. These facts
made an impression in his favour.
And in the end the criminal was, in consideration of extenuating
circumstances, condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a
term of eight years only.
At the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikovâ€™s mother fell ill. Dounia
and Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the
trial. Razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from Petersburg, so
as to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time
to see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible. Pulcheria Alexandrovnaâ€™s
illness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partial
derangement of her intellect.
When Dounia returned from her last interview with her brother, she
had found her mother already ill, in feverish delirium. That evening
Razumihin and she agreed what answers they must make to her motherâ€™s
questions about Raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her
motherâ€™s benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of Russia
on a business commission, which would bring him in the end money and
reputation.
But they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna never
asked them anything on the subject, neither then nor thereafter. On the
contrary, she had her own version of her sonâ€™s sudden departure; she
told them with tears how he had come to say good-bye to her, hinting
that she alone knew many mysterious and important facts, and that Rodya
had many very powerful enemies, so that it was necessary for him to be
in hiding. As for his future career, she had no doubt that it would be
brilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed. She assured
Razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman, that his
article and brilliant literary talent proved it. This article she was
continually reading, she even read it aloud, almost took it to bed
with her, but scarcely asked where Rodya was, though the subject was
obviously avoided by the others, which might have been enough to awaken
her suspicions.
They began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexandrovnaâ€™s strange
silence on certain subjects. She did not, for instance, complain of
getting no letters from him, though in previous years she had only lived
on the hope of letters from her beloved Rodya. This was the cause of
great uneasiness to Dounia; the idea occurred to her that her mother
suspected that there was something terrible in her sonâ€™s fate and was
afraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still more awful. In any
case, Dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of
her faculties.
It happened once or twice, however, that Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave
such a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her
without mentioning where Rodya was, and on receiving unsatisfactory and
suspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent, and this mood
lasted for a long time. Dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive
her and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely
silent on certain points; but it became more and more evident that
the poor mother suspected something terrible. Dounia remembered her
brotherâ€™s telling her that her mother had overheard her talking in her
sleep on the night after her interview with SvidrigaÃ¯lov and before the
fatal day of the confession: had not she made out something from that?
Sometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be
succeeded by a period of hysterical animation, and the invalid would
begin to talk almost incessantly of her son, of her hopes of his
future.... Her fancies were sometimes very strange. They humoured her,
pretended to agree with her (she saw perhaps that they were pretending),
but she still went on talking.
Five months after Raskolnikovâ€™s confession, he was sentenced. Razumihin
and Sonia saw him in prison as often as it was possible. At last
the moment of separation came. Dounia swore to her brother that the
separation should not be for ever, Razumihin did the same. Razumihin, in
his youthful ardour, had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least
of a secure livelihood during the next three or four years, and saving
up a certain sum, to emigrate to Siberia, a country rich in every
natural resource and in need of workers, active men and capital. There
they would settle in the town where Rodya was and all together would
begin a new life. They all wept at parting.
Raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before. He asked a great
deal about his mother and was constantly anxious about her. He worried
so much about her that it alarmed Dounia. When he heard about his
motherâ€™s illness he became very gloomy. With Sonia he was particularly
reserved all the time. With the help of the money left to her by
SvidrigaÃ¯lov, Sonia had long ago made her preparations to follow the
party of convicts in which he was despatched to Siberia. Not a word
passed between Raskolnikov and her on the subject, but both knew it
would be so. At the final leave-taking he smiled strangely at his
sisterâ€™s and Razumihinâ€™s fervent anticipations of their happy future
together when he should come out of prison. He predicted that their
motherâ€™s illness would soon have a fatal ending. Sonia and he at last
set off.
Two months later Dounia was married to Razumihin. It was a quiet and
sorrowful wedding; Porfiry Petrovitch and Zossimov were invited however.
During all this period Razumihin wore an air of resolute determination.
Dounia put implicit faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed she
could not but believe in him. He displayed a rare strength of will.
Among other things he began attending university lectures again in order
to take his degree. They were continually making plans for the future;
both counted on settling in Siberia within five years at least. Till
then they rested their hopes on Sonia.
Pulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her blessing to Douniaâ€™s
marriage with Razumihin; but after the marriage she became even more
melancholy and anxious. To give her pleasure Razumihin told her how
Raskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father
and how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescuing two
little children from a fire. These two pieces of news excited Pulcheria
Alexandrovnaâ€™s disordered imagination almost to ecstasy. She was
continually talking about them, even entering into conversation with
strangers in the street, though Dounia always accompanied her. In public
conveyances and shops, wherever she could capture a listener, she would
begin the discourse about her son, his article, how he had helped the
student, how he had been burnt at the fire, and so on! Dounia did
not know how to restrain her. Apart from the danger of her morbid
excitement, there was the risk of someoneâ€™s recalling Raskolnikovâ€™s name
and speaking of the recent trial. Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out the
address of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted
on going to see her.
At last her restlessness reached an extreme point. She would sometimes
begin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious. One
morning she declared that by her reckoning Rodya ought soon to be home,
that she remembered when he said good-bye to her he said that they must
expect him back in nine months. She began to prepare for his coming,
began to do up her room for him, to clean the furniture, to wash and
put up new hangings and so on. Dounia was anxious, but said nothing and
helped her to arrange the room. After a fatiguing day spent in continual
fancies, in joyful day-dreams and tears, Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
taken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious.
It was brain fever. She died within a fortnight. In her delirium she
dropped words which showed that she knew a great deal more about her
sonâ€™s terrible fate than they had supposed.
For a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his motherâ€™s death, though
a regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached
Siberia. It was carried on by means of Sonia, who wrote every month
to the Razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity. At
first they found Soniaâ€™s letters dry and unsatisfactory, but later on
they came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better, for
from these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate
brotherâ€™s life. Soniaâ€™s letters were full of the most matter-of-fact
detail, the simplest and clearest description of all Raskolnikovâ€™s
surroundings as a convict. There was no word of her own hopes, no
conjecture as to the future, no description of her feelings. Instead of
any attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life, she gave the
simple facts--that is, his own words, an exact account of his health,
what he asked for at their interviews, what commission he gave her
and so on. All these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness. The
picture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness
and precision. There could be no mistake, because nothing was given but
facts.
But Dounia and her husband could get little comfort out of the news,
especially at first. Sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and not
ready to talk, that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave
him from their letters, that he sometimes asked after his mother and
that when, seeing that he had guessed the truth, she told him at last
of her death, she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly
affected by it, not externally at any rate. She told them that, although
he seemed so wrapped up in himself and, as it were, shut himself off
from everyone--he took a very direct and simple view of his new life;
that he understood his position, expected nothing better for the time,
had no ill-founded hopes (as is so common in his position) and scarcely
seemed surprised at anything in his surroundings, so unlike anything he
had known before. She wrote that his health was satisfactory; he did his
work without shirking or seeking to do more; he was almost indifferent
about food, but except on Sundays and holidays the food was so bad that
at last he had been glad to accept some money from her, Sonia, to have
his own tea every day. He begged her not to trouble about anything else,
declaring that all this fuss about him only annoyed him. Sonia wrote
further that in prison he shared the same room with the rest, that she
had not seen the inside of their barracks, but concluded that they were
crowded, miserable and unhealthy; that he slept on a plank bed with a
rug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement. But that
he lived so poorly and roughly, not from any plan or design, but simply
from inattention and indifference.
Sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits,
had almost been vexed with her indeed for coming, unwilling to talk and
rude to her. But that in the end these visits had become a habit and
almost a necessity for him, so that he was positively distressed when
she was ill for some days and could not visit him. She used to see him
on holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room, to which he was
brought for a few minutes to see her. On working days she would go to
see him at work either at the workshops or at the brick kilns, or at the
sheds on the banks of the Irtish.
About herself, Sonia wrote that she had succeeded in making some
acquaintances in the town, that she did sewing, and, as there
was scarcely a dressmaker in the town, she was looked upon as an
indispensable person in many houses. But she did not mention that the
authorities were, through her, interested in Raskolnikov; that his task
was lightened and so on.
At last the news came (Dounia had indeed noticed signs of alarm and
uneasiness in the preceding letters) that he held aloof from everyone,
that his fellow prisoners did not like him, that he kept silent for days
at a time and was becoming very pale. In the last letter Sonia wrote
that he had been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of
the hospital.
II
He was ill a long time. But it was not the horrors of prison life, not
the hard labour, the bad food, the shaven head, or the patched clothes
that crushed him. What did he care for all those trials and hardships!
he was even glad of the hard work. Physically exhausted, he could at
least reckon on a few hours of quiet sleep. And what was the food to
him--the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it? In the past as a
student he had often not had even that. His clothes were warm and suited
to his manner of life. He did not even feel the fetters. Was he ashamed
of his shaven head and parti-coloured coat? Before whom? Before Sonia?
Sonia was afraid of him, how could he be ashamed before her? And yet he
was ashamed even before Sonia, whom he tortured because of it with
his contemptuous rough manner. But it was not his shaven head and his
fetters he was ashamed of: his pride had been stung to the quick. It was
wounded pride that made him ill. Oh, how happy he would have been if he
could have blamed himself! He could have borne anything then, even
shame and disgrace. But he judged himself severely, and his exasperated
conscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past, except
a simple _blunder_ which might happen to anyone. He was ashamed just
because he, Raskolnikov, had so hopelessly, stupidly come to grief
through some decree of blind fate, and must humble himself and submit to
NA
Vague and objectless anxiety in the present, and in the future a
continual sacrifice leading to nothing--that was all that lay before
him. And what comfort was it to him that at the end of eight years he
would only be thirty-two and able to begin a new life! What had he to
live for? What had he to look forward to? Why should he strive? To live
in order to exist? Why, he had been ready a thousand times before to
give up existence for the sake of an idea, for a hope, even for a fancy.
Mere existence had always been too little for him; he had always wanted
more. Perhaps it was just because of the strength of his desires that he
had thought himself a man to whom more was permissible than to others.
And if only fate would have sent him repentance--burning repentance that
would have torn his heart and robbed him of sleep, that repentance, the
awful agony of which brings visions of hanging or drowning! Oh, he would
have been glad of it! Tears and agonies would at least have been life.
But he did not repent of his crime.
At least he might have found relief in raging at his stupidity, as he
had raged at the grotesque blunders that had brought him to prison.
But now in prison, _in freedom_, he thought over and criticised all his
actions again and by no means found them so blundering and so grotesque
as they had seemed at the fatal time.

was broken and blood was shed. Well, punish me for the letter of the

benefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of
inheriting it ought to have been punished at their first steps. But
those men succeeded and so _they were right_, and I didnâ€™t, and so I

It was only in that that he recognised his criminality, only in the fact
that he had been unsuccessful and had confessed it.
He suffered too from the question: why had he not killed himself? Why
had he stood looking at the river and preferred to confess? Was the
desire to live so strong and was it so hard to overcome it? Had not
SvidrigaÃ¯lov overcome it, although he was afraid of death?
In misery he asked himself this question, and could not understand that,
at the very time he had been standing looking into the river, he had
perhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and
his convictions. He didnâ€™t understand that that consciousness might be
the promise of a future crisis, of a new view of life and of his future
resurrection.
He preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which he
could not step over, again through weakness and meanness. He looked at
his fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life and
prized it. It seemed to him that they loved and valued life more in
prison than in freedom. What terrible agonies and privations some of
them, the tramps for instance, had endured! Could they care so much for
a ray of sunshine, for the primeval forest, the cold spring hidden away
in some unseen spot, which the tramp had marked three years before, and
longed to see again, as he might to see his sweetheart, dreaming of the
green grass round it and the bird singing in the bush? As he went on he
saw still more inexplicable examples.
In prison, of course, there was a great deal he did not see and did not
want to see; he lived as it were with downcast eyes. It was loathsome
and unbearable for him to look. But in the end there was much that
surprised him and he began, as it were involuntarily, to notice much
that he had not suspected before. What surprised him most of all was
the terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest. They
seemed to be a different species, and he looked at them and they at
him with distrust and hostility. He felt and knew the reasons of his
isolation, but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons
were so deep and strong. There were some Polish exiles, political
prisoners, among them. They simply looked down upon all the rest as
ignorant churls; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them like that.
He saw that these ignorant men were in many respects far wiser than the
Poles. There were some Russians who were just as contemptuous, a former
officer and two seminarists. Raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly.
He was disliked and avoided by everyone; they even began to hate him at
last--why, he could not tell. Men who had been far more guilty despised
and laughed at his crime.

The second week in Lent, his turn came to take the sacrament with his
gang. He went to church and prayed with the others. A quarrel broke out
one day, he did not know how. All fell on him at once in a fury.

NA
He had never talked to them about God nor his belief, but they wanted to
kill him as an infidel. He said nothing. One of the prisoners rushed at
him in a perfect frenzy. Raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently;
his eyebrows did not quiver, his face did not flinch. The guard
succeeded in intervening between him and his assailant, or there would
have been bloodshed.
There was another question he could not decide: why were they all so
fond of Sonia? She did not try to win their favour; she rarely met
them, sometimes only she came to see him at work for a moment. And yet
everybody knew her, they knew that she had come out to follow _him_,
knew how and where she lived. She never gave them money, did them no
particular services. Only once at Christmas she sent them all presents
of pies and rolls. But by degrees closer relations sprang up between
them and Sonia. She would write and post letters for them to their
relations. Relations of the prisoners who visited the town, at their
instructions, left with Sonia presents and money for them. Their wives
and sweethearts knew her and used to visit her. And when she visited
Raskolnikov at work, or met a party of the prisoners on the road, they
all took off their hats to her. â€œLittle mother Sofya Semyonovna, you

frail little creature. She would smile and bow to them and everyone was
delighted when she smiled. They even admired her gait and turned round
to watch her walking; they admired her too for being so little, and, in
fact, did not know what to admire her most for. They even came to her
for help in their illnesses.
He was in the hospital from the middle of Lent till after Easter. When
he was better, he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish
and delirious. He dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a
terrible new strange plague that had come to Europe from the depths of
Asia. All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen. Some new sorts
of microbes were attacking the bodies of men, but these microbes were
endowed with intelligence and will. Men attacked by them became at once
mad and furious. But never had men considered themselves so intellectual
and so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers, never
had they considered their decisions, their scientific conclusions, their
moral convictions so infallible. Whole villages, whole towns and peoples
went mad from the infection. All were excited and did not understand
one another. Each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretched
looking at the others, beat himself on the breast, wept, and wrung
his hands. They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to
consider evil and what good; they did not know whom to blame, whom
to justify. Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite. They
gathered together in armies against one another, but even on the march
the armies would begin attacking each other, the ranks would be broken
and the soldiers would fall on each other, stabbing and cutting, biting
and devouring each other. The alarm bell was ringing all day long in
the towns; men rushed together, but why they were summoned and who was
summoning them no one knew. The most ordinary trades were abandoned,
because everyone proposed his own ideas, his own improvements, and they
could not agree. The land too was abandoned. Men met in groups, agreed
on something, swore to keep together, but at once began on something
quite different from what they had proposed. They accused one another,
fought and killed each other. There were conflagrations and famine. All
men and all things were involved in destruction. The plague spread and
moved further and further. Only a few men could be saved in the whole
world. They were a pure chosen people, destined to found a new race and
a new life, to renew and purify the earth, but no one had seen these
men, no one had heard their words and their voices.
Raskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream haunted his memory so
miserably, the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long.
The second week after Easter had come. There were warm bright spring
days; in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel
paced were opened. Sonia had only been able to visit him twice during
his illness; each time she had to obtain permission, and it was
difficult. But she often used to come to the hospital yard, especially
in the evening, sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the
windows of the ward.
One evening, when he was almost well again, Raskolnikov fell asleep. On
waking up he chanced to go to the window, and at once saw Sonia in the
distance at the hospital gate. She seemed to be waiting for someone.
Something stabbed him to the heart at that minute. He shuddered and
moved away from the window. Next day Sonia did not come, nor the day
after; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily. At last he was
discharged. On reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that
Sofya Semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out.
He was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her; he soon learnt that
her illness was not dangerous. Hearing that he was anxious about her,
Sonia sent him a pencilled note, telling him that she was much better,
that she had a slight cold and that she would soon, very soon come and
see him at his work. His heart throbbed painfully as he read it.
Again it was a warm bright day. Early in the morning, at six oâ€™clock, he
went off to work on the river bank, where they used to pound alabaster
and where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed. There were only
three of them sent. One of the convicts went with the guard to the
fortress to fetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready and
laying it in the kiln. Raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river
bank, sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at the
wide deserted river. From the high bank a broad landscape opened before
him, the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank.
In the vast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like black
specks, the nomadsâ€™ tents. There there was freedom, there other men were
living, utterly unlike those here; there time itself seemed to stand
still, as though the age of Abraham and his flocks had not passed.
Raskolnikov sat gazing, his thoughts passed into day-dreams, into
contemplation; he thought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excited
and troubled him. Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she had come up
noiselessly and sat down at his side. It was still quite early; the
morning chill was still keen. She wore her poor old burnous and the
green shawl; her face still showed signs of illness, it was thinner and
paler. She gave him a joyful smile of welcome, but held out her hand
with her usual timidity. She was always timid of holding out her hand
to him and sometimes did not offer it at all, as though afraid he would
repel it. He always took her hand as though with repugnance, always
seemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout
her visit. Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply
grieved. But now their hands did not part. He stole a rapid glance
at her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking. They were
alone, no one had seen them. The guard had turned away for the time.
How it happened he did not know. But all at once something seemed to
seize him and fling him at her feet. He wept and threw his arms round
her knees. For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she
turned pale. She jumped up and looked at him trembling. But at the same
moment she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into her
eyes. She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and
that at last the moment had come....
They wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their eyes. They
were both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces were bright with the
dawn of a new future, of a full resurrection into a new life. They were
renewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the
heart of the other.
They resolved to wait and be patient. They had another seven years to
wait, and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before
them! But he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his
being, while she--she only lived in his life.
On the evening of the same day, when the barracks were locked,
Raskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of her. He had even fancied
that day that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at him
differently; he had even entered into talk with them and they answered
him in a friendly way. He remembered that now, and thought it was bound
to be so. Wasnâ€™t everything now bound to be changed?
He thought of her. He remembered how continually he had tormented her
and wounded her heart. He remembered her pale and thin little face.
But these recollections scarcely troubled him now; he knew with what
infinite love he would now repay all her sufferings. And what were all,
_all_ the agonies of the past! Everything, even his crime, his sentence
and imprisonment, seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an
external, strange fact with which he had no concern. But he could not
think for long together of anything that evening, and he could not have
analysed anything consciously; he was simply feeling. Life had stepped
into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself
out in his mind.
Under his pillow lay the New Testament. He took it up mechanically.
The book belonged to Sonia; it was the one from which she had read the
raising of Lazarus to him. At first he was afraid that she would worry
him about religion, would talk about the gospel and pester him with
books. But to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject
and had not even offered him the Testament. He had asked her for it
himself not long before his illness and she brought him the book without
a word. Till now he had not opened it.
He did not open it now, but one thought passed through his mind: â€œCan
her convictions not be mine now? Her feelings, her aspirations at
NA
She too had been greatly agitated that day, and at night she was taken
ill again. But she was so happy--and so unexpectedly happy--that she was
almost frightened of her happiness. Seven years, _only_ seven years! At
the beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both ready
to look on those seven years as though they were seven days. He did not
know that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he would
have to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great striving, great
suffering.
But that is the beginning of a new story--the story of the gradual
renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing
from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life.
That might be the subject of a new story, but our present story is
