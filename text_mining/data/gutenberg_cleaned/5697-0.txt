In the saloon bar of a public-house, situated only a few hundred yards
from the official frontier of Chinatown, two men sat at a small table
in a corner, engaged in earnest conversation. They afforded a sharp
contrast. One was a thick-set and rather ruffianly looking fellow, not
too cleanly in either person or clothing, and, amongst other evidences
that at one time he had known the prize ring, possessing a badly broken
nose. His companion was dressed with that spruceness which belongs to
the successful East End Jew; he was cleanly shaven, of slight build, and
alert in manner and address.
Having ordered and paid for two whiskies and sodas, the Jew, raising
his glass, nodded to his companion and took a drink. The glitter of
a magnificent diamond which he wore seemed to attract the otherâ€™s
attention almost hypnotically.

in his pocket.

NA
NA
Jim Poland--for such was the big manâ€™s name--growled and spat
reflectively into a spittoon.
NA
NA
Beneath his suave manner lay a threat, and, indeed, Freddy Cohen, known

personality. He had brought to his chosen profession of crook a
first-rate American training, together with all that mental agility and
cleverness which belong to his race, and was at once an object of envy
and admiration amongst the fraternity which keeps Scotland Yard busy.
Jim Poland, physically a more dangerous character, was not in the same
class with him; but he was not without brains of a sort, and Cohen,
although smiling agreeably, waited with some anxiety for his reply.

Cohen shrugged and raised his glass again.

The Jewâ€™s expression changed subtly, and beneath his drooping lids he
glanced aside at the speaker. Then:

The Jew made a facial gesture as if to dismiss the subject.

Cohen shifted uneasily, glancing about him in a furtive fashion.
NA

He finished his whisky at a draught, and, standing up, lurched heavily
across to the counter. He returned with two more glasses. Then,
reseating himself and bending forward again:

pie to me. Youâ€™re trying to get me figuring on Chinese death traps,
secret poisons, and all that junk. Boy, youâ€™re wasting your poetry.
Even if you did see the Chink with Lala, and I doubt it--Oh, donâ€™t
get excited, Iâ€™m speaking plain--thereâ€™s no connection that I can see

in a vise and bent forward so that his battered face was close to the
pale countenance of the Jew. â€œIâ€™ve been covering old Huang for months
and months. Now Iâ€™m going to tell you something. Since the death of that

NA
canâ€™t freeze me out of this claim with bogey stuff. Youâ€™re listed, my
lad, and you know it. Chief Inspector Kerry is your pet nightmare.
But if he walked in here right now I could ask him to have a drink. I
wouldnâ€™t but I could. Youâ€™ve got the wrong angle, Jim. Lala likes me
fine, and although she doesnâ€™t say much, what she does say is straight.

Jim Poland bent forward more urgently, again seizing Cohenâ€™s wrist, and:
NA
glancing cautiously about him. â€œHeâ€™s hellish clever and rotten with
money. A man like that wants handling. Iâ€™m not telling you what I know.
NA
The brow of Diamond Fred displayed beads of perspiration, and with
a blue silk handkerchief which he carried in his breast pocket he
delicately dried his forehead.

Jim Polandâ€™s brow lowered and he clenched his fists formidably. Then:

Freddy Cohen finished his glass of whisky.
NA
In this way, then, at about the hour of ten on a stuffy autumn night, in
the crowded bar of that Wapping public-house, these two made a
compact; and of its outcome and of the next appearance of Cohen, the
Jewish-American cracksman, within the ken of man, I shall now proceed to
tell.

THE END OF COHEN
NA
bowler hat farther forward over his brow and contemplated the ghastly
exhibit which lay upon the slab of the mortuary. Two other police
officers--one in uniform--were present, and they treated the celebrated
Chief Inspector with the deference which he had not only earned but had
always demanded from his subordinates.
Earmarked for important promotion, he was an interesting figure as
he stood there in the gloomy, ill-lighted place, his pose that of an
athlete about to perform a long jump, or perhaps, as it might have
appeared to some, that of a dancing-master about to demonstrate a new
step.
His close-cropped hair was brilliantly red, and so was his short, wiry,
aggressive moustache. He was ruddy of complexion, and he looked out
unblinkingly upon the world with a pair of steel-blue eyes. Neat he
was to spruceness, and while of no more than medium height he had the
shoulders of an acrobat.
The detective who stood beside him, by name John Durham, had one trait
in common with his celebrated superior. This was a quick keenness, a
sort of alert vitality, which showed in his eyes, and indeed in every
line of his thin, clean-shaven face. Kerry had picked him out as the
most promising junior in his department.
NA
NA
His diction was rapid and terse--so rapid as to create the impression
that he bit off the ends of the longer words. He turned his fierce blue
eyes upon the uniformed officer who stood at the end of the slab.
NA
out by the river police shortly after midnight, at the lower end of
Limehouse Reach. He was alive then--they heard his cry--but he died
NA
NA
â€œHe was past it, Chief Inspector. According to the report of the officer
in charge, he mumbled something which sounded like: â€˜It has bitten me,â€™
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, Chief Inspector. And in his opinion the man did not die from
NA
NA
â€œThatâ€™s the idea. There will be a further examination, of course. Either

Kerry stared down critically at the swollen face of the victim, and then
glanced sharply aside at Durham.

â€œTwo constables patrolling the Chinatown area arrested a man for
suspicious loitering. He turned out to be a well-known criminal--Jim
Poland, with a whole list of convictions against him. Theyâ€™re holding
him at Limehouse Station, and the theory is that he was operating

NA
NA
â€œYes, but heâ€™s been identified by one of the K Division men. He is an
American crook with a clean slate, so far as this side is concerned.

point between where he was found by the river police and the point at

Kerry snapped his teeth together audibly, and:
NA
NA
NA
NA
 snapped Kerry savagely.
NA
NA
followed by Detective Durham.
Although dawn was not far off, this was the darkest hour of the night,
so that even the sounds of dockland were muted and the riverside slept
as deeply as the great port of London ever sleeps. Vague murmurings
there were and distant clankings, with the hum of machinery which is
never still.
Few of Londonâ€™s millions were awake at that hour, yet Scotland Yard
was awake in the person of the fierce-eyed Chief Inspector and his
subordinate. Perhaps those who lightly criticize the Metropolitan Force
might have learned a new respect for the tireless vigilance which keeps
London clean and wholesome, had they witnessed this scene on the borders
of Limehouse, as Kerry, stepping into a waiting taxi-cab accompanied by
Durham, proceeded to Limehouse Police Station in that still hour when
the City slept.
The arrival of Kerry created something of a stir amongst the officials
on duty. His reputation in these days was at least as great as that of
the most garrulous Labour member.
The prisoner was in cells, but the Chief Inspector elected to interview
him in the office; and accordingly, while the officer in charge sat at
an extremely tidy writing-table, tapping the blotting-pad with a pencil,
and Detective John Durham stood beside him, Kerry paced up and down the
little room, deep in reflection, until the door opened and the prisoner
was brought in.
One swift glance the Chief Inspector gave at the battle-scarred face,
and recognized instantly that this was a badly frightened man. Crossing
to the table he took up a typewritten slip which lay there, and:
NA
NA
Jim Poland nodded sullenly.
â€œYou were arrested at the corner of Pekin Street about midnight. What

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Poland blinked his small eyes, cleared his throat, and looked down at
the floor uneasily. Then:
NA
NA
The shot went home. The man clenched his fists and looked about the room
from face to face.
NA
NA
NA
The man hesitated, then looked up, his eyes half closed and a cunning
expression upon his face.
NA
Kerry snapped his teeth together viciously.
NA
NA
NA
Kerry nodded to the constable at the doorway.
NA
Jim Poland being returned to his cell, Kerry, as the door closed behind
the prisoner and his guard, stared across at Durham where he stood
beside the table.
NA
NA
From his waistcoat pocket he took out a slip of chewing gum, unwrapped
it, and placed the mint-flavoured wafer between his large white teeth.
He bit upon it savagely, settled his hat upon his head, and, turning,
walked toward the door. In the doorway he paused.
NA
NA
Detective Durham looked surprised and not a little anxious.

III
THE SECRET TREASURE-HOUSE
Unlike its sister colony in New York, there are no show places in
Limehouse. The visitor sees nothing but mean streets and dark doorways.
The superficial inquirer comes away convinced that the romance of the
Asiatic district has no existence outside the imaginations of writers
of fiction. Yet here lies a secret quarter, as secret and as strange,
in its smaller way, as its parent in China which is called the Purple
Forbidden City.
On a morning when mist lay over the Thames reaches, softening the
harshness of the dock buildings and lending an air of mystery to the
vessels stealing out upon the tide, a man walked briskly along Limehouse
Causeway, looking about him inquiringly, as one unfamiliar with the
neighbourhood. Presently he seemed to recognize a turning to the right,
and he pursued this for a time, now walking more slowly.
A European woman, holding a half-caste baby in her arms, stood in an
open doorway, watching him uninterestedly. Otherwise, except for one
neatly dressed young Chinaman, who passed him about halfway along the
street, there was nothing which could have told the visitor that he
had crossed the borderline dividing West from East and was now in an
Oriental town.
A very narrow alleyway between two dingy houses proved to be the spot
for which he was looking; and, having stared about him for a while, he
entered this alleyway. At the farther end it was crossed T-fashion, by
another alley, the only object of interest being an iron post at the
crossing, and the scenery being made up entirely of hideous brick walls.
About halfway along on the left, set in one of these walls, were strong
wooden gates, apparently those of a warehouse. Beside them was a door
approached by two very dirty steps. There was a bell-push near the door,
but upon neither of these entrances was there any plate to indicate the
name of the proprietor of the establishment.
From his pocket-book the visitor extracted a card, consulted something
written upon it, and then pressed the bell.
It was very quiet in this dingy little court. No sound of the busy
thoroughfares penetrated here; and although the passage forming the
NA
discern the sounds which belong to a seaport.
Presently the door was opened by a Chinese boy who wore the ordinary
native working dress, and who regarded the man upon the step with
oblique, tired-looking eyes.
NA
The boy nodded.
NA
NA
The boy glanced at the card, which the visitor still held between finger
and thumb, and extended his hand silently. The card was surrendered. It
was that of an antique dealer of Dover Street, Piccadilly, and written
upon the back was the following: â€œMr. Hampden would like to do business
NA
The boy turned and passed along a dim and perfectly unfurnished passage
which the opening of the door had revealed, while Mr. Hampden stood upon
the step and lighted a cigarette.
In less than a minute the boy returned and beckoned to him to come in.
As he did so, and the door was closed, he almost stumbled, so dark was
the passage.
Presently, guided by the boy, he found himself in a very business-like
little office, where a girl sat at an American desk, looking up at him
inquiringly.
She was of a dark and arresting type. Without being pretty in the
European sense, there was something appealing in her fine, dark eyes,
and she possessed the inviting smile which is the heritage of Eastern
women. Her dress was not unlike that of any other business girl, except
that the neck of her blouse was cut very low, a fashion affected by many
Eurasians, and she wore a gaily coloured sash, and large and very costly
pearl ear-rings. As Mr. Hampden paused in the doorway:
NA
NA
She looked at him with a caressing glance from beneath half-lowered
lashes, but missed no detail of his appearance. She did not quite like
his moustache, and thought that he would have looked better cleanshaven.
Nevertheless, he was a well-set-up fellow, and her manner evidenced
approval.
NA
NA
The girl paused for a moment, and then:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
She pressed a bell, and, glancing up at the boy who had stood throughout
the interview at the visitorâ€™s elbow, addressed him rapidly in Chinese.
He nodded his head and led the way through a second doorway. Closing
this, he opened a third and ushered Mr. Hampden into a room which nearly
caused the latter to gasp with astonishment.
One who had blundered from Whitechapel into the Khan Khalil, who had
been transported upon a magic carpet from a tube station to the Taj
Mahal, or dropped suddenly upon Lebanon hills to find himself looking
down upon the pearly domes and jewelled gardens of Damascus, could not
well have been more surprised. This great treasure-house of old Huang
Chow was one of Chinatownâ€™s secrets--a secret shared only by those whose
commercial interests were identical with the interests of Huang Chow.
The place was artificially lighted by lamps which themselves were
beautiful objects of art, and which swung from the massive beams of
the ceiling. The floor of the warehouse, which was partly of stone, was
covered with thick matting, and spread upon it were rugs and carpets
of Karadagh, Kermanshah, Sultan-abad, and Khorassan, with lesser-known
loomings of almost equal beauty. Skins of rare beasts overlay the
divans. Furniture of ivory, of ebony and lemonwood, preciously inlaid,
gave to the place an air of cunning confusion. There were tall cabinets,
there were caskets and chests of exquisite lacquer and enamel, loot
of an emperorâ€™s palace; robes heavy with gold; slippers studded with
jewels; strange carven ivories; glittering weapons; pots, jars, and
bowls, as delicate and as fragile as the petals of a lily.
Last, but not least, sitting cross-legged upon a low couch, was old
Huang Chow, smoking a great curved pipe, and peering half blindly across
the place through large horn-rimmed spectacles. This couch was set
immediately beside a wide ascending staircase, richly carpeted, and
on the other side of the staircase, in a corresponding recess, upon a
gilded trestle carved to represent the four claws of a dragon, rested
perhaps the strangest exhibit of that strange collection--a Chinese
coffin of exquisite workmanship.
The boy retired, and Mr. Hampden found himself alone with Huang Chow. No
word had been exchanged between master and servant, but:

IV
PERSONAL REPORT OF DETECTIVE JOHN DURHAM TO CHIEF INSPECTOR KERRY,
OFFICER IN CHARGE OF LIMEHOUSE INQUIRY
Dear Chief Inspector,--Following your instructions I returned and
interviewed the prisoner Poland in his cell. I took the line which
you had suggested, pointing out to him that he had nothing to gain and
everything to lose by keeping silent.
NA
Otherwise, youâ€™ll be up before the magistrate, and on your record alone
NA
He was very truculent, but I got him in a good humour at last, and he
admitted that he had been cooperating with the dead man, Cohen, in an
attempt to burgle the house of Huang Chow. His reluctance to go into
details seemed to be due rather to fear of Huang Chow than to fear of
the law, and I presently gathered that he regarded Huang as responsible
for the death not only of Cohen, but also of the Chinaman who was
hauled out of the river about three weeks ago, as you well remember. The
post-mortem showed that he had died of some kind of poisoning, and when
we saw Cohen in the mortuary, his swollen appearance struck me as being
very similar to that of the Chinaman. (See my report dated 31st ultimo.)
He finally agreed to talk if I would promise that he should not be
charged and that his name should never be mentioned to anyone in
connection with what he might tell me. I promised him that outside the
ordinary official routine I would respect his request, and he told me
some very curious things, which no doubt have a bearing on the case.
For instance, he had discovered--I donâ€™t know in what way--that the dead
Chinaman, whose name was Pi Lung, had been in negotiation with Huang
Chow for some sort of job in his warehouse. Poland had seen the man
talking to Huangâ€™s daughter, at the end of the alley which leads to the
place. He seemed to attach extraordinary importance to this fact. At
last:
NA
Limehouse; I can swear to it. He was a gent of his hands; I reckon
theyâ€™ve got â€˜em in China as well as here. He went out for the old boyâ€™s
NA
NA
â€œMy meaningâ€™s this: Old Huang Chow is the biggest dealer in stolen and
smuggled valuables from overseas weâ€™ve got in London. Heâ€™s something
else as well; heâ€™s a big swell in China. But hereâ€™s the point. Heâ€™s
got business with buyers all over London, and they have to pay cash--no
checks. He doesnâ€™t bank it: Iâ€™ve proved that. Heâ€™s got it in gold, or
diamonds, or something, being wise to present conditions, hidden there
in the house. Pi Lung was after his hoard. He didnâ€™t get it. Cohen and
NA
I agreed that it looked very suspicious, and presently:
NA
he didnâ€™t know--a short cut into the warehouse. Heâ€™s been playing
pretty-like with Lala, old Huangâ€™s daughter, and itâ€™s my belief that
he knew where the store was hidden; but he never told me. We knew there
were special men on duty, and weâ€™d arranged that I was to give a signal
when the patrol had passed. Cohen all the time had planned to double on
me. While I was watching down on the Causeway end he climbed up and got
in through the skylight Iâ€™d shown him. When I got there he was missing,
NA
Then Poland clutched me, and his fright was very real.
â€œI heard a shriek like nothing I ever heard in my life. I saw a light
shine through the trap, and then I heard a sort of moaning. Last, I
heard a bang, and the light went out. I staggered down the passage half
NA
This evidence I thought was conclusive, and in accordance with your
instructions I proceeded to Mr. Isaacs in Dover Street. He didnâ€™t seem
too pleased at my suggestion, but when I pointed out to him that one
good turn deserved another, he agreed to give me an introduction to
Huang Chow.
I adopted a very simple disguise, just altering my complexion and
sticking on a moustache with spirit gum, hair by hair, and trimming it
down military fashion. Everything ran smoothly, and I seemed to make a
fairly favourable impression upon Lala Huang, the Chinamanâ€™s daughter,
who evidently interviews prospective customers before they are admitted
to the warehouse.
She is a Eurasian and extremely good looking. But when I found myself
in the room where old Huang keeps his treasures, I really thought I was
dreaming. Itâ€™s a collection that must be worth thousands. He showed me
snuff-bottles, cut out of gems, and with a little opening no bigger than
the hole in a pipe-stem, but with wonderful paintings done inside the
bottles. Heâ€™d got a model of a pagoda made out of human teeth, and a big
golden rug woven from the hair of Circassian slave girls. Excuse this,
Chief Inspector; I know it is what you call the romantic stuff; but I
think it would have impressed you if you had seen it.
Anyway, I bought a little enamelled box, in accordance with Mr. Isaacsâ€™s
instructions, although whether I succeeded in convincing Huang Chow that
I knew anything about the matter is more than doubtful. He got up from
a sort of throne he sits on, and led the way up a broad staircase to a
private room above.
NA
He speaks quite faultless English. He walked up three steps to a sort of
raised writing-table in this upstairs room, and I counted out the
money to him. When he sat at the table he faced toward the room, and I
couldnâ€™t help thinking that, in his horn-rimmed spectacles, he looked
like some old magistrate. He explained that he would pack the purchase
for me, but that I must personally take it away. And:
NA
NA
I said I quite understood. He bowed me out very politely, and presently
I found myself back in the office with Lala Huang.
She seemed quite disposed to talk, and I chatted with her while the box
was being packed for me to take away. I knew I must make good use of my
time, but you have never given me a job I liked less. I mean, there
is something very appealing about her, and I hated to think that I was
playing a double game. However, without actually agreeing to see me
NA
wanted to. Therefore, I am going to look out for her this evening, and
probably take her to a picture palace, or somewhere where we can have a
quiet talk. She seems to be fancy free, and for some reason I feel sorry
for the girl. I donâ€™t altogether like the job, but I hope to justify
your faith in me, Chief.
I will prepare my official report this evening when I return.
Yours obediently,--JOHN DURHAM.

Dusk had dropped its merciful curtain over Limehouse, and as the two
paced slowly along West India Dock Road it seemed to the detective that
a sort of glamour had crept into the scene.
He was a clever man within his limitations, and cultured up to a point;
but he was not philosopher enough to know that he viewed the purlieus
of Limehouse through a haze of Oriental mystery conjured up by the
conversation of his companion. Temple bells there were in the clangour
of the road cars. The smoke-stacks had a semblance of pagodas. Burma she
had conjured up before him, and China, and the soft islands where she
had first seen the light. For as well as a streak of European, there
was Kanaka blood in Lala, which lent her an appeal quite new to Durham,
insidious and therefore dangerous.

Durham did some rapid thinking, then:

NA

Lala Huang was silent for some time while they paced on through the
dusk. Then:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
They were come now to the narrow street communicating with the courtway
in which the great treasure-house of Huang Chow was situated, and Lala
stopped at the corner.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The girl glanced up at him doubtfully, and his distaste for the task set
him by his superior increased with the passing of every moment. He was
a man of some imagination, a great reader, and ambitious professionally.
He appreciated the fact that Chief Inspector Kerry looked for great
things from him, but for this type of work he had little inclination.
There was too much chivalry in his make-up to enable him to play upon a
womanâ€™s sentiments, even in the interests of justice. By whatever means
the man Cohen had met his death, and whether or no the Chinaman Pi Lung
had died by the same hand, Lala Huang was innocent of any complicity in
these matters, he was perfectly well assured.
Doubts were to come later when he was away from her, when he had had
leisure to consider that she might regard him in the light of a third
potential rifler of her fatherâ€™s treasure-house. But at the moment,
looking down into her dark eyes, he reproached himself and wondered
where his true duty lay.
NA

He caught the gleam of her eyes as she looked up at him out of the
shadow.

But when presently Detective Durham found himself walking back along
West India Dock Road, his mindâ€™s eye was set upon the slinking figure of
a Chinaman carrying a birdcage.
VI
A HINT OF INCENSE
One Chinaman more or less does not make any very great difference to
the authorities responsible for maintaining law and order in Limehouse.
Asiatic settlers are at liberty to follow their national propensities,
and to knife one another within reason. This is wisdom. Such recreations
are allowed, if not encouraged, by all wise rulers of Eastern peoples.
NA
of old Thames, but â€œFound in the river, death having been due to the
NA
Chinaman is calculated to stimulate the jaded official mind.
New Scotland Yard had given Durham a roving commission, and had been
justified in the fact that the second victim, and this time not a
Chinaman, had been found under almost identical conditions. The link
with the establishment of Huang Chow was incomplete, and Durham fully
recognized that it was up to him to make it sound and incontestable.
Jim Poland was not the only man in the East End who knew that the dead
Chinaman had been in negotiation with Huang Chow. Kerry knew it, and had
passed the information on to Durham.
Some mystery surrounded the life of the old dealer, who was said to be
a mandarin of high rank, but his exact association with the deaths first
of the Chinaman Pi Lung, and second of Cohen, remained to be proved.
Certain critics have declared the Metropolitan detective service to be
obsolete and inefficient. Kerry, as a potential superintendent, resented
these criticisms, and in his protege Durham, perceived a member of the
new generation who was likely in time to produce results calculated to
remove this stigma.
Durham recognized that a greater responsibility rested upon his
shoulders than the actual importance of the case might have indicated;
and now, proceeding warily along the deserted streets, he found his
brain to be extraordinarily active and his imagination very much alive.
There is a night life in Limehouse, as he had learned, but it is a mole
life, a subterranean life, of which no sign appears above ground after a
certain hour. Nevertheless, as he entered the area which harbours those
strange, hidden resorts the rumour of which has served to create the
glamour of Chinatown, he found himself to be thinking of the great
influence said to be wielded by Huang Chow, and wondering if unseen
spies watched his movements.
Lala was Oriental, and now, alone in the night, distrust leapt into
being within him. He had been attracted by her and had pitied her.
He told himself now that this was because of her dark beauty and the
essentially feminine appeal which she made. She was perhaps a vampire
of the most dangerous sort, one who lured men to strange deaths for some
sinister object beyond reach of a Western imagination.
He found himself doubting the success of those tactics upon which,
earlier in the day, he had congratulated himself. Perhaps beneath the
guise of Hampden, who bought antique furniture on commission, those
cunning old eyes beneath the horn-rimmed spectacles had perceived the
detective hidden, or at least had marked subterfuge.
While he could not count Lala a conquest--for he had not even
attempted to make love to her--the ease with which he had developed the
acquaintance now, afforded matter for suspicion.
At the entrance to the court communicating with the establishment of
Huang Chow he paused, looking cautiously about him. The men on the
Limehouse beats had been warned of the investigation afoot tonight, and
there was a plain-clothes man on point duty at no great distance away,
although carefully hidden, so that Durham had quite failed to detect his
presence.
Durham wore rough clothes and rubber-soled shoes; and now, as he entered
the court, he was thinking of the official report of the police sergeant
who, not so many hours before, had paid a visit to the house of Huang
Chow in order to question him respecting his knowledge of the dead man
Cohen, and to learn when last he had seen him.
Old Huang, who had received his caller in the large room upstairs, the
room which boasted the presence of the writing-dais, had exhibited no
trace of confusion, assuring the sergeant that he had not seen the
man Cohen for several days. Cohen had come to him with an American
introduction, which he, Huang, believed to be forged, and had wanted him
to undertake a shady agency, respecting the details of which he remained
peculiarly reticent. In short, nothing had been gained by this official
interrogation, and Huang blandly denied any knowledge of an attempted
burglary of his establishment.

NA
Durham, mentally reviewing the words of the report, reconstructed the
scene in his mind; and now, having come to the end of the lane where
the iron post rested, he stood staring up at a place in the ancient wall
where several bricks had decayed, and where it was possible, according
to the statement of the man Poland, to climb up on to a piece of sloping
roof, and thence gain the skylight through which Cohen had obtained
admittance on the night of his death.
He made sure that his automatic pistol was in his pocket, questioned the
dull sounds of the riverside for a moment, looking about him anxiously,
and then, using the leaning post as a stepping-stone, he succeeded in
wedging his foot into a crevice in the wall. By the exercise of some
agility he scrambled up to the top, and presently found himself lying
upon a sloping roof.
The skylight remained well out of reach, but his rubber-soled shoes
enabled him to creep up the slates until he could grasp the framework
with his hands. Presently he found himself perched upon the trap which,
if his information could be relied upon, possessed no fastener, or
one so faulty that the trap could be raised by means of a brad-awl.
He carried one in his pocket, and, screwing it into the framework, he
lifted it cautiously, making very little noise.
The trap opened, and up to his nostrils there stole a queer, indefinable
odour, partly that which belongs to old Oriental furniture and stuffs,
but having mingled with it a hint of incense and of something else not
so easily named. He recognized the smell of that strange store-room,
which, as Mr. Hampden, he had recently visited.
For one moment he thought he could detect the distant note of a bell.
But, listening, he heard nothing, and was reassured.
He rested the trap back against the frame, and shone the ray of an
electric torch down into the darkness beneath him. The light fell upon
the top of a low carven table, dragon-legged and gilded. Upon it rested
the model pagoda constructed of human teeth, and there was something in
this discovery which made Durham feel inclined to shudder. However, the
impulse was only a passing one.
He measured the distance with his eye. The little table stood beside a
deep divan, and he saw that with care it would be possible to drop upon
this divan without making much noise. He calculated its exact position
before replacing the torch in his pocket, and then, resting back against
one side of the frame, he clutched the other with his hands. He wriggled
gradually down until further purchase became impossible. He then let
himself drop, and swung for a moment by his hands before releasing his
hold.
He fell, as he had calculated, upon the divan. It creaked ominously.
Catching his foot in the cushions, he stumbled and lay forward for a
moment upon his face, listening intently.
The room was very hot but nothing stirred.
VII
THE SCUFFLING SOUND
Detective Durham, as he lay there inhaling the peculiar perfume of the
place, recognized that he had put himself outside the pale of official
protection, and was become technically a burglar.
He wondered if Chief Inspector Kerry would have approved; but he had
outlined this plan of investigation for himself, and knew well that,
if it were crowned by success, the end would be regarded as having
justified the means. On the other hand, in the event of detention he
must personally bear the consequences of such irregular behaviour. He
knew well, however, that his celebrated superior had achieved promotion
by methods at least as irregular; and he knew that if he could but
obtain evidence to account for the death of the man Cohen, and of the
Chinaman Pi Lung, who had preceded him by the same mysterious path, the
way of his obtaining it would not be too closely questioned.
He was an ambitious man, and consequently one who took big chances.
Nothing disturbed the silence; he sat upon the divan and again pressed
the button of his torch, shining it all about the low-beamed apartment
and peering curiously into the weird shadows of the place. He calculated
he was now in the position which Cohen had occupied during the last
moments of his life, and a sense of the uncanny touched him coldly.
As he thought of the unnatural screams spoken of by Poland, some strange
instinct prompted him to curl up his feet upon the divan again, as
though a secret menace crawled upon the floor amid its many rugs and
carpets.
He must now endeavour to reconstruct the plan upon which the American
cracksman had operated. Poland had a persistent belief that Cohen had
known where the fabled hoard of Huang Chow was concealed.
Durham began a deliberate inspection of the place. He thought it
unlikely that a wily old Chinaman, assuming that he possessed hidden
wealth, would keep it in so accessible a spot as this. It was far more
probable that he had a fireproof safe in the room upstairs, perhaps
built into the wall. Yet, according to Polandâ€™s account, it was in this
room and not in any other that death came to Diamond Fred.
The wall-hangings first engaged Durhamâ€™s attention. He moved them aside
systematically, one after another, seeking for any hiding-place, but
failing to find one. The door communicating with the outer office he
found to be locked, but he did not believe for a moment that the office
would be worthy of inspection.
There were cases containing jewelled weapons and cups and goblets inlaid
with precious stones, but none of these seemed to have been tampered
with, and all were locked, as was the big cabinet filled with snuff
bottles.
Many of the larger pieces about the place contained drawers and
cupboards, and these he systematically opened one after another, without
making any discovery of note. Some of the cupboards contained broken
pieces of crockery, and more or less damaged curios of one kind and
another, but none of them gave him the clue for which he was seeking.
He examined the couch upon which Huang Chow had been seated when first
he had met him, but although he searched it scientifically he was
rewarded by no discovery.
A very fusty and unpleasant smell was more noticeable at this point than
elsewhere in the room, and he found himself staring speculatively up
the wide, carpeted stairs. Next he turned his attention to the lacquered
coffin which occupied the corresponding recess to that filled by the
couch. It was an extraordinarily ornate piece of lacquer work and
probably of great value.
The lid appeared to be screwed on, and Durham stood staring at the
thing, half revolted and half fascinated. He failed to discover any
means of opening it, however, and when he tried to move it bodily found
it very heavy. He came to the conclusion that all the portable valuables
were contained in locked cases or cabinets, and out of this discovery
grew an idea.
The case containing the snuff bottles stood too close to the wall to
enable him to test his new theory, but a square case near the office
door, in which were five of six small but almost priceless pieces of
porcelain, afforded the very evidence for which he was looking.
Thin electric flex descended from somewhere inside the case down one
of the legs of the pedestal, and through a neatly drilled hole in the
floor, evidently placed there to accommodate it.
NA
The opening of this case, and doubtless of any of the others, would
set alarm bells ringing. This was not an unimportant discovery, but it
brought him very little nearer to a solution of the chief problem which
engaged his mind. Assuming that Cohen had opened one of the cases and
had alarmed old Huang Chow, what steps had the latter taken to deal with
the intruder which had resulted in so ghastly a death? And how had he
disposed of the body?
As Durham stood there musing and looking down through the plate-glass at
the delicate porcelain beneath, a faint sound intruded itself upon the
stillness. It gave him another idea. Part of the floor was stone-paved,
but part was wood.
Upon a portion of the latter, where no carpet rested, Durham dropped
flat, pressing his ear to the floor.
A faint swishing and trickling sound was perceptible from some place
beneath.
NA
Remembering that the premises almost overhung the Thames, he divined
that the cellars were flooded at high tide, or that there was some kind
of drain or cutting running underneath the house.
He stood up again, listening intently for any sound within the building.
He thought he had detected something, and now, as he stood there alert,
he heard it again--a faint scuffling, which might have been occasioned
by rats or even mice, but which, in some subtle and very unpleasant way,
did not suggest the movements of these familiar rodents.
Even as he perceived it, it ceased, leaving him wondering, and
uncomfortably conscious of a sudden dread of his surroundings. He
wondered in what part of this mysterious house Lala resided, and
recognizing that his departure must leave traces, he determined to
prosecute his inquiries as far as possible, since another opportunity
might not arise.
He was baffled but still hopeful. Something there was in the smell of
the place which threatened to unnerve him; or perhaps in its silence,
which remained quite unbroken save when, by acute listening, one
detected the dripping of water.
That unexplained scuffling sound, too, which he had failed to trace
or identify, lingered in his memory insistently, and for some reason
contained the elements of fear.
He crossed the room and began softly to mount the stair. It creaked only
slightly, and the door at the top proved to be ajar. He peeped in, to
find the place empty. It was a typical Chinese apartment, containing
very little furniture, the raised desk being the most noticeable item,
except for a small shrine which faced it on the other side of the room.
He mounted the steps to the desk and inspected a number of loose papers
which lay upon it. Without exception they were written in Chinese.
A sort of large, dull white blotting-pad lay upon the table, but its
surface was smooth and glossy.
Over it was suspended what looked like a lampshade, but on inspection it
proved to contain no lamp, but to communicate, by a sort of funnel, with
the ceiling above.
At this contrivance Durham stared long and curiously, but without coming
to any conclusion respecting its purpose. He might have investigated
further, but he became aware of a dull and regular sound in the room
behind him.
He turned in a flash, staring in the direction of two curtains draped
before what he supposed to be a door.
On tiptoe he crossed and gently drew the curtains aside.
He looked into a small, cell-like room, lighted by one window, where
upon a low bed Huang Chow lay sleeping peacefully!
Durham almost held his breath; then, withdrawing as quietly as he had
approached, he descended the stair. At the foot his attention was again
arrested by the faint scuffling sound. It ceased as suddenly as it
had begun, leaving him wondering and conscious anew of a chill of
apprehension.
He had already made his plans for departure, but knew that they must
leave evidence, when discovered, of his visit.
A large and solid table stood near the divan, and he moved this
immediately under the trap. Upon it he laid a leopard-skin to deaden
any noise he might make, and then upon the leopard-skin he set a massive
chair: he replaced his torch in his pocket and drew himself up on to the
roof again. Reclosing the trap by means of the awl which he had screwed
into it, he removed the awl and placed it in his pocket.
Then, sliding gently down the sloping roof, he dropped back into the
deserted court.

the roots of his hair.
They were seated in a teashop patronized by the workers of the district;
and as Durham, his elbows resting on the marble-topped table, looked
into the dark eyes of his companion, he told himself again that whatever
might be the secrets of old Huang Chow, his daughter did not share them.
The Chinaman had made no report to the authorities, although the piled
up furniture beneath the skylight must have afforded conclusive evidence
that a burglarious entry had been made into the premises.

Again he questioned the dark eyes and again was baffled. He felt
tempted, and not for the first time, to throw up the case. After all, it
rested upon very slender data--the mysterious death of a Chinaman
whose history was unknown and the story of a crook whose word was worth
nothing.
Finally he asked himself, as he had asked himself before, what did it
matter? If old Huang Chow had disposed of these people in some strange
manner, they had sought to rob him. The morality of the case was
complicated and obscure, and more and more he was falling under the
spell of Lalaâ€™s dark eyes.
But always it was his professional pride which came to the rescue.
Murder had been done, whether justifiably or otherwise, and to him had
been entrusted the discovery of the murderer. It seemed that failure
was to be his lot, for if Lala knew anything she was a most consummate
actress, and if she did not, his last hope of information was gone.
He would have liked nothing better than to be rid of the affair,
provided he could throw up the case with a clear conscience. But when
presently he parted from the attractive Eurasian, and watched her slim
figure as, turning, she waved her hand and disappeared round a corner,
he knew that rest was not for him.
He had discovered the emporium of a Shadwell live-stock dealer with whom
Ah Fu had a standing order for newly fledged birds of all descriptions.
Purchases apparently were always made after dusk, and Ah Fu with his
birdcage was due that evening.
A scheme having suggested itself to Durham, he now proceeded to put it
into execution, so that when dusk came, and Ah Fu, carrying an empty
birdcage, set out from the house of Huang Chow, a very dirty-looking
loafer passed the corner of the street at about the time that the
Chinaman came slinking out.
Durham had mentally calculated that Ah Fu would be gone about half an
hour upon his mysterious errand, but the Chinaman travelled faster than
he had calculated.
Just as he was about to climb up once more on to the sloping roof,
he heard the pattering footsteps returning to the courtyard, although
rather less than twenty minutes had elapsed since the man had set out.
Durham darted round the corner and waited until he heard the door
closed; then, returning, he scrambled up on to the roof, creeping
forward until he was lying looking down through the skylight into the
darkened room below.
For ten minutes or more he waited, until he began to feel cramped and
uncomfortable. Then that happened which he had hoped and anticipated
would happen. The place beneath became illuminated, not fully, by means
of the hanging lamps, but dimly so that distorted shadows were cast
about the floor. Someone had entered carrying a lantern.
Durhamâ€™s view-point limited his area of vision, but presently, as the
light came nearer and nearer, he discerned Ah Fu, carrying a lantern
in one hand and a birdcage in the other. He could hear nothing, for the
trap fitted well and the glass was thick. Moreover, it was very dirty.
He was afraid, however, to attempt to clean a space.
Ah Fu apparently had set the lantern upon a table, and into the radius
of its light there presently moved a stooping figure. Durham recognized
Huang Chow, and felt his heart beats increasing in rapidity.
Clutching the framework of the trap with his hands, he moved his head
cautiously, so that presently he was enabled to see the two Chinamen.
They were standing beside the lacquered coffin upon its dragon-legged
pedestal. Durham stifled an exclamation.
One end of the ornate sarcophagus had been opened in some way!
Now, to the watcherâ€™s unbounded astonishment, Ah Fu placed the birdcage
in the opening, and apparently reclosed the trap in the end of the
coffin. He made other manipulations with his bony yellow fingers, which
Durham failed to comprehend. Finally the birdcage was withdrawn again,
and as it was passed before the light of the lantern he saw that it was
empty, whereas previously it had contained a number of tiny birds all
huddled up together!
The light gleamed upon the spectacles of Huang Chow. Watching him,
Durham saw him take out from a hidden drawer in the pedestal a long,
slender key, insert it in a lock concealed by the ornate carving,
and then slightly raise the lid which had so recently defied his own
efforts.
He raised it only a few inches, and then, taking up the lantern, peered
into the interior of the coffin, at the same time waving his hand
in dismissal to Ah Fu. For a while he stood there, peering into the
interior, and then, lowering the lid again, he relocked this gruesome
receptacle and, lantern in hand, began to mount the stair.
Durham inhaled deeply. He realized that during the last few seconds he
had been holding his breath. Now, as he began to creep back down the
slope, he discovered that his hands were shaking.
He dropped down into the court again, and for several minutes leaned
against the wall, endeavouring to reason out an explanation of what he
had seen, and in a measure to regain his composure.
There was a horror underlying it all which he was half afraid to face.
But the real clue to the mystery still eluded him.
Whether what he had witnessed were some kind of obscene ceremony,
or whether an explanation more vile must be sought, he remained
undetermined. He must repeat his exploit, if possible, and once more
gain access to the room which contained the lacquer coffin.
But the adventure was very distasteful. He recollected the smell of the
place, and the memory brought with it a sense of nausea. He thought of
Lala Huang, and his ideas became grotesque and chaotic. Yet the solution
of the mystery lay at last within his grasp, and to the zest of the
investigator everything else became subjugated.
He walked slowly away, silent in his rubber-soled shoes.
IX
THE PICTURE ON THE PAD
Lala Huang lay listening to the vague sounds which disturbed the silence
of the night. Presently her thoughts made her sigh wearily. During the
lifetime of her mother, who had died while Lala was yet a little girl,
life had been different and so much brighter.
She imagined that in the mingled sounds of dock and river which came to
her she could hear the roar of surf upon a golden beach. The stuffy
air of Limehouse took on the hot fragrance of a tropic island, and she
sighed again, but this time rapturously, for in spirit she was a child
once more, lulled by the voice of the great Pacific.
Young as she was, the death of her mother had been a blow from which it
had taken her several years to recover. Then had commenced those
long travels with her father, from port to port, from ocean to ocean,
sometimes settling awhile, but ever moving onward, onward.
He had had her educated after a fashion, and his love for her she did
not doubt. But her motherâ€™s blood spoke more strongly than that part of
her which was Chinese, and there was softness and a delicious languor in
her nature which her father did not seem to understand, and of which he
did not appear to approve.
She knew that he was wealthy. She knew that his ways were not straight
ways, although that part of his business to which he had admitted her as
an assistant, and an able one, was legitimate enough, or so it seemed.
Consignments of goods arrived at strange hours of the night at
the establishment in Limehouse, and from this side of her fatherâ€™s
transactions she was barred. The big double doors opening on the little
courtyard would be opened by Ah Fu, and packing cases of varying sizes
be taken in. Sometimes the sounds of these activities would reach her in
her room in a distant part of the house; but only in the morning would
she recognize their significance, when in the warehouse she would
discover that some new and choice pieces had arrived.
She wondered with what object her father accumulated wealth, and hoped,
against the promptings of her common sense, that he designed to return
East, there to seek a retirement amidst the familiar and the beautiful
things of the Orient which belonged to Lalaâ€™s dream of heaven.
Stories about her father often reached her ears. She knew that he
had held high rank in China before she had been born; but that he had
sacrificed his rights in some way had always been her theory. She had
been too young to understand the stories which her mother had told her
sometimes; but that there were traits in the character of Huang Chow
which it was not good for his daughter to know she appreciated and
accepted as a secret sorrow.
He allowed her all the freedom to which her education entitled her. Her
life was that of a European and not of an Oriental woman. She loved him
in a way, but also feared him. She feared the dark and cruel side of his
character, of which, at various periods during their life together, she
had had terrifying glimpses.
She had decided that cruelty was his vice. In what way he gratified
it she had never learned, nor did she desire to do so. There were
periodical visits from the police, but she had learned long ago that her
father was too clever to place himself within reach of the law.
However crooked one part of his business methods might be, his dealings
with his clients were straight enough, so that no one had any object in
betraying him; and the legality or otherwise of his foreign relations
evidently afforded no case against him upon which the authorities could
act, or upon which they cared to act.
In America it had been graft which had protected him. She had learned
this accidentally, but never knew whether he bought his immunity in the
same way in London.
Some of the rumours which reached her were terrifying. Latterly she had
met many strange glances in her comings and goings about Limehouse. This
peculiar atmosphere had always preceded the break-up of every home which
they had shared. She divined the fact that in some way Huang Chow
had outstayed his welcome in Chinatown, London. Where their next
resting-place would be she could not imagine, but she prayed that it
might be in some more sunny clime.
She found herself to be thinking over much of John Hampden. His bona
fides were not above suspicion, but she could scarcely expect to meet a
really white man in such an environment.
Lala would have liked to think that he was white, but could not force
herself to do so. She would have liked to think that he sought her
company because she appealed to him personally; but she had detected
the fact that another motive underlay his attentions. She wondered if he
could be another of those moths drawn by the light of that fabled wealth
of her father.
It was curious, she reflected, that Huang Chow never checked--indeed,
openly countenanced--her friendship with the many chance acquaintances
she had made, even when her own instincts told her that the men were
crooked; so that, knowing the acumen of her father, she was well aware
that he must know it too.
Several of these pseudo lovers of hers had died. It was a point which
often occurred to her mind, but upon which she did not care to dwell
even now. But John Hampden--John Hampden was different. He was not
wholly sincere. She sighed wearily. But nevertheless he was not like
some of the others.
She started up in bed, seized with a sudden dreadful idea. He was a
detective!
She understood now why she had found so much that was white in him,
but so much that was false. His presence seemed to be very near her.
Something caressing in his voice echoed in her mind. She found herself
to be listening to the muted sounds of Limehouse and of the waterway
which flowed so close beside her.
That old longing for the home of her childhood returned tenfold, and
tears began to trickle down her cheeks. She was falling in love with
this man whose object was her fatherâ€™s ruin. A cold terror clutched
at her heart. Even now, while their friendship was so new, so strange,
there was a query, a stark, terrifying query, to stand up before her.
If put to the test, which would she choose?
She was unable to face that issue, and dropped back upon her pillow,
stifling a sob.
Yes, he was a detective. In some way her father had at last attracted
the serious attention of the law. Rumours of this were flying round
Chinatown, to which she had not been entirely deaf. She thought of a
hundred questions, a hundred silences, and grew more and more convinced
of the truth.
What did he mean to do? Before her a ghostly company uprose--the shadows
of some she had known with designs upon her father. John Hampdenâ€™s
design was different. But might he not join that mysterious company?
Now again she suddenly sprang upright, this time because of a definite
sound which had reached her ears from within the house: a very faint,
bell-like tinkling which ceased almost immediately. She had heard it one
night before, and quite recently; indeed, on the night before she had
met John Hampden. Cohen--Cohen, the Jew, had died that night!
She sprang lightly on to the floor, found her slippers, and threw a silk
kimono over her nightrobe. She tiptoed cautiously to the door and opened
it.
It was at this very moment that old Huang Chow, asleep in his cell-like
apartment, was aroused by the tinkling of a bell set immediately above
his head. He awoke instantly, raised his hand and stopped the bell.
His expression, could anyone have been present to see it, was a thing
unpleasant to behold. Triumph was in it, and cunning cruelty.
His long yellow fingers reached out for his hornrimmed spectacles
which lay upon a little table beside him. Adjusting them, he pulled the
curtains aside and shuffled silently across the large room.
Mounting the steps to the raised writing-table, he rested his elbows
upon it, and peered down at that curious blotting-pad which had so
provoked the curiosity of Durham. Could Durham have seen it now the
mystery must have been solved. It was an ingenious camera obscura
apparatus, and dimly depicted upon its surface appeared a reproduction
of part of the storehouse beneath! The part of it which was visible
was that touched by the light of an electric torch, carried by a man
crossing the floor in the direction of the lacquered coffin upon the
gilded pedestal!
Old Huang Chow chuckled silently, and his yellow fingers clutched the
table edge as he moved to peer more closely into the picture.
NA
It was the man who had come with the introduction from Mr. Isaacs--a new
impostor who sought to rob him, who sought to obtain information from
his daughter, who had examined his premises last night, and had even
penetrated upstairs, so that he, old Huang Chow, had been compelled to
disconnect the apparatus and to feign sleep under the scrutiny of the
intruder.
To-night it would be otherwise. To-night it would be otherwise.
X
THE LACQUERED COFFIN
Durham gently raised the trap in the roof of Huang Chowâ€™s
treasure-house. He was prepared for snares and pitfalls. No sane man, on
the evidence which he, Durham, had been compelled to leave behind, would
have neglected to fasten the skylight which so obviously afforded a
means of entrance into his premises.
Therefore, he was expected to return. The devilish mechanism was set
ready to receive him. But the artist within him demanded that he should
unmask the mystery with his own hands.
Moreover, he doubted that an official visit, even now, would yield any
results. Old Huang Chow was too cunning for that. If he was to learn how
the man Cohen had died, he must follow the same path to the bitter end.
But there were men on duty round the house, and he believed that he had
placed them so secretly as to deceive even this master of cunning with
whom he was dealing.
He repeated his exploit, dropping with a dull thud upon the cushioned
divan. Then, having lain there listening awhile, he pressed the button
of his torch, and, standing up, crept across the room in the direction
of the stairway.
Here he paused awhile, listening intently. The image of Lala Huang arose
before his mindâ€™s eye reproachfully, but he crushed the reproach, and
advanced until he stood beside the lacquered coffin.
He remembered where the key was hidden, and, stooping, he fumbled for a
while and then found it. He was acutely conscious of an unnameable fear.
He felt that he was watched, and yet was unwilling to believe it. The
musty and unpleasant smell which he had noticed before became extremely
perceptible.
He quietly sought for the hidden lock, and, presently finding it,
inserted the key, then paused awhile. He rested his torch upon the
cushions of the divan where the light shone directly upon the coffin.
Then, having his automatic in his left hand, he turned the key.
He had expected now to be able to raise the lid as he had seen Huang
Chow do; but the result was far more surprising.
The lid, together with a second framework of fine netting, flew open
with a resounding bang; and from the interior of the coffin uprose a
most abominable stench.
Durham started back a step, and as he did so witnessed a sight which
turned him sick with horror.
Out on to the edge of the coffin leapt the most gigantic spider which
he had ever seen in his life! It had a body as big as a manâ€™s fist, jet
black, with hairy legs like the legs of a crab and a span of a foot or
more!
A moment it poised there, while he swayed, sick with horror. Then,
unhesitatingly, it leapt for his face!
He groaned and fired, missed the horror, but diverted its leap, so that
it fell with a sickening thud a yard behind him. He turned, staggering
back towards the stair, and aware that a light had shone out from
somewhere.
A door had been opened only a few yards from where he stood, and there,
framed in the opening, was Lala Huang, her eyes wide with terror and her
gaze set upon him across the room.
NA

NA
Her gaze set wildly upon him, Lala staggered forward; stopped dead;
looked down at her bare ankle, and then, seeing the thing which had
fastened upon her, uttered a piercing shriek which rang throughout the
place.
At which moment the floor slid away beneath Durham, and he found himself
falling--falling--and then battling for life in evil-smelling water,
amidst absolute darkness.
Police whistles were skirling around the house of Huang Chow. As the
hidden men came running into the court:

In a few moments, led by the sergeant, the party came dropping heavily
through the skylight into the treasure-house of Huang Chow, in which
every lamp was now alight. A trap was open near the foot of the stairs,
and from beneath it muffled cries proceeded. In this direction the
sergeant headed. Craning over the trap:

The sergeant turned to where, stretched upon a tiger skin before a
half-open door, Lala Huang lay, scantily clothed and white as death.
Upon one of her bare ankles was a discoloured mark.
As the sergeant and another of the men stooped over her a moaning sound
drew their attention to the stair, and there, bent and tottering slowly
down, was old Huang Chow, his eyes peering through the owl-like glasses
vacantly across the room to where his daughter lay.
NA
NA
Two plain-clothes men were busy knotting together tapestries and pieces
of rare stuff with which to draw Durham out of the pit; but at these old
Huang Chow looked not at all, but gropingly crossed the room, as if he
saw imperfectly, or could not believe what he saw. At last he reached
the side of the dead girl, stooped, touched her, laid a trembling yellow
hand over her heart, and then stood up again, looking from face to face.
Ignoring the mingled activities about him, he crossed to the open coffin
and began to fumble amongst the putrefying mass of bones and webbing
which lay therein. Out from this he presently drew an iron coffer.
Carrying it across the room he opened the lid. It was full almost to
the top with uncut gems of every variety--diamonds, rubies, sapphires,
emeralds, topaz, amethysts, flashing greenly, redly, whitely. In
handfuls he grasped them and sprinkled them upon the body of the dead
girl.
NA
The extemporized rope had just been lowered to Durham, when:
NA
NA
He had seen the giant spider, the horror from Surinam, which the
Chinaman had reared and fed to guard his treasure and to gratify his
lust for the strange and cruel. The insect, like everything else in
that house, was unusual, almost unique. It was one of the Black Soldier
spiders, by some regarded as a native myth, but actually existing in
Surinam and parts of Brazil. A member of the family, Mygale, its sting
was more quickly and certainly fatal than that of a rattle-snake. Its
instinct was fearlessly to attack any creature, great or small, which
disturbed it in its dark hiding-place.
Now, with feverish, horrible rapidity it was racing up the tapestries on
the other side of the room.
NA
Snatching a revolver from his pocket he fired shot after shot. The third
hit the thing but did not kill it. It dropped back upon the floor and
began to crawl toward the coffin. The sergeant ran across and at close
quarters shot it again.
Red blood oozed out from the hideous black body and began to form a deep
stain upon the carpet.
When Durham, drenched but unhurt, was hauled back into the
treasure-house, he did not speak, but, scrambling into the room
stood--pallid--staring dully at old Huang Chow.
Huang Chow, upon his knees beside his daughter, was engaged in
sprinkling priceless jewels over her still body, and murmuring in
Chinese:

KERRYâ€™S KID
I
RED KERRY ON DUTY
Chief Inspector Kerry came down from the top of a motor-bus and stood on
the sidewalk for a while gazing to right and left along Piccadilly.
The night was humid and misty, now threatening fog and now rain. Many
travellers were abroad at this Christmas season, the pleasure seekers
easily to be distinguished from those whom business had detained in
town, and who hurried toward their various firesides. The theatres
were disgorging their audiences. Streams of lighted cars bore parties
supperward; less pretentious taxicabs formed links in the chain.
From the little huddled crowd of more economical theatre-goers who
waited at the stopping place of the motor-buses, Kerry detached himself,
walking slowly along westward and staring reflectively about him.
Opposite the corner of Bond Street he stood still, swinging his malacca
cane and gazing fixedly along this narrow bazaar street of the
Baghdad of the West. His trim, athletic figure was muffled in a big,
double-breasted, woolly overcoat, the collar turned up about his ears.
His neat bowler hat was tilted forward so as to shade the fierce blue
eyes. Indeed, in that imperfect light, little of the Chief Inspectorâ€™s
countenance was visible except his large, gleaming white teeth, which he
constantly revealed in the act of industriously chewing mint gum.
He smiled as he chewed. Duty had called him out into the mist, and for
once he had obeyed reluctantly. That very afternoon had seen the return
of Dan Kerry, junior, home from school for the Christmas vacation, and
Dan was the apple of his fatherâ€™s eye.
Mrs. Kerry had reserved her dour Scottish comments upon the boyâ€™s school
report for a more seemly occasion than the first day of his holidays;
but Kerry had made no attempt to conceal his jubilation--almost immoral,
his wife had declared it to be--respecting the ladâ€™s athletic record.
His work on the junior left wing had gained the commendation of a
celebrated international; and Kerry, who had interviewed the gymnasium
instructor, had learned that Dan Junior bade fair to become an amateur
boxer of distinction.

developing a left thatâ€™s going to make history. Iâ€™m of opinion that

Those words had fallen more sweetly upon the ears of Chief Inspector
Kerry than any encomium of the boyâ€™s learning could have done. On the
NA
NA
He remembered that he had promised, despite the lateness of the hour, to
telephone the lad directly he had received a certain report, and to tell
him whether he might wait up for his return or whether he must turn in.
Kerry, stamping his small, neatly shod feet upon the pavement, smiled
agreeably. He was thinking of the telephone which recently he had had
installed in his house in Brixton. His wife had demanded this as a
Christmas box, pointing out how many uneasy hours she would be spared by
the installation. Kerry had consented cheerfully enough, for was he not
shortly to be promoted to the exalted post of a superintendent of the
Criminal Investigation Department?
These reflections were cheering and warming; and, waiting until a gap
occurred in the stream of cabs and cars, he crossed Piccadilly and
proceeded along Bond Street, swinging his shoulders in a manner which
NA
 at a hundred yards.
The fierce eyes scrutinized the occupants of all the lighted cars. At
pedestrians also he stared curiously, and at another smaller group of
travellers waiting for the buses on the left-hand side of the street he
looked hard and long. He pursued his way, acknowledged the salutation
of a porter who stood outside the entrance to the Embassy Club, and
proceeded, glancing about him right and left and with some evident and
definite purpose.
A constable standing at the corner of Conduit Street touched his helmet
as Kerry passed and the light of an arc-lamp revealed the fierce red
face. The Chief Inspector stopped, turned, and:
NA
He snapped out the words in such fashion that the unfortunate constable
almost believed he could see sparks in the misty air.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Kerry tucked his malacca under his arm and walked on, leaving the
unfortunate policeman literally stupefied by his first encounter with
the celebrated Chief Inspector.
Presently another line of cars proclaimed the entrance to a club, and
just before reaching the first of these Kerry paused. A man stood in a
shadowy doorway, and:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Kerry stepped to the edge of the pavement and spat out a piece of
chewing-gum. From his overcoat pocket he drew a fresh piece, tore off
the pink wrapping and placed the gum between his teeth. Then:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
His subordinate stared curiously but made no reply. He was not wholly
in his chiefâ€™s confidence. He merely knew that the name of Lou Chada
to Kerry was like a red rag to a bull. The handsome, cultured young
Eurasian, fresh from a distinguished university career and pampered by a
certain section of smart society, did not conform to Detective Sergeant
Durhamâ€™s idea of a suspect. He knew that Lou was the son of Zani Chada,
and he knew that Zani Chada was one of the wealthiest men in Limehouse.
But Lou had an expensive flat in George Street; Lou was courted by
society butterflies, and in what way he could be connected with the case
NA
NA
with her husband, was conceivable enough; but this was rather a matter
for underhand private inquiry than for the attention of the Criminal
Investigation Department of New Scotland Yard.
So mused Durham, standing cold and uncomfortable in the shadowy doorway,
and dreaming of a certain cosy fireside, a pair of carpet slippers and a
glass of hot toddy which awaited him. Suddenly:
NA
Kerryâ€™s fingers closed, steely, upon Durhamâ€™s wrist. A porter was
urgently moving the parked cars farther along the street to enable one,
a French coupe, to draw up before the club entrance.
Two men came out, supporting between them a woman who seemed to be ill;
a slender, blonde woman whose pretty face was pale and whose wide-open
blue eyes stared strangely straight before her. The taller of her
escorts, while continuing to support her, solicitously wrapped her fur
cloak about her bare shoulders; the other, the manager of the club,
stepped forward and opened the door of the car.
NA
NA
NA
Some little conversation ensued between manager and patron, then the
tall, handsome Eurasian, waving his hand protestingly, removed his hat
and stepped into the coupe beside Lady Rourke. It immediately moved away
in the direction of Piccadilly.
One glimpse Kerry had of the pretty, fair head lying limply back against
the cushions. The manager of the club was staring after the car.
Kerry stepped out from his hiding place. Durham had disappeared, and
there was no cab in sight, but immediately beyond the illuminated
entrance stood a Rolls-Royce which had been fifth in the rank of parked
cars before the adjustment had been made to enable the coupe to reach
the door. Kerry ran across, and:
NA
The latter, resenting the curt tone of the inquiry, looked the speaker
up and down, and:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Kerry shot out a small, muscular hand and grasped the speakerâ€™s wrist.

The Chief Inspector was on the step now, bending forward so that his

chauffeur. The quelling force of his ferocious personality achieved its
purpose, as it rarely failed to do.

Kerry leaped in and banged the door--and the Rolls-Royce started.
II
AT MALAY JACKâ€™S
When Kerry left Bond Street the mistiness of the night was developing
into definite fog. It varied in different districts. Thus, St. Paulâ€™s
Churchyard had been clear of it at a time when it had lain impenetrably
in Trafalgar Square. When, an hour and a half after setting out in the
commandeered Rolls-Royce, Kerry groped blindly along Limehouse Causeway,
it was through a yellow murk that he made his way--a vapour which could
not only be seen, smelled and felt, but tasted.
He was in one of his most violent humours. He found some slight solace
in the reflection that the impudent chauffeur, from whom he had parted
in West India Dock Road, must experience great difficulty in finding his
way back to the West End.
NA
It had tricked him, this floating murk of London; for, while he had been
enabled to keep the coupe in view right to the fringe of dockland, here,
as if bred by old Londonâ€™s river, the fog had lain impenetrably.
Chief Inspector Kerry was a man who took many risks, but because of this
cursed fog he had no definite evidence that Chadaâ€™s car had gone to a
certain house. Right of search he had not, and so temporarily he was
baffled.
Now the nearest telephone was his objective, and presently, where a blue
light dimly pierced the mist, he paused, pushed open a swing door, and
stepped into a long, narrow passage. He descended three stairs, and
entered a room laden with a sickly perfume compounded of stale beer and
spirits; of greasy humanity--European, Asiastic, and African; of cheap
tobacco and cheaper scents; and, vaguely, of opium.
It was fairly well lighted, but the fog had penetrated here, veiling
some of the harshness of its rough appointments. An unsavoury den was
Malay Jackâ€™s, where flotsam of the river might be found. Yellow men
there were, and black men and brown men. But all the women present were
white.
Fan-tan was in progress at one of the tables, the four players being
apparently the only strictly sober people in the room. A woman
was laughing raucously as Kerry entered, and many coarse-voiced
conversations were in progress; but as he pulled the rough curtain walls
aside and walked into the room, a hush, highly complimentary to the
Chief Inspectorâ€™s reputation, fell upon the assembly. Only the womanâ€™s
raucous laughter continued, rising, a hideous solo, above a sort of
NA
Kerry ignored the sensation which his entrance had created, and crossed
the room to a small counter, behind which a dusky man was standing,
coatless and shirt sleeves rolled up. He had the skin of a Malay but
the features of a stage Irishman of the old school. And, indeed, had he
known his own pedigree, which is a knowledge beyond the ken of any man,
partly Irish he might have found himself indeed to be.
This was Malay Jack, the proprietor of one of the roughest houses in
Limehouse. His expression, while propitiatory, was not friendly, but:
NA
NA
NA
NA
He raised a flap in the counter, and Kerry, passing through, entered
a little room behind the bar. Here a telephone stood upon a dirty,
littered table, and, taking it up:
NA
NA
NA
He stood for a while waiting, receiver in hand, and smiled grimly to
note that the uproar in the room beyond had been resumed. Evidently

NA
NA
NA
Station. He followed you in a taxi, but lost you on the way owing to the

NA
NA
NA
NA
He replaced the receiver and paused for a moment, reflecting. Extracting
a piece of tasteless gum from between his teeth, he deposited it in
the grate, where a sickly fire burned; then, tearing the wrapper from
a fresh slip, he resumed his chewing and stood looking about him
with unseeing eyes. Fierce they were as ever, but introspective in
expression.
Famous for his swift decisions, for once in a way he found himself in
doubt. Malay Jack had keen ears, and there were those in the place who
had every reason to be interested in the movements of a member of the
Criminal Investigation Department, especially of one who had earned the
right to be dreaded by the rats of Limehouse. Londonâ€™s peculiar climate
fought against him, but he determined to make no more telephone calls
but to proceed to Limehouse police station.
He stepped swiftly into the bar, and, as he had anticipated, nearly
upset the proprietor, who was standing listening by the half-open door.
Kerry smiled fiercely into the ugly face, lifted the flap, and walked
down the room, through the aisle between the scattered tables, where the
air was heavy with strange perfumes, touched now with the bite of London
fog, and where slanting eyes and straight eyes, sober eyes and drunken
eyes, regarded him furtively. Something of a second hush there was, but
one not so complete as the first.
Kerry pulled the curtain aside, mounted the stair, walked along the
passage and out through the swing door into the yellow gloom of the
Causeway. Ten slow steps he had taken when he detected a sound of
pursuit. Like a flash he turned, clenching his fists. Then:
NA
NA
A dim form loomed up through the fog.
NA
Kerry had paused immediately under a street lamp, and now he looked into
the pinched, lean face of the speaker, and:
NA
NA
Chief Inspector Kerry hesitated. Peters belonged to a class which
Kerry despised with all the force of his straightforward character. A
professional informer has his uses from the police point of view; and
while evidence of this kind often figured in reports made to the Chief
Inspector, he personally avoided contact with such persons, as he
instinctively and daintily avoided contact with personal dirt. But now,
something so big was at stake that his hesitation was only momentary.
A vision of the pale face of Lady Rourke, of the golden head leaning
weakly back upon the cushions of the coupe, as he had glimpsed it in
Bond Street, rose before his mindâ€™s eye as if conjured up out of the
fog. Peters shuffled along beside him, and:
NA
brought a swell girl to the old manâ€™s house an hour ago. I was hanging
about there, thinking I might get some information. I think she was

NA
â€œWell, I was standing over on the other side of the street. Lou Chada
opened the door with a key; and when the light shone out I saw him carry
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The manâ€™s voice shook nervously, and:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Kerry blew down his nose contemptuously, then stopped suddenly.
NA
Silent, they stood in a place of darkness, untouched by any lamplight.
Not a sound reached them through the curtain of fog. Asiatic mystery
wrapped them about, but Kerry experienced only contempt for the
cowardice of his companion, and:
NA
NA
NA
He walked on briskly, tapping the pavement with his malacca. The
sneaking figure of the informer was swallowed up in the fog. But not
a dozen paces had the Chief Inspector gone when he was arrested by a
frenzied scream, rising, hollowly, in a dreadful, muffled crescendo.
Words reached him.
NA
Then came a sort of babbling, which died into a moan.
NA
He turned and began to run back, fumbling in his pocket for his electric
torch. Almost in the same moment that he found it he stumbled upon
Peters, who lay half in the road and half upon the sidewalk.
Kerry pressed the button, and met the glance of upturned, glazing eyes.
Even as he dropped upon his knee beside the dying man, Peters swept his
arm around in a convulsive movement, having the fingers crooked, coughed
horribly, and rolled upon his face.
Switching off the light of the torch, Kerry clenched his jaws in a tense
effort of listening, literally holding his breath. But no sound reached
him through the muffling fog. A moment he hesitated, well knowing his
danger, then viciously snapping on the light again, he quested in the
blood-stained mud all about the body of the murdered man.
NA
It was an exclamation of triumph.
One corner hideously stained, for it had lain half under Petersâ€™s
shoulder, Kerry gingerly lifted between finger and thumb a handkerchief
of fine white silk, such as is carried in the breast pocket of an
evening coat.
It bore an ornate monogram worked in gold, and representing the letters
NA
also bloodstained.
III
THE ROOM OF THE GOLDEN BUDDHA
It was a moot point whether Lady Pat Rourke merited condemnation or
pity. She possessed that type of blonde beauty which seems to be a
lodestone for mankind in general. Her husband was wealthy, twelve
years her senior, and, far from watching over her with jealous care--an
attitude which often characterizes such unions--he, on the contrary,
permitted her a dangerous freedom, believing that she would appreciate
without abusing it.
Her friendship with Lou Chada had first opened his eyes to the perils
which beset the road of least resistance. Sir Noel Rourke was an
Anglo-Indian, and his prejudice against the Eurasian was one not lightly
to be surmounted. Not all the polish which English culture had given to
this child of a mixed union could blind Sir Noel to the yellow streak.
Courted though Chada was by some of the best people, Sir Noel remained
cold.
The long, magnetic eyes, the handsome, clear-cut features, above all,
that slow and alluring smile, appealed to the husband of the wilful
Pat rather as evidences of Oriental, half-effeminate devilry than as
passports to decent society. Oxford had veneered him, but scratch the
veneer and one found the sandal-wood of the East, perfumed, seductive,
appealing, but something to be shunned as brittle and untrustworthy.
Yet he hesitated, seeking to be true to his convictions. Knowing what he
knew already, and what he suspected, it is certain that, could he have
viewed Lou Chada through the eyes of Chief Inspector Kerry, the affair
must have terminated otherwise. But Sir Noel did not know what Kerry
knew. And the pleasure-seeking Lady Rourke, with her hair of spun gold
and her provoking smile, found Lou Chada dangerously fascinating; almost
she was infatuated--she who had known so much admiration.
Of those joys for which thousands of her plainer sisters yearn and
starve to the end of their days she had experienced a surfeit. Always
she sought for novelty, for new adventures. She was confident of
herself, but yet--and here lay the delicious thrill--not wholly
confident. Many times she had promised to visit the house of Lou Chadaâ€™s
father--a mystery palace cunningly painted, a perfumed page from the
Arabian poets dropped amid the interesting squalor of Limehouse.
Perhaps she had never intended to go. Who knows? But on the night when
she came within the ken of Chief Inspector Kerry, Lou Chada had urged
her to do so in his poetically passionate fashion, and, wanting to go,
NA
They had dined, danced, and she had smoked one of the scented cigarettes
which he alone seemed to be able to procure, and which, on their arrival
from the East, were contained in queer little polished wooden boxes.
Then had come an unfamiliar nausea and dizziness, an uncomfortable
recognition of the fact that she was making a fool of herself, and
finally a semi-darkness through which familiar faces loomed up and
were quickly lost again. There was the soft, musical voice of Lou Chada
reassuring her, a sense of chill, of helplessness, and then for a while
an interval which afterward she found herself unable to bridge.
Knowledge of verity came at last, and Lady Pat raised herself from the
divan upon which she had been lying, and, her slender hands clutching
the cushions, stared about her with eyes which ever grew wider.
She was in a long, rather lofty room, which was lighted by three silver
lanterns swung from the ceiling. The place, without containing much
furniture, was a riot of garish, barbaric colour. There were deep divans
cushioned in amber and blood-red. Upon the floor lay Persian carpets
and skins of beasts. Cunning niches there were, half concealing and half
revealing long-necked Chinese jars; and odd little carven tables bore
strangely fashioned vessels of silver. There was a cabinet of ebony
inlaid with jade, there were black tapestries figured with dragons of
green and gold. Curtains she saw of peacock-blue; and in a tall, narrow
recess, dominating the room, squatted a great golden Buddha.
The atmosphere was laden with a strange perfume.
But, above all, this room was silent, most oppressively silent.
Lady Pat started to her feet. The whole perfumed place seemed to be
swimming around her. Reclosing her eyes, she fought down her weakness.
The truth, the truth respecting Lou Chada and herself, had uprisen
starkly before her. By her own folly--and she could find no
tiny excuse--she had placed herself in the power of a man whom,
instinctively, deep within her soul, she had always known to be utterly
unscrupulous.
How cleverly he had concealed the wild animal which dwelt beneath
that suave, polished exterior! Yet how ill he had concealed it! For
intuitively she had always recognized its presence, but had deliberately
closed her eyes, finding a joy in the secret knowledge of danger. Now at
last he had discarded pretense.
The cigarette which he had offered her at the club had been drugged. She
was in Limehouse, at the mercy of a man in whose veins ran the blood of
ancestors to whom women had been chattels. Too well she recognized that
his passion must have driven him insane, as he must know at what cost
he took such liberties with one who could not lightly be so treated. But
these reflections afforded poor consolation. It was not of the penalties
that Lou Chada must suffer for this infringement of Western codes, but
of the price that she must pay for her folly, of which Pat was thinking.
There was a nauseating taste upon her palate. She remembered having
noticed it faintly while she was smoking the cigarette; indeed, she had
commented upon it at the time.
NA
She merely echoed what many a man had said before her. She wondered at
herself, and in doing so but wondered at the mystery of womanhood.
Clarity was returning. The room no longer swam around her. She crossed
in the direction of a garish curtain, which instinctively she divined to
mask a door. Dragging it aside, she tried the handle, but the door was
locked. A second door she found, and this also proved to be locked.
There was one tall window, also covered by ornate draperies, but it
was shuttered, and the shutters had locks. Another small window she
discovered, glazed with amber glass, but set so high in the wall as to
be inaccessible.
Dread assailed her, and dropping on to one of the divans, she hid her
face in her hands.
NA
For a long time she remained there, listening for any sound which should
disperse the silence. She thought of her husband, of the sweet security
of her home, of the things which she had forfeited because of this mad
quest of adventure. And presently a key grated in a lock.
Lady Pat started to her feet with a wild, swift action which must have
reminded a beholder of a startled gazelle. The drapery masking the door
which she had first investigated was drawn aside. A man entered and
dropped the curtain behind him.
Exactly what she had expected she could not have defined, but the
presence of this perfect stranger was a complete surprise. The man,
who wore embroidered slippers and a sort of long blue robe, stood there
regarding her with an expression which, even in her frantic condition,
she found to be puzzling. He had long, untidy gray hair brushed back
from his low brow; eyes strangely like the eyes of Lou Chada, except
that they were more heavy-lidded; but his skin was as yellow as a
guinea, and his gaunt, cleanshaven face was the face of an Oriental.
The slender hands, too, which he held clasped before him, were yellow,
and possessed a curiously arresting quality. Pat imagined them clasped
about her white throat, and her very soul seemed to shrink from the man
who stood there looking at her with those long, magnetic, inscrutable
eyes.
She wondered why she was surprised, and suddenly realized that it was
because of the expression in his eyes, for it was an expression of cold
anger. Then the intruder spoke.
NA
to her, but in a voice which was not unlike the voice of Lou Chada. â€œWho

This was so wholly unexpected that for a moment she found herself unable
to reply, but finally:

slightly the intonation had varied.

NA
The man standing before the curtained door slightly inclined his head.
NA

NA
Tone and glance were coldly angry. Then, before the frightened woman
could say another word, the man in the blue robe robe withdrew, the
curtain was dropped again, and she heard the grating of a key in the
lock. She ran to the door, beating upon it with her clenched hands.
NA
NA
No one answered, and, turning, she leaned back against the curtain,
breathing heavily and fighting for composure, for strength.

ZANI CHADA, THE EURASIAN

truculently at the speaker.
â€œNo, I canâ€™t. Since you cleaned up the dope gang down here youâ€™ve been
a marked man. These murders in the Chinatown area, of which this one
to-night makes the third, have got some kind of big influence behind
them. Yet you wander about in the fog without even a gun in your

The other laughed, shaking his head.
NA
there in the fog to-night might have knifed you or shot you long before
NA
NA
Yet, remembering his wife, who would be waiting for him in the cosy
sitting-room he knew a sudden pang. Perhaps he did take unnecessary
chances. Others had said so. Hard upon the thought came the memory of
his boy, and of the telephone message which the episodes of the night
had prevented him from sending.
He remembered, too, something which his fearless nature had prompted him
to forget: he remembered how, just as he had arisen from beside the body
of the murdered man, oblique eyes had regarded him swiftly out of the
fog. He had lashed out with a boxerâ€™s instinct, but his knuckles had
encountered nothing but empty air. No sound had come to tell him that
the thing had not been an illusion. Only, once again, as he groped his
way through the shuttered streets of Chinatown and the silence of
the yellow mist, something had prompted him to turn; and again he had
detected the glint of oblique eyes, and faintly had discerned the form
of one who followed him.
Kerry chewed viciously, then:
NA
NA
Almost before he had finished speaking the â€˜phone bell rang, and a few
moments later:
NA

NA

He was answered by an unfamiliar voice, a voice which had a queer,
guttural intonation. It was the sort of voice he had learned to loathe.

intellect. He wondered greatly, but:

The voice ceased, and Kerry remaining silent, immediately continued:
â€œKnowing your personal character, I doubt if you have communicated the
fact of your possessing this evidence to anyone else. I suggest, in your

Kerry thought rapidly, and then:
NA
I shall leave a sealed statement in possession of the officer in charge
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
His red moustache positively bristled, and he clutched the receiver so
tightly that it quivered against his ear.
NA

Kerry chewed furiously for ten momentous seconds, then:
NA
He replaced the receiver on the hook, and, walking across to the charge
desk, took an official form and a pen. On the back of the form he
scribbled rapidly, watched with curiosity by the officer in charge.
NA
An envelope was found and handed to him. He placed the paper in the
envelope, gummed down the lapel, and addressed it in large, bold writing
to the Assistant Commissioner of the Criminal Investigation Department,
who was his chief. Finally:
NA
NA
â€œAfter what youâ€™ve said. Iâ€™m going out. If I donâ€™t come back or donâ€™t

The Limehouse official stared perplexedly.
NA

NA
NA
NA
under his arm, strode out into the fog.
His knowledge of the Limehouse area was extensive and peculiar, so that
twenty minutes later, having made only one mistake in the darkness, he
was pressing an electric bell set beside a door which alone broke the
expanse of a long and dreary brick wall, lining a street which neither
by day nor night would have seemed inviting to the casual visitor.
The door was opened by a Chinaman wearing national dress, revealing
a small, square lobby, warmly lighted and furnished Orientally. Kerry
stepped in briskly.
â€œI want to see Mr. Zani Chada. Tell him I am here. Chief Inspector Kerry
NA
The Chinaman bowed, crossed the lobby, and, drawing some curtains aside,
walked up four carpeted stairs and disappeared into a short passage
revealed by the raising of the tapestry. As he did so Kerry stared about
him curiously.
He had never before entered the mystery house of Zani Chada, nor had he
personally encountered the Eurasian, reputed to be a millionaire,
but who chose, for some obscure reason, to make his abode in this old
rambling building, once a country mansion, which to-day was closely
invested by dockland and the narrow alleys of Chinatown. It was
curiously still in the lobby, and, as he determined, curiously Eastern.
He was conscious of a sense of exhilaration. That Zani Chada controlled
powerful influences, he knew well. But, reviewing the precautions
which he had taken, Kerry determined that the trump card was in his
possession.
The Chinese servant descended the stairs again and intimated that the
visitor should follow him. Kerry, carrying his hat and cane, mounted the
stairs, walked along the carpeted passage, and was ushered into a queer,
low room furnished as a library.
It was lined with shelves containing strange-looking books, none of
which appeared to be English. Upon the top of the shelves were grotesque
figures of gods, pieces of Chinese pottery and other Oriental ornaments.
Arms there were in the room, and rich carpets, carven furniture, and an
air of luxury peculiarly exotic. Furthermore, he detected a faint smell
of opium from which fact he divined that Zani Chada was addicted to the
national vice of China.
Seated before a long narrow table was the notorious Eurasian. The table
contained a number of strange and unfamiliar objects, as well as a small
rack of books. An opium pipe rested in a porcelain bowl.
Zani Chada, wearing a blue robe, sat in a cushioned chair, staring
toward the Chief Inspector. With one slender yellow hand he brushed his
untidy gray hair. His long magnetic eyes were half closed.
NA
NA
The long eyes grew a little more narrow--the only change of expression
that Zani Chada allowed himself.
NA
In that queer, perfumed room, with the suggestion of something sinister
underlying its exotic luxury, arose a kind of astral clash as the
powerful personality of the Eurasian came in contact with that of Kerry.
In a sense it was a contest of rapier and battle-axe; an insidious but
powerful will enlisted against the bulldog force of the Chief Inspector.
Still through half-closed eyes Zani Chada watched his visitor, who
stood, feet apart and chin thrust forward aggressively, staring with
wide open, fierce blue eyes at the other.
NA
in a manner little short of ferocious. He laid his hat and cane upon a
chair and took a step in the direction of the narrow, laden table. â€œMake
me any kind of offer to buy back the evidence you think Iâ€™ve got, and
NA
The yellow hands of Zani Chada clutched the metal knobs which ornamented
the arms of the chair in which he was seated. The long eyes now
presented the appearance of being entirely closed; otherwise he remained
immovable.
Following a short, portentous silence:
NA
speaking very softly. â€œYou are shortly to be promoted to a post which no
one is better fitted to occupy. You enjoy great domestic happiness, and
you possess a son in whom you repose great hopes. In this respect Chief
NA
Kerryâ€™s nostrils were widely dilated, but he did not speak.
NA
Indeed, I have watched your career with interest. Now, to be brief, a
great scandal may be averted and a womanâ€™s reputation preserved if you
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThere are two people in it I want for two different reasons. If you say
NA
Chada raised his hand slowly.
NA
There was a curious restraint in the Eurasianâ€™s manner which Kerry
distrusted, but for which at the time he was at a loss to account. Then
suddenly he determined that the man was waiting for something, listening
for some sound. As if to confirm this reasoning, just at that moment a
sound indeed broke the silence of the room.
Somewhere far away in the distance of the big house a gong was beaten
three times softly. Kerryâ€™s fierce glance searched the face of Zani
Chada, but it remained mask-like, immovable. Yet that this had been a
signal of some kind the Chief Inspector did not doubt, and:
NA
without my knowledge, and because of what happened out there in the fog
NA
He took up his hat and cane from the chair.
NA
Zani Chada stood up slowly.
NA
NA
NA
â€œI mean that any steps you may take now can only lead to disaster for
NA
Kerry took a step forward, two steps, then paused. He was considering
certain words which the Eurasian had spoken. Without fearing the man
in the physical sense, he was not fool enough to underestimate his
potentialities for evil and his power to strike darkly.
NA
I have not advised lightly. I will receive you, Chief Inspector, at any
hour of the night you care to return. By to-morrow, if you wish, you may
NA
Kerry clenched his fists.
NA
Kerryâ€™s teeth snapped together audibly; then, putting on his hat, he
turned and walked straight to the door.
V
DAN KERRY, JUNIOR
Dan Kerry, junior, was humorously like his father, except that he was
larger-boned and promised to grow into a much bigger man. His hair was
uncompromisingly red, and grew in such irregular fashion that the comb
was not made which could subdue it. He had the wide-open, fighting blue
eyes of the Chief Inspector, and when he smiled the presence of two
broken teeth lent him a very pugilistic appearance.
On his advent at the school of which he was now one of the most popular
NA
young Kerry had always taken exception, and he proceeded to display
his prejudice on the first day of his arrival with such force and
determination that the sobriquet had been withdrawn by tacit consent of
every member of the form who hitherto had favoured it.
NA
NA
NA
The sheer impudence of the thing had astounded everybody. Young Kerryâ€™s
treatment of his leading persecutor had produced a salutary change of
opinion. Of such kidney was Daniel Kerry, junior; and when, some hours
after his fatherâ€™s departure on the night of the murder in the fog, the
â€˜phone bell rang, it was Dan junior, and not his mother, who answered
the call.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
his fatherâ€™s activities.
â€œWell, get it. Jump on a tram at the Town Hall and bring the overall
NA
NA
NA
Mrs. Kerry was sewing by the fire in the dining room when her son came
in with the news, his blue eyes sparkling excitedly. She nodded her head
slowly.
NA
muffler, too, and yeâ€™r oldest cap. I think itâ€™s madness for ye to go out
NA
NA
NA
However, some ten minutes later young Kerry set out, keenly resenting
the woollen muffler which he had been compelled to wear, and secretly
determined to remove it before mounting the tram. Across one arm he
carried the glistening overall which was the Chief Inspectorâ€™s constant
companion on wet nights abroad. The fog had turned denser, and ten paces
from the door of the house took him out of sight of the light streaming
from the hallway.
Mary Kerry well knew her husbandâ€™s theories about coddling boys, but
even so could not entirely reconcile herself to the present expedition.
However, closing the door, she returned philosophically to her sewing,
reflecting that little harm could come to Dan after all, for he was
strong, healthy, and intelligent.
On went the boy through the mist, whistling merrily. Not twenty yards
from the house a coupe was drawn up, and by the light of one of its
lamps a man was consulting a piece of paper on which, presumably, an
address was written; for, as the boy approached, the man turned, his
collar pulled up about his face, his hat pulled down.
NA
He spoke with a curious accent, unfamiliar to the boy. â€œA foreigner of
NA
NA
NA
continued, holding up the paper which he had been scrutinizing.
Dan stepped forward and bent over it. He could not make out the writing,
and bent yet more, holding it nearer to the lamp. At which moment some
second person neatly pinioned him from behind, a scarf was whipped about
his head, and, kicking furiously but otherwise helpless, he felt himself
lifted and placed inside the car.
The muffler had been thrown in such fashion about his face as to leave
one eye partly free, and as he was lifted he had a momentary glimpse of
his captors. With a thrill of real, sickly terror he realized that he
was in the hands of Chinamen!
Perhaps telepathically this spasm of fear was conveyed to his father,
for it was at about this time that the latter was interviewing Zani
Chada, and at about this time that Kerry recognized, underlying the
otherâ€™s words, at once an ill-concealed suspense and a threat. Then,
a few minutes later, had come the three strokes of the gong; and again
that unreasonable dread had assailed him, perhaps because it signalized
the capture of his son, news of which had been immediately telephoned to
Limehouse by Zani Chadaâ€™s orders.
Certain it is that Kerry left the Eurasianâ€™s house in a frame of mind
which was not familiar to him. He was undecided respecting his next
move. A deadly menace underlay Chadaâ€™s words.
NA
opened for him by the Chinese servant, he paused a moment before going
out into the fog. There were men on duty at the back and at the front of
the house. Should he risk all and raid the place? That Lady Rourke was
captive here he no longer doubted. But it was equally certain that no
further harm would come to her at the hands of her captors, since she
had been traced there and since Zani Chada was well aware of the fact.
Of the whereabouts of Lou Chada he could not be certain. If he was in
the house, they had him.
The door was closed by the Chinaman, and Kerry stood out in the darkness
of the dismal, brick-walled street, feeling something as nearly akin
to dejection as was possible in one of his mercurial spirit. Something
trickled upon the brim of his hat, and, raising his head, Kerry detected
rain upon his upturned face. He breathed a prayer of thankfulness. This
would put an end to the fog.
He began to walk along by the high brick wall, but had not proceeded far
before a muffled figure arose before him and the light of an electric
torch was shone into his face.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The rain now was definitely conquering the fog, and in half the time
which had been occupied by the outward journey Kerry was back again in
Limehouse police station. Unconsciously he had been hastening his pace
with every stride, urged onward by an unaccountable anxiety, so that
finally he almost ran into the office and up to the desk where the
telephone stood.
Lifting it, he called his own number and stood tapping his foot,
impatiently awaiting the reply. Presently came the voice of the
NA
NA
NA
Kerryâ€™s anxiety became acute, almost unendurable; and when at last,
after repeated attempts, no reply could be obtained from his home, he
replaced the receiver and leaned for a moment on the desk, shaken with
such a storm of apprehension as he had rarely known. He turned to the
inspector in charge, and:
NA
someone â€˜phone for a taxi; they are to keep on till they get one. Where
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes. But apart from keeping a close watch upon the house of Zani Chada
NA
NA
NA
NA
Indeed, he paced up and down the room like a wild beast caged, while
call after call was sent to neighbouring cab ranks, for a long time
without result. What did it mean, his wifeâ€™s failure to answer the
telephone? It might mean that neither she nor their one servant nor Dan
was in the house. And if they were not in the house at this hour of the
night, where could they possibly be? This it might mean, or--something
worse.
A thousand and one possibilities, hideous, fantastic, appalling, flashed
through his mind. He was beginning to learn what Zani Chada had meant
NA
At last a taxi was found, and the man instructed over the â€˜phone to
proceed immediately to Limehouse station. He seemed so long in coming
that when at last the cab was heard to pause outside, Kerry could not
trust himself to speak to the driver, but directed a sergeant to give
him the address. He entered silently and closed the door.
A steady drizzle of rain was falling. It had already dispersed the fog,
so that he might hope with luck to be home within the hour. As a matter
of fact, the man performed the journey in excellent time, but it seemed
to his passenger that he could have walked quicker, such was the gnawing
anxiety within him and the fear which prompted him to long for wings.
Instructing the cabman to wait, Kerry unlocked the front door and
entered. He had noted a light in the dining room window, and entering,
he found his wife awaiting him there. She rose as he entered, with
horror in her comely face.
NA
NA
apprehensions had been groundless. â€œBut how was it that you did not
NA
NA
wider. â€œThe boy answered, Dan. He set out wiâ€™ yeâ€™r mackintosh full an
NA
NA
The truth leaped out at Kerry like an enemy out of ambush.
NA
â€œSomeone frae the Yard, to tell the boy to bring yeâ€™r mackintosh alone
NA
She advanced, hands outstretched, quivering, but Kerry had leaped out
into the narrow hallway. He raised the telephone receiver, listened for
a moment, and then jerked it back upon the hook.
NA
NA
His wife came out to where he stood, and, clenching his teeth very
grimly, he took her in his arms. She was shaking as if palsied.
NA
NA
She looked at him with haggard, tearless eyes.
NA
His fingers tightened on her shoulders.
NA
NA
He trusted himself no further, but, clapping his hat on his head, walked
out to the waiting cab.

VI
THE KNIGHT ERRANT
Recognizing the superior strength of his captors, young Kerry soon gave
up struggling. The thrill of his first real adventure entered into his
blood. He remembered that he was the son of his father, and he realized,
being a quick-witted lad, that he was in the grip of enemies of his
father. The panic which had threatened him when first he had recognized
that he was in the hands of Chinese, gave place to a cold rage--a
heritage which in later years was to make him a dangerous man.
He lay quite passively in the grasp of someone who held him fast, and
learned, by breathing quietly, that the presence of the muffler about
his nose and mouth did not greatly inconvenience him. There was some
desultory conversation between the two men in the car, but it
was carried on in an odd, sibilant language which the boy did not
understand, but which he divined to be Chinese. He thought how every
other boy in the school would envy him, and the thought was stimulating,
nerving. On the very first day of his holidays he was become the central
figure of a Chinatown drama.
The last traces of fear fled. His position was uncomfortable and his
limbs were cramped, but he resigned himself, with something almost like
gladness, and began to look forward to that which lay ahead with a zest
and a will to be no passive instrument which might have surprised his
captors could they have read the mind of their captive.
The journey seemed almost interminable, but young Kerry suffered it in
stoical silence until the car stopped and he was lifted and carried down
stone steps into some damp, earthy-smelling place. Some distance was
traversed, and then many flights of stairs were mounted, some bare but
others carpeted.
Finally he was deposited in a chair, and as he raised his hand to the
scarf, which toward the end of the journey had been bound more tightly
about his head so as to prevent him from seeing at all, he heard a door
closed and locked.
The scarf was quickly removed. And Dan found himself in a low-ceilinged
attic having a sloping roof and one shuttered window. A shadeless
electric lamp hung from the ceiling. Excepting the cane-seated chair in
which he had been deposited and a certain amount of nondescript lumber,
the attic was unfurnished. Dan rapidly considered what his father would
have done in the circumstances.
NA
He tried it, and it was locked beyond any shadow of doubt.
NA
Shutters covered it, and these were fastened with a padlock.
He considered this padlock attentively; then, drawing from his pocket
one of those wonderful knives which are really miniature tool-chests, he
raised from a grove the screw-driver which formed part of its equipment,
and with neatness and dispatch unscrewed the staple to which the padlock
was attached!
A moment later he had opened the shutters and was looking out into the
drizzle of the night.
The room in which he was confined was on the third floor of a dingy,
brick-built house; a portion of some other building faced him; down
below was a stone-paved courtyard. To the left stood a high wall, and
beyond it he obtained a glimpse of other dingy buildings. One lighted
window was visible--a square window in the opposite building, from which
amber light shone out.
Somewhere in the street beyond was a standard lamp. He could detect the
halo which it cast into the misty rain. The glass was very dirty, and
young Kerry raised the sash, admitting a draught of damp, cold air into
the room. He craned out, looking about him eagerly.
A rainwater-pipe was within reach of his hand on the right of the window
and, leaning out still farther, young Kerry saw that it passed beside
two other, larger, windows on the floor beneath him. Neither of these
showed any light.
Dizzy heights have no terror for healthy youth. The brackets supporting
the rain-pipe were a sufficient staircase for the agile Dan, a more
slippery prisoner than the famous Baron Trenck; and, discarding his
muffler and his Burberry, he climbed out upon the sill and felt with his
thick-soled boots for the first of these footholds. Clutching the ledge,
he lowered himself and felt for the next.
Then came the moment when he must trust all his weight to the pipe.
Clenching his teeth, he risked it, felt for and found the third angle,
and then, still clutching the pipe, stood for a moment upon the ledge
of the window immediately beneath him. He was curious respecting the
lighted window of the neighbouring house; and, twisting about, he bent,
peering across--and saw a sight which arrested his progress.
The room within was furnished in a way which made him gasp with
astonishment. It was like an Eastern picture, he thought. Her golden
hair dishevelled and her hands alternately clenching and unclenching,
a woman whom he considered to be most wonderfully dressed was pacing
wildly up and down, a look of such horror upon her pale face that Danâ€™s
heart seemed to stop beating for a moment!
Here was real trouble of a sort which appealed to all the chivalry
in the boyâ€™s nature. He considered the window, which was glazed with
amber-coloured glass, observed that it was sufficiently open to enable
him to slip the fastening and open it entirely could he but reach it.
And--yes!--there was a rain-pipe!
Climbing down to the yard, he looked quickly about him, ran across, and
climbed up to the lighted window. A moment later he had pushed it widely
open.
He was greeted by a stifled cry, but, cautiously transferring his weight
from the friendly pipe to the ledge, he got astride of it, one foot in
the room. Then, by exercise of a monkey-like agility, he wriggled his
head and shoulders within.
NA
NA
Her hands clasped convulsively together, the woman stood looking up at
him.
NA
NA
NA
NA
He performed a singular contortion, as a result of which his other leg
and foot appeared inside the window. Then, twisting around, he lowered
himself and dropped triumphantly upon a cushioned divan. At that moment
he would have faced a cage full of man-eating tigers. The spirit of
adventure had him in its grip. He stood up, breathing rapidly, his crop
of red hair more dishevelled than usual.
Then, before he could stir or utter any protest, the golden-haired
princess whom he had come to rescue stooped, threw her arms around his
neck, and kissed him.
NA
NA
Young Kerry, more flushed than ever, extricated himself, and:

VII
RETRIBUTION
It was that dark, still, depressing hour of the night, when all life
is at its lowest ebb. In the low, strangely perfumed room of books Zani
Chada sat before his table, his yellow hands clutching the knobs on his
chair arms, his long, inscrutable eyes staring unseeingly before him.
Came a disturbance and the sound of voices, and Lou Chada, his son,
stood at the doorway. He still wore his evening clothes, but he no
longer looked smart. His glossy black hair was dishevelled, and his
handsome, olive face bore a hunted look. Panic was betoken by twitching
mouth and fear-bright eyes. He stopped, glaring at his father, and:
NA
NA
â€œThe police have posted a man opposite Kweeâ€™s house. I cannot get out
NA
NA
NA
NA
Zani Chada stirred not a muscle, but:
NA
For the sake of a golden doll who is not worth the price of the jewels

NA

NA
NA
In some distant part of the house a gong was struck three times.
NA
you. Let Ah Fang go to the room above and see that the woman is silent.
NA
Lou Chada raised his hands, brushing the hair back from his wet
forehead, then, staring haggardly at his father, turned and ran from the
room.
A minute later Kerry was ushered in by the Chinese servant. The savage
face was set like a mask. Without removing his hat, he strode across
to the table and bent down so that fierce, wide-open blue eyes stared
closely into long, half-closed black ones.
NA
hangman may do to your slimy son, and whatever happens to the little
blonde fool he kidnapped, if youâ€™ve laid a hand on my kid Iâ€™ll kick you
NA
Zani Chada made no reply, but his knuckles gleamed, so tightly did he
clutch the knobs on the chair arms. Kerryâ€™s savagery would have awed
any man, even though he had supposed it to be the idle threat of a
passionate man. But Zani Chada knew all men, and he knew this one. When
Daniel Kerry declared that in given circumstances he would kick Zani
Chada to death, he did not mean that he would shoot him, strangle him,
or even beat him with his fists; he meant precisely what he said--that
he would kick him to death--and Zani Chada knew it.
Thus there were some moments of tense silence during which the savage
face of the Chief Inspector drew even closer to the gaunt, yellow face
of the Eurasian. Finally:
NA
its guttural intonation. He spoke softly, sibilantly. â€œI, too, am a
NA
NA
to tear your house down brick by brick Iâ€™ll find him. And if youâ€™ve hurt
NA
He quivered. The effort of suppression which he had imposed upon himself
was frightful to witness. Zani Chada, student of men, knew that in
despite of his own physical strength and of the hidden resources at his
beck, he stood nearer to primitive retribution than he had ever done.
Yet:
NA
not in this house. Oh! violence cannot avail! It can only make his loss
NA
Kerry, nostrils distended, eyes glaring madly, bent over him.
NA
His adventures have twice before ended in murder--and you have covered
him. This time you canâ€™t do it. Iâ€™m not to be bought. Weâ€™ve stood for
the Far East in London long enough. Your cub hangs this time. Get me?
Thereâ€™ll be no bargaining. The womanâ€™s reputation wonâ€™t stop me. My
kidâ€™s danger wonâ€™t stop me. But if you try to use him as a lever Iâ€™ll
boot you to your stinking yellow paradise and theyâ€™ll check you in as

NA
Kerry clenched his teeth so tightly that his maxillary muscles protruded
to an abnormal degree. He thrust his clenched fists into his coat
pockets.
NA
best of our abilities. But is professional kudos not too dearly bought
at the price of a loved one lost for ever? A far better bargain
would be, shall we say, ten thousand pounds, as the price of a silk
NA
Kerryâ€™s fierce blue eyes closed for a fraction of a second. Yet, in that
fraction of a second, he had visualized some of the things which ten
thousand pounds--a sum he could never hope to possess--would buy. He had
seen his home, as he would have it--and he had seen Dan there, safe and
happy at his motherâ€™s side. Was he entitled to disregard the happiness
of his wife, the life of his boy, the honourable name of Sir
Noel Rourke, because an outcast like Peters had come to a fitting
end--because a treacherous Malay and a renegade Chinaman had, earlier,
gone the same way, sped, as he suspected, by the same hand?
NA
NA
So far he had proceeded when he was interrupted; and the cause of the
interruption was this:
A few moments earlier another dramatic encounter had taken place in a
distant part of the house. Kerry Junior, having scientifically tested
all the possible modes of egress from the room in which Lady Pat was
confined, had long ago desisted, and had exhausted his ingenuity in
plans which discussion had proved to be useless. In spite of the novelty
and the danger of his situation, nature was urging her laws. He was
growing sleepy. The crowning tragedy had been the discovery that he
could not regain the small, square window set high in the wall from
which he had dropped into this luxurious prison. Now, as the two sat
side by side upon a cushioned divan, the womanâ€™s arm about the boyâ€™s
shoulders, they were startled to hear, in the depths of the house, three
notes of a gong.
Young Kerryâ€™s sleepiness departed. He leapt to his feet as though
electrified.
NA
There was something horrifying in those gong notes in the stillness of
the night. Lady Patâ€™s beautiful eyes grew glassy with fear.
NA
He ran to the door, drew the curtain aside, and pressed his ear against
one of the panels, listening intently. As he did so, his attitude grew
tense, his expression changed, then:
NA
NA
NA
NA
He bent to press his ear to the panel again, when a stifled cry from his
companion brought him swiftly to his feet. The second door in the room
had opened silently, and a small Chinaman, who carried himself with a
stoop, had entered, and now, a menacing expression upon his face, was
quickly approaching the boy.
What he had meant to do for ever remained in doubt, for young Kerry,
knowing his father to be in the house and seeing an open door before
him, took matters into his own hands. At the moment that the silent
Chinaman was about to throw his arms about him, the pride of the junior
school registered a most surprising left accurately on the point of Ah
Fangâ€™s jaw, following it up by a wilful transgression of Queensberry
rules in the form of a stomach punch which temporarily decided the
issue. Then:
NA
NA
In such fashion was Zani Chada interrupted, the interruption taking the
form of a sudden, shrill outcry:
NA
Kerry spun about as a man galvanized. His face became transfigured.
NA
Came a clatter of hurrying feet, and into the low, perfumed room
burst Dan Kerry, junior, tightly clasping the hand of a pale-faced,
dishevelled woman in evening dress. It was Lady Rourke; and although
she seemed to be in a nearly fainting condition, Dan dragged her, half
running, into the room.
Kerry gave one glance at the pair, then, instantly, he turned to face
Zani Chada. The latter, like a man of stone, sat in his carved chair,
eyes nearly closed. The Chief Inspector whipped out a whistle and raised
it to his lips. He blew three blasts upon it.
From one--two--three--four points around the house the signal was
answered.
Zani Chada fully opened his long, basilisk eyes.
NA
NA
NA
the boy.
NA
A tremendous uproar arose, within and without the house. The police
were raiding the place. Lady Rourke sank down, slowly, almost at the
Eurasianâ€™s feet.
But Chief Inspector Kerry experienced an unfamiliar chill as his
uncompromising stare met the cold hatred which blazed out of the black
eyes, narrowed, now, and serpentine, of Zani Chada.
THE PIGTAIL OF HI WING HO
I
HOW I OBTAINED IT
Leaving the dock gates behind me I tramped through the steady drizzle,
going parallel with the river and making for the Chinese quarter. The
hour was about half-past eleven on one of those September nights when,
in such a locality as this, a stifling quality seems to enter the
atmosphere, rendering it all but unbreathable. A mist floated over
the river, and it was difficult to say if the rain was still falling,
indeed, or if the ample moisture upon my garments was traceable only to
the fog. Sounds were muffled, lights dimmed, and the frequent hooting of
sirens from the river added another touch of weirdness to the scene.
Even when the peculiar duties of my friend, Paul Harley, called him
away from England, the lure of this miniature Orient which I had first
explored under his guidance, often called me from my chambers. In the
house with the two doors in Wade Street, Limehouse, I would discard the
armour of respectability, and, dressed in a manner unlikely to provoke
comment in dockland, would haunt those dreary ways sometimes from
midnight until close upon dawn. Yet, well as I knew the district and
the strange and often dangerous creatures lurking in its many burrows, I
experienced a chill partly physical and partly of apprehension to-night;
indeed, strange though it may sound, I hastened my footsteps in order
the sooner to reach the low den for which I was bound--Malay Jackâ€™s--a
spot marked plainly on the crimes-map and which few respectable
travellers would have regarded as a haven of refuge.
But the chill of the adjacent river, and some quality of utter
desolation which seemed to emanate from the deserted wharves and
ramshackle buildings about me, were driving me thither now; for I knew
that human companionship, of a sort, and a glass of good liquor--from
a store which the Customs would have been happy to locate--awaited me
there. I might chance, too, upon Durham or Wessex, of New Scotland Yard,
both good friends of mine, or even upon the Terror of Chinatown, Chief
Inspector Kerry, a man for whom I had an esteem which none of his
ungracious manners could diminish.
I was just about to turn to the right into a narrow and nameless alley,
lying at right angles to the Thames, when I pulled up sharply, clenching
my fists and listening.
A confused and continuous sound, not unlike that which might be
occasioned by several large and savage hounds at close grips, was
proceeding out of the darkness ahead of me; a worrying, growling, and
scuffling which presently I identified as human, although in fact it
was animal enough. A moment I hesitated, then, distinguishing among
the sounds of conflict an unmistakable, though subdued, cry for help,
I leaped forward and found myself in the midst of the melee. This was
taking place in the lee of a high, dilapidated brick wall. A lamp in a
sort of iron bracket spluttered dimly above on the right, but the
scene of the conflict lay in densest shadow, so that the figures were
indistinguishable.
NA
From almost at my feet the cry arose and was drowned in Chinese
chattering. But guided by it I now managed to make out that the struggle
in progress waged between a burly English sailorman and two lithe
Chinese. The yellow men seemed to have gained the advantage and my
course was clear.
A straight right on the jaw of the Chinaman who was engaged in
endeavouring to throttle the victim laid him prone in the dirty roadway.
His companion, who was holding the wrist of the recumbent man, sprang
upright as though propelled by a spring. I struck out at him savagely.
He uttered a shrill scream not unlike that of a stricken hare, and fled
so rapidly that he seemed to melt in the mist.
NA
man, extricating himself from beneath the body of his stunned assailant,
rose unsteadily to his feet and lurched toward me.
As I had surmised, he was a sailor, wearing a rough, blue-serge jacket
and having his greasy trousers thrust into heavy seaboots--by which I
judged that he was but newly come ashore. He stooped and picked up his
cap. It was covered in mud, as were the rest of his garments, but he
brushed it with his sleeve as though it had been but slightly soiled and
clapped it on his head.
He grasped my hand in a grip of iron, peering into my face, and his
breath was eloquent.

As if to settle my doubts, the recumbent figure suddenly arose and
without a word fled into the darkness and was gone like a phantom. My

With surprising steadiness of gait, considering the liquid cargo he had
aboard, the man, releasing my hand and now seizing me firmly by the
arm, confidently led me by divers narrow ways, which I knew, to a little
beerhouse frequented by persons of his class.
My own attire was such as to excite no suspicion in these surroundings,
and although I considered that my acquaintance had imbibed more than
enough for one night, I let him have his own way in order that I might
learn the story which he seemed disposed to confide in me. Settled in
the corner of the beerhouse--which chanced to be nearly empty--with
portentous pewters before us, the conversation was opened by my new
friend:

NA

I did not interrupt him.
â€œI was ashore at Suez--we all was, owinâ€™ to a â€˜itch with the canal

I nodded.
NA
NA
Again I nodded, being most anxious to avoid diverting the current of my
friendâ€™s thoughts.

I did not know Greek Jimmyâ€™s, but I thought it unnecessary to mention
the fact.
â€œIt was just about this time on a steaminâ€™ â€˜ot night as I come out of
Jimmyâ€™s and started for the ship. I was walkinâ€™ along the Waghorn Quay,
same as I might be walkinâ€™ along to-night, all by myself--bit of a
list to port but nothing much--full oâ€™ joy anâ€™ happiness, â€˜appy anâ€™
free--â€˜appy anâ€™ free. Just like you might have noticed to-night, I
noticed a knot of Chinks scrappinâ€™ on the ground all amongst the dust
right in front of me. I rammed in, windmillinâ€™ all round and knocking
â€˜em down like skittles. Seemed to me there was about ten of â€˜em, but

At that, without more ado, he thrust his hand deep into some concealed
pocket and jerked out a Chinese pigtail, which had been severed,
apparently some three inches from the scalp, by a clean cut. My

parts, but, whether elaborate or comparatively simple, that the story

My suspicions vanished; my interest arose to boiling point. I refilled
my acquaintanceâ€™s mug, pressed a sovereign upon him (in honesty I must
confess that he was loath to take it), and departed with the pigtail
coiled neatly in an inner pocket of my jacket. I entered the house in
Wade Street by the side door, and half an hour later let myself out by
the front door, having cast off my dockland disguise.
II
HOW I LOST IT
It was not until the following evening that I found leisure to examine
my strange acquisition, for affairs of more immediate importance
engrossed my attention. But at about ten oâ€™clock I seated myself at
my table, lighted the lamp, and taking out the pigtail from the table
drawer, placed it on the blotting-pad and began to examine it with the
greatest curiosity, for few Chinese affect the pigtail nowadays.
I had scarcely commenced my examination, however, when it was
dramatically interrupted. The door bell commenced to ring jerkily. I
stood up, and as I did so the ringing ceased and in its place came a
muffled beating on the door. I hurried into the passage as the bell
commenced ringing again, and I had almost reached the door when once
more the ringing ceased; but now I could hear a womanâ€™s voice, low but
agitated:
NA
Completely mystified, and not a little alarmed, I threw open the door,
and in there staggered a woman heavily veiled, so that I could see
little of her features, but by the lines of her figure I judged her to
be young.
Uttering a sort of moan of terror she herself closed the door, and
stood with her back to it, watching me through the thick veil, while her
breast rose and fell tumultuously.
NA
I think I may say with justice that I had never been so surprised in my
life; every particular of the incident marked it as unique--set it apart
from the episodes of everyday life.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
suggested.
My strange visitor nodded, without speaking, and I conducted her to the
study which I had just left, and placed the most comfortable arm-chair
close beside the table so that as I sat I might study this woman who
so strangely had burst in upon me. I even tilted the shaded lamp,
artlessly, a trick I had learned from Harley, in order that the light
might fall upon her face.
She may have detected this device; I know not; but as if in answer to
its challenge, she raised her gloved hands and unfastened the heavy veil
which had concealed her features.
Thereupon I found myself looking into a pair of lustrous black eyes
whose almond shape was that of the Orient; I found myself looking at a
woman who, since she was evidently a Jewess, was probably no older than
eighteen or nineteen, but whose beauty was ripely voluptuous, who might
fittingly have posed for Salome, who, despite her modern fashionable
garments, at once suggested to my mind the wanton beauty of the daughter
of Herodias.
I stared at her silently for a time, and presently her full lips parted
in a slow smile. My ideas were diverted into another channel.
NA

My visitor seemed to recollect her fright--or the necessity for
simulation. The pupils of her fine eyes seemed to grow larger and
darker; she pressed her white teeth into her lower lips, and resting her
hands upon the table leaned toward me.

She clutched my arm in the darkness.

Suiting the action to the word, I peered down into the court below. It
was quite deserted. The night was a very dark one, and there were many
patches of shadow in which a man might have lain concealed.
NA
relighting the lamp, â€œif I call a cab for you and see you safely into

She clung to my arm very tightly as we descended the stairs, and often
glanced back over her shoulder affrightedly, as we crossed the court.
There was not a sign of anyone about, however, and I could not make
up my mind whether the story of the yellow man was a delusion or a
fabrication. I inclined to the latter theory, but the object of such a
deception was more difficult to determine.
Sure enough, a taxicab was waiting at the entrance to the court; and my
visitor, having seated herself within, extended her hand to me, and even
through the thick veil I could detect her brilliant smile.
NA
NA
The cab drove off. For a moment I stood looking after it, in a state of
dreamy incertitude, then turned and slowly retraced my steps. Reopening
the door of my chambers with my key, I returned to my study and sat down
at the table to endeavour to arrange the facts of what I recognized to
be a really amazing episode. The adventure, trifling though it seemed,
undoubtedly held some hidden significance that at present was not
apparent to me. In accordance with the excellent custom of my friend,
Paul Harley, I prepared to make notes of the occurrence while the facts
were still fresh in my memory. At the moment that I was about to begin,
I made an astounding discovery.
Although I had been absent only a few minutes, and had locked my door
behind me, the pigtail was gone!
I sat quite still, listening intently. The womanâ€™s story of the yellow
man on the stairs suddenly assumed a totally different aspect--a new and
sinister aspect. Could it be that the pigtail was at the bottom of the
mystery?--could it be that some murderous Chinaman who had been lurking
in hiding, waiting his opportunity, had in some way gained access to my
chambers during that brief absence? If so, was he gone?
From the table drawer I took out a revolver, ascertained that it was
fully loaded, and turning up light after light as I proceeded, conducted
a room-to-room search. It was without result; there was absolutely
nothing to indicate that anyone had surreptitiously entered or departed
from my chambers.
I returned to the study and sat gazing at the revolver lying on the
blotting-pad before me. Perhaps my mind worked slowly, but I think that
fully fifteen minutes must have passed before it dawned on me that the
explanation not only of the missing pigtail but of the other incidents
of the night, was simple enough. The yellow man had been a fabrication,
NA
in quest of the pigtail: and her quest had been successful!
NA
NA
My door bell rang. I sprang nervously to my feet, glanced at the
revolver on the table--and finally dropped it into my coat pocket ere
going out and opening the door.
On the landing stood a police constable and an officer in plain clothes.
NA
note-book which he held in his hand.
NA
â€œYou are required to come at once to Bow Street to identify a woman
who was found murdered in a taxi-cab in the Strand about eleven oâ€™clock
NA
I suppressed an exclamation of horror; I felt myself turning pale.
NA
â€œThe driver stated she came from your chambers, for you saw her off, and
her last words to you were â€˜Good night, Mr. Knox, I am sincerely sorry
NA
The constable, who had read out the information in an official voice,
now looked at me, as I stood there stupefied.
NA
misjudged my unfortunate visitor: her story of the yellow man on the
stair had apparently been not a fabrication, but a gruesome fact!
III
HOW I REGAINED IT
My ghastly duty was performed; I had identified the dreadful thing,
which less than an hour before had been a strikingly beautiful woman,
as my mysterious visitor. The police were palpably disappointed at the
sparsity of my knowledge respecting her. In fact, had it not chanced
that Detective Sergeant Durham was in the station, I think they would
have doubted the accuracy of my story.
As a man of some experience in such matters, I fully recognized its
improbability, but beyond relating the circumstances leading up to my
possession of the pigtail and the events which had ensued, I could do
no more in the matter. The weird relic had not been found on the dead
woman, nor in the cab.
Now the unsavoury business was finished, and I walked along Bow Street,
racking my mind for the master-key to this mystery in which I was become
enmeshed. How I longed to rush off to Harleyâ€™s rooms in Chancery Lane
and to tell him the whole story! But my friend was a thousand miles
away--and I had to see the thing out alone.
That the pigtail was some sacred relic stolen from a Chinese temple and
sought for by its fanatical custodians was a theory which persistently
intruded itself. But I could find no place in that hypothesis for the
beautiful Jewess; and that she was intimately concerned I did not doubt.
A cool survey of the facts rendered it fairly evident that it was she
and none other who had stolen the pigtail from my rooms. Some third
NA
stolen it from her, strangling her in the process.
The police theory of the murder (and I was prepared to accept it) was
that the assassin had been crouching in hiding behind or beside the
cab--or even within the dark interior. He had leaped in and attacked the
woman at the moment that the taxi-man had started his engine; if already
inside, the deed had proven even easier. Then, during some block in the
traffic, he had slipped out unseen, leaving the body of the victim to be
discovered when the cab pulled up at the hotel.
I knew of only one place in London where I might hope to obtain useful
information, and for that place I was making now. It was Malay Jackâ€™s,
whence I had been bound on the previous night when my strange meeting
with the seaman who then possessed the pigtail had led to a change of
plan. The scum of the Asiatic population always come at one time or
another to Jackâ€™s, and I hoped by dint of a little patience to achieve
what the police had now apparently despaired of achieving--the discovery
of the assassin.
Having called at my chambers to obtain my revolver, I mounted an
eastward-bound motor-bus. The night, as I have already stated, was
exceptionally dark. There was no moon, and heavy clouds were spread over
the sky; so that the deserted East End streets presented a sufficiently
uninviting aspect, but one with which I was by no means unfamiliar and
which certainly in no way daunted me.
Changing at Paul Harleyâ€™s Chinatown base in Wade Street, I turned my
steps in the same direction as upon the preceding night; but if my
own will played no part in the matter, then decidedly Providence
truly guided me. Poetic justice is rare enough in real life, yet I was
destined to-night to witness swift retribution overtaking a malefactor.
The by-ways which I had trodden were utterly deserted; I was far from
the lighted high road, and the only signs of human activity that reached
me came from the adjacent river; therefore, when presently an outcry
arose from somewhere on my left, for a moment I really believed that my
imagination was vividly reproducing the episode of the night before!
A furious scuffle--between a European and an Asiatic--was in progress
not twenty yards away!
Realizing that such was indeed the case, and that I was not the victim
of hallucination, I advanced slowly in the direction of the sounds,
but my footsteps reechoed hollowly from wall to wall of the narrow
passage-way, and my coming brought the conflict to a sudden and dramatic
termination.
NA
NA
 (a sound of furious blows and inarticulate chattering) â€œbut it ainâ€™t
NA
I hurried forward toward the spot where two dim figures were locked in
deadly conflict.
NA
One of the figures collapsed in a heap upon the ground. The other
made off at a lumbering gait along a second and even narrower passage
branching at right angles from that in which the scuffle had taken
place.
The clatter of the heavy sea-boots died away in the distance. I stood
beside the fallen man, looking keenly about to right and left; for an
impression was strong upon me that another than I had been witness of
the scene--that a shadowy form had slunk back furtively at my approach.
But the night gave up no sound in confirmation of this, and I could
detect no sign of any lurker.
I stooped over the Chinaman (for a Chinaman it was) who lay at my feet,
and directed the ray of my pocket-lamp upon his yellow and contorted
countenance. I suppressed a cry of surprise and horror.
Despite the human impossibility referred to by the missing fireman, this
particular Chinaman had joined the shades of his ancestors. I think that
final blow, which had felled him, had brought his shaven skull in
such violent contact with the wall that he had died of the thundering
concussion set up.
Kneeling there and looking into his upturned eyes, I became aware that
my position was not an enviable one, particularly since I felt little
disposed to set the law on the track of the real culprit. For this
man who now lay dead at my feet was doubtless one of the pair who had
attempted the life of the fireman of the Jupiter.
That my seafaring acquaintance had designed to kill the Chinaman I did
not believe, despite his stormy words: the death had been an accident,
and (perhaps my morality was over-broad) I considered the assault to
have been justified.
Now my ideas led me further yet. The dead Chinaman wore a rough blue
coat, and gingerly, for I found the contact repulsive, I inserted
my hand into the inside pocket. Immediately my fingers closed upon a
familiar object--and I stood up, whistling slightly, and dangling in my
left hand the missing pigtail!
Beyond doubt Justice had guided the seamanâ€™s blows. This was the man who
had murdered my dark-eyed visitor!
I stood perfectly still, directing the little white ray of my flashlight
upon the pigtail in my hand. I realized that my position, difficult
before, now was become impossible; the possession of the pigtail
compromised me hopelessly. What should I do?
NA
NA
NA
I whirled about, my heart leaping wildly. Detective-Sergeant Durham was
standing watching me, a grim smile upon his face!
I laughed rather shakily.
NA
NA
The detective advanced and knelt beside the crumpled-up figure on the
ground. He examined it briefly, and then stood up.

to buy the birds the thing fed on. Well, Mr. Knox, Huang Chow was the
biggest dealer in illicit stuff in all the East End--and this battered

I agreed at once, and started off.
Thus a second time my plans were interrupted, for my expedition that
night ultimately led me to Bow Street, whence, after certain formalities
had been observed, I departed for my chambers, the mysterious pigtail
in my pocket. Failing the presence of Durham, the pigtail must have been
retained as evidence, but:
NA
NA
The clock of St. Paulâ€™s was chiming the hour of two when I locked the
door of my chambers and prepared to turn in. The clangour of the final
strokes yet vibrated through the nightâ€™s silence when someone set my own
door bell loudly ringing.
With an exclamation of annoyance I shot back the bolts and threw open
the door.
A Chinaman stood outside upon the mat!
IV
HOW IT ALL ENDED
NA
NA
NA
the light in my study, I admitted the Chinaman and stood facing him
with an expression upon my face which I doubt not was the reverse of
agreeable.
My visitor, who wore a slop-shop suit, also wore a wide-brimmed bowler
hat; now, the set bland smile still upon his yellow face, he removed the
bowler and pointed significantly to his skull.
His pigtail had been severed some three inches from the root!
NA
NA
NA
NA
And thereupon in tolerable pidgin English he unfolded his tale. He
proclaimed his name to be Hi Wing Ho, and his profession that of a
sailor, or so I understood him. While ashore at Suez he had become
embroiled with some drunken seamen: knives had been drawn, and in the
scuffle by some strange accident his pigtail had been severed. He
had escaped from the conflict, badly frightened, and had run a great
distance before he realized his loss. Since Southern Chinamen of his
particular Tong hold their pigtails in the highest regard, he had
instituted inquiries as soon as possible, and had presently learned from
a Chinese member of the crew of the S.S. Jupiter that the precious queue
had fallen into the hands of a fireman on that vessel. He (Hi Wing Ho)
had shipped on the first available steamer bound for England, having in
the meanwhile communicated with his friend on the Jupiter respecting the
recovery of the pigtail.
NA
NA
NA
He arrived at the London docks very shortly after the Jupiter. Indeed,
the crew of the latter vessel had not yet been paid off when Hi Wing
Ho presented himself at the dock gates. He admitted that, finding the
fireman so obdurate, he and his friend Li Ping had resorted to violence,
but he did not seem to recognize me as the person who had frustrated
their designs. Thus far I found his story credible enough, excepting
the accidental severing of the pigtail at Suez, but now it became
wildly improbable, for he would have me believe that Li Ping, or Ah Fu,
obtaining possession of the pigtail (in what manner Hi Wing Ho protested
that he knew not) he sought to hold it to ransom, knowing how highly Hi
Wing Ho valued it.
I glared sternly at the Chinaman, but his impassive countenance served
him well. That he was lying to me I no longer doubted; for Ah Fu could
not have hoped to secure such a price as would justify his committing
murder; furthermore, the presence of the unfortunate Jewess in the case
was not accounted for by the ingenious narrative of Hi Wing Ho. I was
standing staring at him and wondering what course to adopt, when yet
again my restless door-bell clamoured in the silence.
Hi Wing Ho started nervously, exhibiting the first symptoms of alarm
which I had perceived in him. My mind was made up in an instant. I took
my revolver from the drawer and covered him.
NA
He shrank from me, pouring forth voluble protestations.
NA
I clenched my left fist and advanced upon him. He scuttled away with his
odd Chinese gait and threw open the door. Standing before me I saw my
friend Detective Sergeant Durham, and with him a remarkably tall and
very large-boned man whose square-jawed face was deeply tanned and whose
aspect was dourly Scottish.
When the piercing eyes of this stranger rested upon Hi Wing Ho an
expression which I shall never forget entered into them; an expression
coldly murderous. As for the Chinaman, he literally crumpled up.
NA
Taking one long stride he stooped upon the Chinaman, seized him by the
back of the neck as a terrier might seize a rat, and lifted him to his
feet.
NA
NA
NA
releasing his hold upon the neck of Hi Wing Ho.
I took the pigtail from my pocket and dangled it before his eyes.
NA
We entered the room which had been the scene of so many singular
happenings. The detective and I seated ourselves, but the Scotsman,
holding the Chinaman by the neck as though he had been some inanimate
bundle, stood just within the doorway, one of the most gigantic
specimens of manhood I had ever set eyes upon.
NA
NA
While Durham talked, then, we all listened--excepting the Chinaman, who
was past taking an intelligent interest in anything, and who, to judge
from his starting eyes, was being slowly strangled.
NA
the East. He is a buyer for a big firm of diamond merchants, and some
NA
NA
terrier fashion.
NA
theft was a very ingenious one, and the man succeeded in getting away
with his haul. He tried to dispose of the diamond to a certain Isaac
Cohenberg, a Singapore moneylender; but Isaac Cohenberg was the bigger
crook of the two. Hi Wing Ho only escaped from the establishment of
Cohenberg by dint of sandbagging the moneylender, and quitted the town
by a boat which left the same night. On the voyage he was indiscreet
enough to take the diamond from its hiding-place and surreptitiously to
examine it. Another member of the Chinese crew, one Li Ping--otherwise
Ah Fu, the accredited agent of old Huang Chow!--was secretly watching
our friend, and, knowing that he possessed this valuable jewel, he also
learned where he kept it hidden. At Suez Ah Fu attacked Hi Wing Ho and
secured possession of the diamond. It was to secure possession of the
diamond that Ah Fu had gone out East. I donâ€™t doubt it. He employed Hi
Wing Ho--and Hi Wing Ho tried to double on him!
â€œWe are indebted to you, Mr. Knox, for some of the data upon which
we have reconstructed the foregoing and also for the next link in the
narrative. A fireman ashore from the Jupiter intruded upon the scene at
Suez and deprived Ah Fu of the fruits of his labours. Hi Wing Ho seems
to have been badly damaged in the scuffle, but Ah Fu, the more wily of
the two, evidently followed the fireman, and, deserting from his own
NA
While this story was enlightening in some respects, it was mystifying in
others. I did not interrupt, however, for Durham immediately resumed:
â€œThe drama was complicated by the presence of a fourth character--the
daughter of Cohenberg. Realizing that a small fortune had slipped
through his fingers, the old moneylender dispatched his daughter in
pursuit of Hi Wing Ho, having learned upon which vessel the latter had
sailed. He had no difficulty in obtaining this information, for he is in
touch with all the crooks of the town. Had he known that the diamond had
been stolen by an agent of Huang Chow, he would no doubt have hesitated.
Huang Chow has an international reputation.
â€œHowever, his daughter--a girl of great personal beauty--relied upon her
diplomatic gifts to regain possession of the stone, but, poor creature,
she had not counted with Ah Fu, who was evidently watching your chambers
(while Hi Wing Ho, it seems, was assiduously shadowing Ah Fu!). How she
traced the diamond from point to point of its travels we do not know,
and probably never shall know, but she was undeniably clever and
unscrupulous. Poor girl! She came to a dreadful end. Mr. Nicholson,
NA
Now the whole amazing truth burst upon me.
NA
NA
Mr. Nicholson pitched him unceremoniously into a corner of the room, and
taking the pigtail in his huge hand, clumsily unfastened it. Out from
the thick part, some two inches below the point at which it had been cut
from the Chinamanâ€™s head, a great diamond dropped upon the floor!
For perhaps twenty seconds there was perfect silence in my study. No one
stooped to pick the diamond from the floor--the diamond which now had
blood upon it. No one, so far as my sense informed me, stirred. But
when, following those moments of stupefaction, we all looked up--Hi Wing
Ho, like a phantom, had faded from the room!

We had nearly reached the house in Wade Street, Limehouse, which my
friend used as a base for East End operations. The night was dark but
clear, and I thought that presently when dawn came it would bring a
cold, bright morning. There was no moon, and as we passed the lamp and
paused we stood in almost total darkness.
Facing in the direction of the Council School I struck a match. It
revealed my ruffianly looking companion--in whom his nearest friends
must have failed to recognize Mr. Paul Harley of Chancery Lane.
He was glancing furtively back along the street, and when a moment later
we moved on, I too, had detected the presence of a figure stumbling
toward us.
NA
few yards away.
Accordingly we passed the house in which Harley had rooms, and had
proceeded some fifteen paces farther when the man who was following us
stumbled in between Harley and myself, clutching an arm of either. I
scarcely knew what to expect, but was prepared for anything, when:

Harley laughed shortly. I cannot say if he remained suspicious of the
newcomer, but for my own part I had determined after one glance at
the man that he was merely a drunken fireman newly recovered from a
prolonged debauch.

As we approached the street lamp and its light shone upon the haggard
face of the man walking between us, Harley stopped, and:
NA
He suddenly tilted the manâ€™s head upward and peered closely into one of
his eyes. I suppressed a gasp of surprise for I instantly recognized the
fireman of the Jupiter!
NA
NA
he pretended to remove the imaginary stain, and then, turning to me:
NA
His examination of the manâ€™s eyes had evidently satisfied him that our
acquaintance had really been smoking opium.
We paused immediately outside the house for which we had been bound, and
as I had the key I opened the door and the three of us stepped into a
little dark room. Harley closed the door and we stumbled upstairs to a
low first-floor apartment facing the street. There was nothing in its
appointments, as revealed in the light of an oil lamp burning on the
solitary table, to distinguish it from a thousand other such apartments
which may be leased for a few shillings a week in the neighbourhood.
That adjoining might have told a different story, for it more closely
resembled an actorâ€™s dressing-room than a seamanâ€™s lodging; but the door
of this sanctum was kept scrupulously locked.
NA
NA
I walked to a cupboard, as the fireman sank limply down in the chair,
and took out a bottle and three glasses. When the man, who, as I could
now see quite plainly, was suffering from the after effects of opium,
had eagerly gulped the stiff drink which I handed to him, he looked
around with dim, glazed eyes, and:
NA
NA
He fixed his eyes on me for a moment, then raised himself from his seat,
peering narrowly at me across the table.
â€œI seed you before, mate. Gaw, blimey! if you ainâ€™t the bloke wot
I givâ€™d the pigtail to! And wot laid out that blasted Chink as was
NA
I shook hands with him, Harley eyeing me closely the while, in a
manner which told me that his quick brain had already supplied the link
connecting our doped acquaintance with my strange experience during his
absence. At the same time it occurred to me that my fireman friend
did not know that Ah Fu was dead, or he would never have broached the
subject so openly.
NA
â€œItâ€™s all right, mate. I donâ€™t want to â€˜ear no more about blinking

and stared at Harley.

occurred, and then began to reload his pipe: â€œat Malay Jackâ€™s or at

â€œThatâ€™s â€˜im, the old bloke with the big joss. I allers goes to see Ma

He banged a big and dirty hand upon the table.
â€œLast night I see murder done, anâ€™ only that I know they wouldnâ€™t
believe me, Iâ€™d walk across to Limehouse Pâ€™lice Station presently and
NA
Harley, who was seated behind the speaker, glanced at me significantly.
NA

â€œThatâ€™s wot I said--blood! When I woke up this morninâ€™ there was blood

to tell â€˜em Iâ€™ll put you on somethink worth tellinâ€™. Sure the bottleâ€™s
NA
I caught Harleyâ€™s glance and divided the remainder of the whisky evenly
between the three glasses.
NA
NA
He lay back in his chair and from a little tobacco-box began to fill a
short clay pipe.
â€œLook â€˜ere, mates, Iâ€™m soberinâ€™ up, like, after the smoke, anâ€™ I can
see, I can see plain, as nobodyâ€™ll ever believe me. Nobody ever does,
NA
He lighted his pipe, and looking about him in a sort of vaguely
aggressive way:
NA
made up my mind to go and smoke a pipe with old Ma Lorenzo. Round I goes
to Pennyfields, and she donâ€™t seem glad to see me. Thereâ€™s nobody
there only me. Not like the old days when you â€˜ad to book your seat in

He laughed gruffly.
â€œShe didnâ€™t want to let me in at first, said they was watched, that if
a Chink â€˜ad an old pipe wot â€˜ad bâ€™longed to â€˜is grandfather it was good
enough to get â€˜im fined fifty quid. Anyway, me beinâ€™ an old friend she
spread a mat for me and filled me a pipe. I asked after old Kwen Lung,
but, of course, â€˜e was out gamblinâ€™, as usual; so after old Ma Lorenzo
â€˜ad made me comfortable anâ€™ gone out I â€˜ad the place to myself, and
presently I dozed off and forgot all about bloody shipâ€™s bunkers anâ€™
NA
He paused and looked about him defiantly.
NA
NA
At that he twisted violently in his chair and glared across at Harley:
NA
NA
He glared for a while, then addressing his narrative more particularly
to me, he resumed:
â€œIt was a scream wot woke me--a womanâ€™s scream. I didnâ€™t sit up; I
couldnâ€™t. I never felt like it before. It was the same as beinâ€™ buried
alive, I should think. I could see anâ€™ I could â€˜ear, but I couldnâ€™t move
one muscle in my body. Foller me? Anâ€™ wot did I see, mates, anâ€™ wot did

NA
NA

time I ever see â€˜er. It was â€˜er shriek wot â€˜ad reached me, reached me
through the smoke. I donâ€™t take much stock in Chink gals in general, but
this oneâ€™s mother was no Chink, Iâ€™ll swear. She was just as pretty as a
bloominâ€™ ivory doll, anâ€™ as little anâ€™ as white, and that old swine Kwen
NA
Harley was leaning forward in his seat now, intent upon the manâ€™s
story, and although I could not get rid of the idea that our friend
was relating the events of a particularly unpleasant opium dream,
nevertheless I was fascinated by the strange story and by the strange
manner of its telling.
NA
huskily, and with his big dirty hands he strove to illustrate his words.
â€œAnâ€™ that old yellow devil lashed anâ€™ lashed until the poor gal was past
screaminâ€™. She just sunk down on the floor all of a â€˜cap, moaninâ€™ and

â€œMeanwhile, â€˜ereâ€™s me with murder in me â€˜eart lyinâ€™ there watchinâ€™,
anâ€™ I canâ€™t speak, no! I canâ€™t even curse the yellow rat, anâ€™ I canâ€™t

the joss anâ€™ â€˜er blood trickled down on â€˜is gilded feet, old Ma Lorenzo

remember it plain, but wot â€˜appened next ainâ€™t so good anâ€™ clear.

NA
That he was intensely absorbed in the story he revealed by a piece of
bad artistry, very rare in him. He temporarily forgot his dialect. Our
marine friend, however, was too much taken up with his own story to
notice the slip, and:
NA
He suddenly twisted around in his chair.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
itâ€™s all blotted out after that. Somebody come in at the winder, but â€˜oo
it was or wot it was I canâ€™t tell yer, not for fifty quid. When I woke
up, which is about â€˜arf an hour before you see me, Iâ€™m all alone--see?
Thereâ€™s no sign of Kwen Lung nor the gal nor old Ma Lorenzo nor anybody.

â€œThis morninâ€™, in the light of the little oil lamp where old Ma Lorenzo
â€˜ad roasted the pills! Itâ€™s all still anâ€™ quiet anâ€™ I feel more dead

â€˜Bill,â€™ I sez, â€˜put out to sea; youâ€™re amongst Kaffirs, Bill.â€™ It
occurred to me as old Kwen Lung might wonder â€˜ow much I knew. So I beat
it. But when I got in the open air I felt Iâ€™d never make my lodginâ€™s
without a tonic. Thatâ€™s â€˜ow I come to meet you, mates.
â€œListen--Iâ€™m away in the old Seahawk in the morninâ€™, but Iâ€™ll tell you

up, and grasping me by the arm, he drew me across the room where he also

was the sweetest, prettiest little gal as a man ever clapped eyes on.

II
AT KWEN LUNGâ€™S
For fully ten minutes after the fireman had departed Paul Harley sat
staring abstractedly in front of him, his cold pipe between his teeth,
and knowing his moods I intruded no words upon this reverie, until:
NA
NA
NA
NA
Without another word he led the way downstairs and out into the deserted
street. The first gray halftones of dawn were creeping into the sky,
so that the outlines of Limehouse loomed like dim silhouettes about
us. There was abundant evidence in the form of noises, strange and
discordant, that many workers were busy on dock and riverside, but the
streets through which our course lay were almost empty. Sometimes a
furtive shadow would move out of some black gully and fade into a dimly
seen doorway in a manner peculiarly unpleasant and Asiatic. But we met
no palpable pedestrian throughout the journey.
Before the door of a house in Pennyfields which closely resembled that
which we had left in Wade Street, in that it was flatly uninteresting,
dirty and commonplace, we paused. There was no sign of life about the
place and no lights showed at any of the windows, which appeared as
dim cavities--eyeless sockets in the gray face of the building, as dawn
proclaimed the birth of a new day.
Harley seized the knocker and knocked sharply. There was no response,
and he repeated the summons, but again without effect. Thereupon, with a
muttered exclamation, he grasped the knocker a third time and executed a
veritable tattoo upon the door. When this had proceeded for about half a
minute or more:
NA
Harley released the knocker, and, turning to me:
NA
Indeed, even as he warned me, heralded by a creaking of bolts and the
rattling of a chain, the door was opened by a fat, shapeless, half-caste
woman of indefinite age; in whose dark eyes, now sunken in bloated
cheeks, in whose full though drooping lips, and even in the whole
overlaid contour of whose face and figure it was possible to recognize
the traces of former beauty. This was Ma Lorenzo, who for many years had
lived at that address with old Kwen Lung, of whom strange stories were
told in Chinatown.
As Bill Jones, A.B., my friend, Paul Harley, was well known to Ma
Lorenzo as he was well known to many others in that strange colony which
clusters round the London docks. I sometimes enjoyed the privilege of
accompanying my friend on a tour of investigation through the weird
resorts which abound in that neighbourhood, and, indeed, we had been
returning from one of these Baghdad nights when our present adventure
had been thrust upon us. Assuming a wild and boisterous manner which he
had at command:
NA
introduce my pal Jim â€˜ere to old Kwen Lung, and make it all right for
NA
Ma Lorenzo, who was half Portuguese, replied in her peculiar accent:
NA
But Harley, brushing past her, was already inside the stuffy little
room, and I hastened to follow.
NA
NA
NA
us.
It was curious to note how long association with the Chinese had
resulted in her catching the infection of that pidgin-English which is a
sort of esperanto in all Asiatic quarters.
NA
and stumbling down three worn steps into a very evil-smelling room.
NA
NA
Ma Lorenzo, having relocked the street door, had rejoined us, and as I
followed my friend down into the dim and uninviting apartment she stood
at the top of the steps, hands on hips, regarding us.
The place, which was quite palpably an opium den, must have disappointed
anyone familiar with the more ornate houses of Chinese vice in San
Francisco and elsewhere. The bare floor was not particularly clean, and
the few decorations which the room boasted were garishly European for
the most part. A deep divan, evidently used sometimes as a bed, occupied
one side of the room, and just to the left of the steps reposed the only
typically Oriental object in the place.
It was a strange thing to see in so sordid a setting; a great gilded
joss, more than life-size, squatting, hideous, upon a massive pedestal;
a figure fit for some native temple but strangely out of place in that
dirty little Limehouse abode.
I had never before visited Kwen Lungâ€™s, but the fame of his golden joss
had reached me, and I know that he had received many offers for it, all
of which he had rejected. It was whispered that Kwen Lung was rich,
that he was a great man among the Chinese, and even that some kind of
religious ceremony periodically took place in his house. Now, as I stood
staring at the famous idol, I saw something which made me stare harder
than ever.
The place was lighted by a hanging lamp from which depended bits of
coloured paper and several gilded silk tassels; but dim as the light was
it could not conceal those tell-tale stains.
There was blood on the feet of the golden idol!
All this I detected at a glance, but ere I had time to speak:
NA
NA
The woman shrugged her fat shoulders.
NA
But as I turned to her, beneath the nonchalant manner I could detect a
great uneasiness; and in her dark eyes there was fear. That Harley also
had seen the bloodstains I was well aware, and I did not doubt that
furthermore he had noted the fact that the only mat which the room
boasted had been placed before the joss--doubtless to hide other stains
upon the boards.
As we stood so I presently became aware of a current of air passing
across the room in the direction of the open door. It came from a window
before which a tawdry red curtain had been draped. Either the window
behind the curtain was wide open, which is alien to Chinese habits,
or it was shattered. While I was wondering if Harley intended to
investigate further:
NA
NA
He turned to the woman:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Grasping me by the arm he lurched up the steps, and the two of us
presently found ourselves out in the street again. In the growing
light the squalor of the district was more evident than ever, but the
comparative freshness of the air was welcome after the reek of that room
in which the golden idol sat leering, with blood at his feet.
NA
NA
Harley nodded shortly.
NA
NA
As we hurried along:
NA
â€œFirst step: search Kwen Lungâ€™s house from cellar to roof. Second step:
entirely dependent upon result of first. The Chinese are subtle, Knox.
If Kwen Lung has killed his daughter, it may require all the resources
NA
NA
â€œThere is no â€˜butâ€™ about it. Chinatown is the one district of London
NA
III
NA
Half an hour later, as I sat in the inner room before the great
dressing-table laboriously removing my disguise--for I was utterly
incapable of metamorphosing myself like Harley in seven minutes--I
heard a rapping at the outer door. I glanced nervously at my face in the
mirror.
NA
precious to my friend I had acted as his dresser before setting to work
to remove my own make-up. There were two entrances to the establishment,
by one of which Paul Harley invariably entered and invariably went out,
NA
but never Paul Harley. That my friend had made good his retirement I
knew, but, nevertheless, if I had to open the door of the outer room it
NA
Thinking it impolite not to do so, since the one who knocked might be
aware that we had come in but not gone out again, I hastily readjusted
that side of my moustache which I had begun to remove, replaced my
cap and muffler, and carefully locking the door of the dressing-room,
crossed the outer apartment and opened the door.
It was Harleyâ€™s custom never to enter or leave these rooms except under
the mantle of friendly night, but at so early an hour I confess I had
not expected a visitor. Wondering whom I should find there I opened the
door.
Standing on the landing was a fellow-lodger who permanently occupied
the two top rooms of the house. Paul Harley had taken the trouble to
NA
known in the saloons and worse resorts which he frequented, was palpably
a broken-down gentleman; a piece of flotsam caught in the yellow stream.
Opium had been his downfall. How he lived I never knew, but Harley
believed he had some small but settled income, sufficient to enable him
to kill himself in comfort with the black pills.
As he stood there before me in the early morning light, I was aware of
some subtle change in his appearance. It was fully six months since I
had seen him last, but in some vague way he looked younger. Haggard
he was, with an ugly cut showing on his temple, but not so lined as
I remembered him. Some former man seemed to be struggling through the
opium-scarred surface. His eyes were brighter, and I noted with surprise
that he wore decent clothes and was clean shaved.
NA
As he spoke I observed, too, that his manner had altered. He who had
consorted with the sweepings af the doss-houses now addressed me as
a courteous gentleman addresses an inferior--not haughtily or
patronizingly, but with a note of conscious superiority and self-respect
wholly unfamiliar. Almost it threw me off my guard, but remembering in
NA
NA
NA
I placed for him the arm-chair which our friend the fireman had so
recently occupied, but:
NA
And now I observed that he was evidently in a condition of repressed
excitement. Perhaps he saw the curiosity in my glance, for he suddenly
rested both his hands on my shoulders, and:
NA
Thereâ€™s not a soul in this neighbourhood I can trust, yet if ever a man
wanted a pal, I want one to-day. Now, youâ€™re square, my lad. I always
knew that, in spite of the dope; and if I ask you to do a little thing
NA
NA
â€œThen, listen. Iâ€™m leaving England in the Patna for Singapore. She sails
at noon to-morrow, and passengers go on board at ten oâ€™clock. Iâ€™ve got

NA
I stared him in the face.
NA
He returned my look with one searching and eager; then:
NA
will you go down to the dock--itâ€™s no great distance--and ask to see
NA
NA
â€œNever mind. When you give him a letter which I shall write he will make
the necessary arrangements for me to occupy my state-room to-night. I
NA
NA
NA
We shook hands heartily, and:
NA
Turning, he led the way upstairs to his own room, and wondering greatly,
I followed him in. Never having been in Captain Danâ€™s apartments I
cannot say whether they, like their occupant, had changed for the
better. But I found myself in a room surprisingly clean and with a note
of culture in its appointments which was even more surprising.
On a couch by the window, wrapped in a fur rug, lay the prettiest
half-caste girl I had ever seen, East or West. Her skin was like cream
rose petals and her abundant hair was of wonderful lustrous black.
Perhaps it was her smooth warm colour which suggested the idea, but
as her cheeks flushed at sight of Captain Dan and the long dark eyes
lighted up in welcome, I thought of a delicate painting on ivory and I
wondered more and more what it all could mean.
NA
NA
But even before he had spoken I had seen the girl wince with pain as she
had endeavoured to sit up to greet us. She lay on her side in a rather
constrained attitude, but although her sudden movement had brought tears
to her eyes she smiled bravely and extended a tiny ivory hand to me.
NA
I could find no words at all, but merely stood there looking very
awkward and feeling almost awed by the indescribable expression of trust
in the eyes of the little Eurasian, as with her tiny fingers hidden in
her husbandâ€™s clasp she lay looking up at him.
NA
to-night. My wife is really too ill to travel; in fact, I shall have
to carry her down to the cab, and such a proceeding in daylight would

His wife disengaged her hand and extended it to me.

IV
THE SECRET OF MA LORENZO
It must have been about eleven oâ€™clock that night when Paul Harley rang
me up. Since we had parted in the early morning I had had no word from
him, and I was all anxiety to tell him of the quaint little romance
which unknown to us had had its setting in the room above.
In accordance with my promise I had seen the chief officer of the Patna;
NA
 letter, I judged that Mr. Marryat and the man who for so long had sunk
to the lowest rung of the ladder had been close friends in those â€œold
NA
without a momentâ€™s delay, and the couple were to go on board the Patna
at nine oâ€™clock.
It was with a sense of having done at least one good deed that I finally
quitted our Limehouse base and returned to my rooms. Now, at eleven
oâ€™clock at night:
NA
NA
NA
â€œHardly a development, but Iâ€™m not satisfied, Knox. I hate to be

Twenty minutes later I was sitting in Harleyâ€™s study, watching him
restlessly promenading up and down before the fire.

said. â€œI was there myself. Old Kwen Lung conveniently kept out of the
way--still playing fan-tan, no doubt! But Ma Lorenzo was in evidence.
She blandly declared that Kwen Lung never had a daughter! And in the
absence of our friend the fireman, who sailed in the Seahawk, and whose
evidence, by the way, is legally valueless--what could we do? They could
find nobody in the neighbourhood prepared to state that Kwen Lung had
a daughter or that Kwen Lung had no daughter. There are all sorts of

NA
â€œOf course--and also, of course, I shall be the laughing stock of

It was close on midnight when once more I found myself in Pennyfields.
Carried away by Harleyâ€™s irritable excitement I had quite forgotten the
romance of Captain Dan; and when, having exchanged greetings with the
detective on duty hard by the house of Kwen Lung, we presently found
ourselves in the presence of Ma Lorenzo, I scarcely knew for a moment if
NA
NA
The woman shook her head.
NA
NA
NA
A moment later I found myself again in the room of the golden joss.
The red curtain had been removed from before the shattered window,
but otherwise the place looked exactly as it had looked before. The
atmosphere was much less stale, however, but there was something
repellent about the great gilded idol smiling eternally from his
pedestal beside the door.
I stared into the leering face, and it was the face of one who knew and
who might have said: â€œYes! this and other things equally strange have I
beheld in many lands as well as England. Much I could tell. Many things
grim and terrible, and some few joyous; for behold! I smile but am
NA
For a while Harley stared abstractedly at the bloodstains on the
pedestal of the joss and upon the floor beneath from which the matting
had been pulled back. Suddenly he turned to Ma Lorenzo:
NA
Watching her, I thought I saw the woman flinch, but there was enough
of the Oriental in her composition to save her from self-betrayal. She
shook her head slowly, watching Harley through half-closed eyes.
NA
And I thought for once that her lapse into pidgin had been deliberate
and not accidental.
When finally we quitted the house of the missing Kwen Lung, and when,
NA
duty, we came out into Limehouse Causeway.
NA
womanâ€™s explanation may be true, and that the fireman of the Seahawk may
NA
NA
He was in a particularly impossible mood, for he so rarely made mistakes
that to be detected in one invariably brought out those petulant traits
of character which may have been due in some measure to long residence
in the East. Recognizing that he would rather be alone I parted from
him at the corner of Chancery Lane and returned to my own chambers.
Furthermore, I was very tired, for it was close upon two oâ€™clock, and on
turning in I very promptly went to sleep, nor did I awaken until late in
the morning.
For some odd reason, but possibly because the fact had occurred to me
just as I was retiring, I remembered at the moment of waking that I had
not told Harley about the romantic wedding of Captain Dan. As I had left
my friend in very ill humour I thought that this would be a good excuse
for an early call, and just before eleven oâ€™clock I walked into his
office. Innes, his invaluable secretary, showed me into the study at the
back.
NA
NA
NA
Harley shook his head.
NA
NA
NA
NA
I took up the little image and examined it with interest. It was most
beautifully fashioned in the patient Oriental way, and there was a
little hinged door in the back which fitted so perfectly that when
closed it was quite impossible to detect its presence. I glanced at
Harley.
NA
NA
But even as he uttered the words his whole expression changed, and so
suddenly as to startle me. He sprang up from the table, and:
NA
NA
NA
Four minutes later we were speeding in the direction of Limehouse, and
not a word of explanation to account for this sudden journey could I
extract from my friend. Therefore I beguiled the time by telling him of
my adventure with Captain Dan.
Harley listened to the story in unbroken silence, but at its termination
he brought his hand down sharply on my knee.
NA
NA
I stared at him in amazement, but he merely laughed and offered no
explanation of his words.
Presently, then, I found myself yet again in the familiar room of the
golden joss. Ma Lorenzo, in whom some hidden anxiety seemed to have
increased since I had last seen her, stood at the top of the stairs
watching us. Upon what idea my friend was operating and what he intended
to do I could not imagine; but without a word to the woman he crossed
the room and grasping the great golden idol with both arms he dragged it
forward across the floor!
As he did so there was a stifled shriek, and Ma Lorenzo, stumbling down
the steps, threw herself on her knees before Harley! Raising imploring
hands:
NA
NA
NA
Momentarily she hesitated, and did not rise from her knees, but:
NA
The woman rose unsteadily and walking slowly round the joss manipulated
some hidden fastening, whereupon the entire back of the thing opened
like a door! From what was within she shudderingly averted her face,
but Harley, stepping back against the wall, stopped and peered into the
cavity.
NA
Prepared by his manner for some gruesome spectacle, I obeyed--and from
that which I saw I recoiled in horror.
NA
The spectacle had truly sickened me. Crouched within the narrow space
enclosed by the figure of the idol was the body of an old and wrinkled
Chinaman! His knees were drawn up to his chin, and his head so
compressed upon them that little of his features could be seen.
NA
NA
Such a note of hatred came into her voice as I had never heard in the
voice of any woman.
â€œHe is vile, a demon, a mocking cruel demon! Long, long years ago I
would have killed him, but always I was afraid. I tell you everything,
NA
her voice changed and a note of almost grotesque tenderness came into
it--â€œthe lotus-flower, that is his own daughterâ€™s child, flesh of
his flesh, he keeps a prisoner as the women of China are kept, up
NA
that someone comes to see her--someone who used to come to smoke but who
gave it up because he had looked into the dear oneâ€™s eye. He does not
know that she goes with me to see her man. Ah! we think he does not
know! I--I arrange it all. A week ago they were married. Tuesday night,
NA
Tears now were running down the womanâ€™s fat cheeks, and her voice
quivered emotionally.
â€œFor me it is the end, but for her it is the beginning of life. All
right! I donâ€™t matter a damn! She is young and beautiful. Ah, God! so
beautiful! A drunken pig comes here and finds his way in, so I give him
the smoke and presently he sleeps, but it makes delay, and I donâ€™t know
how soon Kwen Lung, that yellow demon, will wake. For he is like the
bats who sleep all day and wake at night.
â€œAt last the sailor pig sleeps and I call softly to my dear little one
that the time has come. I have gone out into the street, locking
the door behind me, to see if her man is waiting, and I hear her
shrieks--her shrieks! I hurry back. My hands tremble so much that I can
scarcely unlock the door. At last I enter, and I see and I know--that
yellow devil has learned all and has been playing with us like cat and
mouse! He is lashing her, with a great whip! Lashing her--that tiny,
NA
She choked in her utterance, and turning to the gilded joss which
contained the dead Chinaman she shook her clenched hands at it, and the
expression on her face I can never forget. Then:
â€œAs I shriek curses at him, crash goes the window--and I see her husband
spring into the room! The tender one had fallen, there at the foot
of the joss, and Kwen Lung, his teeth gleaming--like a rat--like a
devil--turns to meet him. So he is when her man strike him, once. Just
NA
he coughs. He lie still. For him it is finished. That devil heart has
NA
She threw up her hands, and:
NA
NA
NA
At that Ma Lorenzo slowly raised her head and folded her arms across her
bosom. There was something one could never forget in the expression of
her fat face.
NA
NA
She sank on to the divan and buried her face in her hands. Her fat
shoulders shook grotesquely; and Harley stood perfectly still staring
across at her for fully a minute. I could hear voices in the street
outside and the hum of traffic in Limehouse Causeway.
Then my friend did a singular thing. Walking over to the gilded joss
he reclosed the opening and not without a great effort pushed the great
idol back against the wall.
NA
NA
While I watched him dumfounded he walked across to the woman and touched
her on the shoulder. She raised her tear-stained face.
NA
NA
â€œIâ€™ll have the man removed who is watching the house, and you can reckon
NA
With never another word he seized me by the arm and hurried me out
of the place! Ten paces along the street a shabby-looking fellow was
standing, leaning against a pillar. Harley stopped, and:
NA
â€œIâ€™m throwing up the case; probably Inspector Wessex will do the same.

On towards the Causeway he led me--for not a word was I capable of
uttering; and just before we reached that artery of Chinatown, from
down-river came the deep, sustained note of a steamerâ€™s siren, the
warning of some big liner leaving dock.

MAN WITH THE SHAVEN SKULL
I
A STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE
NA
NA
Paul Harley and I bent gingerly over the ghastly exhibit to which
the C.I.D. official had drawn our attention, and to view which we had
journeyed from Chancery Lane to Wapping.
This was the body of a man dressed solely in ragged shirt and trousers.
But the remarkable feature of his appearance lay in the fact that every
scrap of hair from chin, lip, eyebrows and skull had been shaved off!
There was another facial disfigurement, peculiarly and horribly Eastern,
which my pen may not describe.

He indicated three small wounds, one situated on the left shoulder and
the others on the forearm of the dead man.

Detective-Inspector Wessex listened to my companion with respect, for
apart from his established reputation as a private inquiry-agent which
had made his name familiar in nearly every capital of the civilized
world, Paul Harleyâ€™s work in Constantinople during the six months
preceding war with Turkey had merited higher reward than it had ever
received. Had his recommendations been adopted the course of history
must have been materially changed.

Paul Harley nodded to the constable in charge, and the ghastly figure
was promptly covered up again. My friend stood staring vacantly at
Wessex, and presently:
NA
turned, and walked out.

Harleyâ€™s car, which stood at the door, â€œI will, of course, report
to you, Mr. Harley. But in the absence of any clue or mark of
identification, I fear the verdict will be, â€˜Body of a man unknown,â€™
etc., which has marked the finish of a good many in this cheerful

NA
though, and may not end as you suppose. However--where do you want me to
NA

get your opinion on the shaven man. Iâ€™m really going down to Deepbrow to
look into that new disappearance case; the daughter of the gamekeeper.

within the last eight weeks leaving no trace behind, had stimulated the
professional scribes to link the cases, although no visible link had
been found, and to enliven a somewhat dull journalistic season with

The vanishing of this fourth girl had inspired them to some startling
headlines, and the case had interested me personally for the reason that
I was acquainted with Sir Howard Hepwell, one of whose gamekeepers was
the stepfather of the missing Molly Clayton. Moreover, it was hinted
that she had gone away in the company of Captain Ronald Vane, at that
time a guest of Sir Howardâ€™s at the Manor.
In fact, Sir Howard had â€˜phoned to ask me if I could induce Harley to
run down, but my friend had expressed himself as disinterested in a
common case of elopement. Now, as Wessex spoke, I glanced aside at
Harley, wondering if the fact that so celebrated a member of the C.I.D.
as Detective-Inspector Wessex had been put in charge would induce him to
change his mind.
We were traversing a particularly noisy and unsavoury section of the
Commercial Road, and although I could see that Wessex was anxious to
impart particulars of the case to Harley, so loud was the din that I
recognized the impossibility of conversing, and therefore:

Accordingly, we three presently gathered in my chambers, and Wessex,
with one eye on the clock, outlined the few facts at that time in his
possession respecting the missing girl.
Two days before the news of the disappearance had been published
broadcast under such headings as I have already indicated, a significant
scene had been enacted in the gamekeeperâ€™s cottage.
Molly Clayton, a girl whose remarkable beauty had made her a central
figure in numerous scandalous stories, for such is the charity of rural
neighbours, was detected by her stepfather, about eight in the evening,
slipping out of the cottage.

The girl wrenched her arm from Bramberâ€™s grasp, and blazed defiance from
her beautiful eyes.
NA
NA
NA
Snatching her hat, the girl, very white, made to go out. Whereat the
gamekeeper, a brutal man with small love for Molly, and maddened by her
taking him at his word, seized her suddenly by her abundant fair hair
and hauled her back into the room.
A violent scene followed, at the end of which Molly fainted and Bramber
came out and locked the door.
When he came back about half-past nine the girl was missing. She did not
reappear that night, and the police were advised in the morning. Their
most significant discovery was this:
Captain Ronald Vane, on the night of Mollyâ€™s disappearance, had left
the Manor House, after dining alone with his host, Sir Howard Hepwell,
saying that he proposed to take a stroll as far as the Deep Wood.
He never returned!
From the moment that Gamekeeper Bramber left his cottage, and the moment
when Sir Howard Hepwell parted from his guest after dinner, the world to
which these two people, Molly Clayton and Captain Vane, were known, knew
them no more!
I was about to say that they were never seen again. But to me has fallen
the task of relating how and where Paul Harley and I met with Captain
Vane and Molly Clayton.

Leaving Sir Howard at the Manor, we had joined Inspector Wessex at a
spot where the baronetâ€™s preserves bordered a narrow lane. Here the
ground was soft, and the detective drew Harleyâ€™s attention to a number

Harley dropped to his knees and made a brief but close examination of
the ground round about. One particularly clear imprint of a pointed toe
he noticed especially; and Wessex, diving into the pocket of his light
overcoat, produced a patent-leather shoe, such as is used for evening
wear.

NA
NA
NA
Where the tracks of the tires were visible we stopped, and Harley made a
careful examination of the marks.
NA
NA
Harley crawled about on the ground for some time, to the great detriment
of his Harris tweeds, but finally arose, a curious expression on his
face--which, however, the detective evidently failed to observe.
We returned to the Manor House where Sir Howard was awaiting us, his
good-humoured red face more red than usual; and in the library, with
its sporting prints and its works for the most part dealing with riding,
hunting, racing, and golf (except for a sprinkling of Nat Gouldâ€™s novels
and some examples of the older workmanship of Whyte-Melville), we were
presently comfortably ensconced. On a side table were placed a generous
supply of liquid refreshments, cigars and cigarettes; so that we made
ourselves quite comfortable, and Sir Howard restrained his indignation,
until each had a glass before him and all were smoking.
NA
NA

want to hear one thing; that you expect to trace the disgraceful couple.

me--the outrage inflicted upon my hospitality by this dirty guest of

As a result, Harley and I presently set out for the gamekeeperâ€™s
cottage, and as the man had been warned that we should visit him, he was
on the porch smoking his pipe. A big, dark, ugly fellow he proved to be,
of a very forbidding cast of countenance. Having introduced ourselves:

Leaving Bramber to digest this rebuke, we came out of the cottage. Dusk
was falling now, and by the time that we regained the Manor the place
was lighted up. Inspector Wessex was waiting for us in the library, and:

The blue eyes of the baronet gleamed with the simple cunning of his
kind.

Inspector Wessex looked at me significantly, but I could only shrug my
shoulders in reply; for in these moods Harley was as inscrutable as the
Sphinx.
However, he had his way, and Sir Howard hurriedly putting a car in
commission, we raced for the local station and just succeeded in picking
up the express at Claybury.
Wessex was rather silent throughout the journey, often glancing in my
friendâ€™s direction, but Harley made no further reference to the case
beyond outlining the interview with Bramber, until, as we were parting
at the London terminus, Wessex to report to Scotland Yard and I to go to
Harleyâ€™s rooms:

up, and:

Knowing that Harley did not lightly make such an assertion, I put aside
the work upon which I was engaged and hurried around to Chancery Lane.
I found my friend, pipe in mouth, walking up and down his smoke-laden
study in a state which I knew to betoken suppressed excitement, and:
NA
NA
further anticipated he did a number of copies of the picture for the
NA
NA

queer smile stealing across his tanned, clean-shaven face.

NA
He continued to stare at me and I to stare at the piece of silk; then:
NA
NA
NA
ourselves look as much like a couple of Oriental commercial travellers
NA
NA
NA
NA
Twenty minutes later, then, having quitted Harleyâ€™s chambers by a back
way opening into one of those old-world courts which abound in this part
of the metropolis, two quietly attired Eastern gentlemen got into a
cab at the corner of Chancery Lane and proceeded in the direction of
Limehouse.
There are haunts in many parts of London whose very existence is
unsuspected by all but the few; haunts unvisited by the tourist and
even unknown to the copy-hunting pressman. Into a quiet thoroughfare not
three minutesâ€™ walk from the busy life of West India Dock Road, Harley
led the way. Before a door sandwiched in between the entrance to a Greek
tobacconistâ€™s establishment and a boarded shop-front, he paused and
turned to me.
NA
NA
He rang the bell beside the door, and almost immediately it was opened
by a Negress, grossly and repellently ugly.
Harley pattered something in what sounded like Arabic, whereat the
Negress displayed the utmost servility, ushering us into an ill-lighted
passage with every evidence of respect. Following this passage to its
termination, an inner door was opened, and a burst of discordant music
greeted us, together with a wave of tobacco smoke. We entered.
Despite my friendâ€™s particular injunctions to the contrary I gave a
start of amazement.
We stood in the doorway of a fairly large apartment having a divan round
three of its sides. This divan was occupied by ten or a dozen men of
mixed nationalities--Arabs, Greeks, lascars, and others. They smoked
cigarettes for the most part and sipped Mokha from little cups. A girl
was performing a wriggling dance upon the square carpet occupying the
centre of the floor, accompanied by a Nubian boy who twanged upon a
guitar, and by most of the assembled company, who clapped their hands to
the music or droned a low, tuneless dirge.
Shortly after our entrance the performance terminated, and the girl
retired through a curtained doorway at the farther end of the room.
Our presence being now observed, suspicious glances were cast in our
direction, and a very aged man, who sat smoking a narghli near the door
by which the girl had made her exit, gravely waved towards us the amber
mouthpiece which he held in his hand.
Harley walked straight across to him, I close at his heels. The light of
a lamp which hung close by fell fully upon my friendâ€™s face; and, rising
from his seat, the old man greeted him with the dignified and graceful
salutation of the East. At his request we seated ourselves beside him,
and, while we all three smoked excellent Turkish cigarettes, Harley and
he conversed in a low tone. Suddenly, at some remark of my friendâ€™s,
our strange host rose to his feet, an angry frown contracting his heavy
eyebrows.
Silence fell upon the company.
In a loud and peremptory voice he called out something in Arabic.
Instantly I detected a fellow near the entrance door, and whom I had not
hitherto observed, slipping furtively into the shadow, with a view, as
I thought, to secret departure. He seemed to be deformed in some way
and had the most evil, pock-marked face I had ever beheld in my life.
Angrily, the majestic old man recalled him. Whereupon, with a sort of
animal snarl quite indescribable, the fellow plucked out a knife! Two
men who had been on the point of seizing him fell back, and:
NA
NA
But Harley was too late. Turning, the strange and formidable-looking
Oriental ran like the wind! Ere hand could be raised to stay him he was
through the doorway!
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
irritably upon his knees. â€œThe place we have just left is a sort of
club, you understand, Knox, and Hakim is the proprietor or host as well
as being an old gentleman of importance and authority in the Moslem
world. I told him of my suspicions--which step I should have taken
earlier--and they were instantly confirmed. My man was there--recognized

NA

IV
THE HOUSE BY THE RIVER
On quitting the singular Oriental club, Harley had first raced off to
a public telephone, where he had spoken for some time--as I now
divined--to Scotland Yard. For when we presently arrived at the
headquarters of the Metropolitan Police, I was surprised to find
Inspector Wessex awaiting us. Leaning out of the cab window:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The Inspector joined us in the cab, having first given instructions to
the chauffeur. As we set out once more:
NA
 continued my friend.
NA
â€œIâ€™m not so sure of it. One of the biggest villains in the civilized
world recognized me three minutes before I called you up and then made

Little more was said from that moment until the end of the drive, both
my companions seeming to be consumed by an intense eagerness to reach
our destination. At last the cab drew up in a deserted street. I had
rather lost my bearings; but I knew that we were once more somewhere in
the Chinatown area, and:
NA
Wessex, â€œand wait out of sight. If you hear me blow this whistle, bring
up the men you have posted--as quick as you like! But make it your
NA
Into a pitch-dark yard we turned, and I felt a shudder of apprehension
upon observing that it was the entrance to a wharf. Dully gleaming in
the moonlight, the Thames, that grave of many a ghastly secret, flowed
beneath us. Emerging from the shadow of the archway, we paused before a
door in the wall on our left.
At that moment something gleamed through the air, whizzed past my ear,
and fell with a metallic jingle on the stones!
Instinctively we both looked up.
At an unlighted window on the first floor I caught a fleeting glimpse of
a dark face.
NA
Harley stooped and picked up a knife with a broad and very curious
blade. He slipped it into his pocket, nonchalantly.
NA
NA
Wondering at his daring, I nevertheless obeyed; and Harley succeeded,
although not without difficulty, in achieving his purpose. A moment
after he had disappeared in the blackness of the room above.
NA
NA
down, and:
NA
It proved no easy task, but I finally managed to scramble up beside my
friend--to find myself in a dark and stuffy little room.
NA
He led the way without more ado, but it was with serious misgivings that
I stumbled up a darkened stair in the rear of my greatly daring friend.
A pistol cracked in the darkness--and my fez was no longer on my head!
Harleyâ€™s repeater answered, and we stumbled through a heavily curtained
door into a heated room, the air of which was laden with some Eastern
perfume. In the dim light from a silken-shaded lantern a figure showed,
momentarily, darting across the place before us.
Again Harleyâ€™s pistol spoke, but, as it seemed, ineffectively.
I had little enough opportunity to survey my surroundings; yet even in
those brief, breathless moments I saw enough of the place wherein we
stood to make me doubt the evidence of my senses! Outside, I knew, lay
a dingy wharf, amid a maze of mean streets; here was an opulently
furnished apartment with a strong Oriental note in the decorations!
Snatching an electric torch from his pocket, Harley leaped through
a doorway draped with rich Persian tapestry, and I came close on his
heels. Outside was darkness. A strong draught met us; and, passing along
a carpeted corridor, we never halted until we came to a room filled with
the weirdest odds and ends, apparently collected from every quarter of
the globe.
Crack!
A bullet flattened itself on the wall behind us!
NA
The ray of the torch suddenly picked out the head and shoulders of a man
who was descending through a trap in the floor! Ere we had time to shoot
he was gone! I saw his brown fingers relax their hold--and a bundle
which he had evidently hoped to take with him was left lying upon the
floor.
Together we ran to the trap and looked down.
Slowly moving tidal water flowed darkly beneath us! For twenty
breathless seconds we watched--but nothing showed upon the surface.
NA
NA
is waiting for anyone who tries to escape from that side of the house.
We are by no means alone in this affair, Knox. But, firstly, what
NA
â€œSomething incriminating when Ali of Cairo dared not stay to face it
out! He would never have deserted this place in the ordinary way. That
fellow who was such a bad shot was left behind, when the news of our
approach reached here, to make a desperate attempt to remove some piece
NA
All the time he was busily removing the pieces of sacking and scraps of
Oriental stuff with which the bundle was fastened; and finally he
drew out a dress-suit, together with the linen, collar, shoes, and
underwear--a complete outfit, in fact--and on top of the whole was a
soft gray felt hat!
Eagerly Harley searched the garments for some name of a maker by which
their owner might be identified. Presently, inside the lining of the
breast pocket, where such a mark is usually found, he discovered the
label of a well-known West End firm.
NA
NA
NA
What is the significance of this discovery to which you seem to attach
NA
NA

NA
NA
â€œWe are dealing with the most cunning knave produced by East or West,
and I donâ€™t mean to let him slip through my fingers if he is in this
house! Nevertheless, Knox, I am submitting you to rather an appalling
risk, I know; for our man is desperate, and if he is still in the place
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Harley nodded, and having listened intently for a few moments, proceeded
again to search the singular apartments of the abode. In each was
evidence of Oriental occupancy; indeed, some of the rooms possessed a
sort of Arabian Nights atmosphere. But no living creature was to be seen
or heard anywhere. It was while the two of us, having examined every
inch of wall, I should think, in the building, were standing staring
rather blankly at each other in the room with the lighted lantern, that
I saw Harleyâ€™s expression change.
NA
NA
Even then the significance of this circumstance was not apparent to me.
But Harley stared critically at an electric switch which was placed on
the immediate right of the door and then up at the silk-shaded lantern
which lighted the room. Crossing, he raised and lowered the switch
rapidly, but the lamp continued to burn uninterruptedly!
NA
Grasping the wooden block to which the switch was attached, he turned it
bodily--and I saw that it was a masked knob; for in the next moment he
had pulled open the narrow section of wall--which proved to be nothing
less than a cunningly fitted door!
A small, dimly lighted apartment was revealed, the Oriental note still
predominant in its appointments, which, however, were few, and which I
scarcely paused to note. For lying upon a mattress in this place was a
pretty, fair-haired girl!
She lay on her side, having one white arm thrown out and resting limply
on the floor, and she seemed to be in a semi-conscious condition, for
although her fine eyes were widely opened, they had a glassy, witless
look, and she was evidently unaware of our presence.

NA

V
THE HAREM AGENCY
Owing to the instrumentality of Paul Harley, the public never learned
that the awful riverside murder called by the Press in reference to
NA
Deepbrow case. It was physically impossible to identify the victim, and
Harley had his own reasons for concealing the truth. The house on the
wharf with its choice Oriental furniture was seized by the police;
but, strange to relate, no arrest was made in connection with this most
gruesome outrage. The man who dropped through the trap had been wounded
by one of Harleyâ€™s shots, and he sank for the last time under the very
eyes of the crew of the police cutter.
It was at a late hour on the night of this concluding tragedy that I
learned the amazing truth underlying the case. Wessex was still at work
in the East End upon the hundred and one formalities which attached to
his office, and Harley and I sat in the study of my friendâ€™s chambers in
Chancery Lane.
NA
The tracks leading to the motor-car. They showed--to anyone not hampered
by a preconceived opinion--that the girl and Vane had not gone on
together (since the manâ€™s footprints proved him to have been running),
but that she had gone first and that he had run after her! Arguments:
(a) He heard the approach of the car; or (b) he heard her call for help.
In fact, it almost immediately became evident to me that someone else
had met her at the end of the lane; probably someone who expected her,
and whom she was going to meet when she, accidentally, encountered Vane!
The captain was not attired for an elopement, and, more significant
still, he said he should stroll to the Deep Wood, and that was where he
did stroll to; for it borders the road at this point!
â€œI had privately ascertained, from the postman, that Molly Clayton
actually received a letter on that morning! This resolved my last doubt.
She was not going to meet Vane on the night of her disappearance.
NA
â€œThe old love! He who some months earlier had had over fifty seductive
pictures of this undoubtedly pretty girl prepared for a purpose of his

â€œWhen the girl saw that they meant to take her away, she no doubt made

but these are clever villains, who leave no clues--except for one who
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThen I will tell you. The turmoil in the East has put wealth and power
into unscrupulous hands. But even before the war there were marts,
Knox--open marts--at which a Negro girl might be purchased for some 30
pounds, and a Circassian for anything from 250 pounds to 500 pounds! Ah!
You stare! But I assure you it was so. Here is the point, though: there
were, and still are, private dealers! Those photographs were circulated
among the nouveaux riches of the East! They were employed in the same
way that any other merchant employs a catalogue. They reached the hands
of many an opulent and abandoned â€˜profiteerâ€™ of Damascus, Stambul--where
you will. Mollyâ€™s picture would be one of many. Remember that hundreds
of pretty girls disappear from their homes--taking the whole of the
world--every year. Clearly, English beauty is popular at the moment!
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI was slow enough to understand it myself, Knox. But once the theory
presented itself I asked Wessex to get into immediate touch with the
valet he had already interviewed at Deepbrow. It was the result of his
inquiry to which he referred when we met him at Scotland Yard to-night.
Captain Vane had a large mole on his shoulder and a girlâ€™s name,
together with a small device, tattooed on his forearm--a freak of his

NA
Innesâ€™s smile developed into a laugh, in which Harley joined, then:
NA
Into the study where Harley and I had been seated quietly smoking, there
presently strode a very choleric Anglo-Indian. He wore a horsy check
suit and white spats, and his tie closely resembled a stock. In his
hand he carried a heavy malacca cane, gloves, and one of those tall,
light-gray hats commonly termed white. He was below medium height, slim
and wiry; his gait and the shape of his legs, his build, all proclaimed
the dragoon. His complexion was purple, and the large white teeth
visible beneath a bristling gray moustache added to the natural ferocity
of his appearance. Standing just within the doorway:
NA
It was apparently an inquiry, but it sounded like a reprimand.
My friend, standing before the fireplace, his hands in his pockets and
his pipe in his mouth, nodded brusquely.
NA
Major Ragstaff, glancing angrily at Innes as the latter left the study,
tossed his stick and gloves on to a settee, and drawing up a chair
seated himself stiffly upon it as though he were in a saddle. He stared
straight at Harley, and:
NA

Harley suppressed a smile, and I hastily reached for my cigarette-case
which I had placed upon the mantelshelf.

As Harley spoke the Major glared at him continuously, and then:

He seemed to be temporarily stricken speechless by the discovery that
a man who had acted for the British Government should be capable of
stooping to the work of a private inquiry agent. Staring all about
the room with a sort of naive wonderment, he drew out a big silk
handkerchief and loudly blew his nose, all the time eyeing Harley
questioningly. Replacing his handkerchief he directed his regard upon
me, and:
NA
NA
I rose to depart, but:

He resumed his seat, and taking out his wallet extracted from it a small
newspaper cutting which he offered to Harley.
NA
Harley read as follows:
â€œBefore Mr. Smith, at Marlborough Street Police Court, John Edward
Bampton was charged with assaulting a well-known clubman in Bond Street
on Wednesday evening. It was proved by the constable who made the
arrest that robbery had not been the motive of the assault, and Bampton
confessed that he bore no grudge against the assailed man, indeed, that
he had never seen him before. He pleaded intoxication, and the police
surgeon testified that although not actually intoxicated, his breath
had smelled strongly of liquor at the time of his arrest. Bamptonâ€™s
employers testified to a hitherto blameless character, and as the charge

Having read the paragraph, Harley glanced at the Major with a puzzled
expression.
NA
NA
NA
From his wallet he took a second newspaper cutting, smaller than the
first, and gummed to a sheet of club notepaper. Harley took it and read
as follows:

The puzzled look on Harleyâ€™s face grew more acute, and the Major watched
him with an expression which I can only describe as one of fierce
enjoyment.
NA

these paragraphs is not apparent, I must confess. The man Bampton would
not appear to be an interesting character, and since no great damage has
been done, his drunken frolic hardly comes within my sphere. Of Mr. De

toward me:

A faint expression of interest began to creep into Harleyâ€™s glance, and:

nose loudly. Harley glanced at me in rather an odd way, and then:

The telephone bell rang.
NA
NA
He turned to me.
NA
NA
Since I was always glad of an opportunity of studying my friendâ€™s
methods I immediately agreed, and ere long, leaving the lights of the
two big hotels behind, our cab was gliding down the long slope which
leads to Waterloo Station. Thence through crowded, slummish high-roads
we made our way via Lambeth to that dismal thoroughfare, Westminster
Bridge Road, with its forbidding, often windowless, houses, and its
peculiar air of desolation.
The house for which we were bound was situated at no great distance from
Kensington Park, and telling the cabman to wait, Harley and I walked
up a narrow, paved path, mounted a flight of steps, and rang the bell
beside a somewhat time-worn door, above which was an old-fashioned
fanlight dimly illuminated from within.
A considerable interval elapsed before the door was opened by a
marvellously untidy servant girl who had apparently been interrupted in
the act of black-leading her face. Partly opening the door, she stared
at us agape, pushing back wisps of hair from her eyes and with every
movement daubing more of some mysterious black substance upon her
countenance.
NA
NA
â€œTell him that two friends of his have called on rather important
NA
NA
NA
Treating us to a long, vacant stare and leaving us standing on the step,
the maid (in whose hand I perceived a greasy fork) shuffled along the
passage and began to mount the stairs. An unmistakable odour of frying
sausages now reached my nostrils. Harley glanced at me quizzically,
but said nothing until the Cinderella came stumbling downstairs again.
Without returning to where we stood:
NA
She disappeared into gloomy depths below as Harley and I, closing the
door behind us, proceeded to avail ourselves of the invitation. There
was very little light on the staircase, but we managed to find our way
to a poorly furnished bed-sitting-room where a small table was spread
for a meal. Beside the table, in a chintz-covered arm-chair, a thick-set
young man was seated smoking a cigarette and having a copy of the Daily
Telegraph upon his knees.
He was a very typical lower middle-class, nothing-in-particular young
man, but there was a certain truculence indicated by his square jaw,
and that sort of self-possession which sometimes accompanies physical
strength was evidenced in his manner as, tossing the paper aside, he
stood up.
NA
NA
Bampton stared, a suspicion of anger in his eyes, then, meeting the
amused glance of my friend, he broke into a smile very pleasing and
humorous. He was a fresh-coloured young fellow with hair inclined to
redness, and smiling he looked very boyish indeed.

Bampton, tossing the end of his cigarette into the grate, nodded grimly.

He spoke the words deliberately, having his eyes fixed upon the otherâ€™s
face; but although Bampton was palpably startled there was no trace of
fear in his straightforward glance. He took a cigarette from the case,
and:
NA
NA
NA
paid you to smash Major Ragstaffâ€™s white hat? Number two: How much did
NA
To these questions I listened in amazement, and my amazement was
evidently shared by Bampton. He had been in the act of lighting his
cigarette, but he allowed the match to burn down nearly to his fingers
and then dropped it with a muttered exclamation in the fire. Finally:
NA
the truth. Provided you assure me that you are not out to make a

Harley laid his card on the table, and:
NA
that anything you care to say will go no further. You may speak freely
before my friend, Mr. Knox. Simply tell me in as few words as possible
NA
NA
reflectively. â€œI was having tea in the Lyonsâ€™ cafe, to which I always
go, last Monday afternoon about four oâ€™clock, when a man sat down facing
NA
NA
â€œHe was a man rather above medium height. I should say about my own
build; dark, going gray. He had a neat moustache and a short beard, and
the look of a man who had travelled a lot. His skin was very tanned,
almost as deeply as yours, Mr. Harley. Not at all the sort of chap
that goes in there as a rule. After a while he made an extraordinary
proposal. At first I thought he was joking, then when I grasped the idea
that he was serious I concluded he was mad. He asked me how much a year
I earned, and I told him Peters and Peters paid me 150 pounds. He said:
NA
As Bampton spoke the words he glanced at us with twinkling eyes, but
although for my own part I was merely amused, Harleyâ€™s expression had
grown very stern.
NA
a fat wallet and counted ten five-pound notes on the table I began to
think seriously about his proposal. Even supposing he was cracked, it
was absolutely money for nothing.
â€œâ€˜Of course,â€™ he said, â€˜youâ€™ll lose your job and you may be arrested,
but youâ€™ll say that you had been out with a few friends and were a
little excited, also that you never could stand white hats. Stick to
that story and the balance of a hundred pounds will reach you on the
following morning.â€™
â€œI asked him for further particulars, and I asked him why he had picked
me for the job. He replied that he had been looking for some time for
the right man; a man who was strong enough physically to accomplish the
NA
devil in him, but at the same time a man who could be relied upon to
stick to his guns and not to give the game away.
â€œYou asked me to be brief, and Iâ€™ll try to be. The man in the white hat
was described to me, and the exact time and place of the meeting. I just
had to grab his white hat, smash it, and face the music. I agreed. I
donâ€™t deny that I had a couple of stiff drinks before I set out, but the
memory of that fifty pounds locked up here in my room and the further
hundred promised, bucked me up wonderfully. It was impossible to mistake
my man; I could see him coming toward me as I waited just outside a sort
of little restaurant called the Cafe Dame. As arranged, I bumped into
NA
He paused, raising his hand to his head reminiscently.
NA
Iâ€™ve never heard such language in my life, and the way he laid about me
with his cane is something I am not likely to forget in a hurry. A crowd
gathered, naturally, and (also naturally) I was â€˜pinched.â€™ That didnâ€™t
matter much. I got off lightly; and although Iâ€™ve been dismissed by
Peters and Peters, twenty crisp fivers are locked in my trunk there,
NA
Harley checked him, and:
NA
NA
NA
â€œIt was an ordinary common envelope, posted in the City, address
NA
NA
NA
Bampton stood looking at us with a curious expression on his face, and
suddenly:
NA
know about that poor devil who fell out of a window? Well, it would
never have happened if I hadnâ€™t kicked up a row in the street. Thereâ€™s
no doubt he was leaning out to see what the disturbance was about when
NA
NA
â€œNo. He fell from a window several yards behind me in the side street,
but I heard him cry out, and as I was lugged off by the police I heard

He paused again and stood rubbing his head ruefully.
NA
NA
Bampton reflected silently for some moments, and then:
NA
top-coat, a dark tweed suit, and what looked like a regimental tie, but
I didnâ€™t see much of the colours. He was very tanned, as I have said,
even to the backs of his hands--and oh, yes! there was one point: He had

NA
â€œI canâ€™t remember, except that it was on the left side, and I always

NA
NA
NA
â€œNo. Just a heavy, drawling manner. He spoke like thousands of other
cultured Englishmen. But wait a minute--yes! There was one other point.
NA
Harley stared.

Harley nodded briskly and buttoned up his overcoat.

place to that of something burning--probably the sausages:

III
A CRIMINAL GENIUS
On entering the doorway of the Cafe Dame we found ourselves in a
narrow passage. In front of us was a carpeted stair, and to the right
a glass-panelled door communicating with a discreetly lighted little
dining room which seemed to be well patronized. Opening the door Harley
beckoned to a waiter, and:
NA
NA
NA
NA
The waiter hurried away, and Harley stood glancing up the stairs as if
in doubt what to do.
NA
NA
But even before he ceased speaking I became aware of an excited
conversation which was taking place in some apartment above.
NA
right to keep it! Itâ€™s not your property, and Iâ€™m here to demand that
NA
A manâ€™s voice replied in voluble broken English, but I could only
distinguish a word here and there. I saw that Harley was interested,
for catching my questioning glance, he raised his finger to his lips
enjoining me to be silent.
NA
NA
A flow of unintelligible words answered this speech, then:
NA
NA
NA
her! Iâ€™m afraid you will bungle the business, and I would not ask you to
NA
As a matter of fact, his sudden request had positively astounded me,
but ere I had time for any reply a door suddenly banged open above and
a respectable-looking woman, who might have been some kind of upper
servant, came quickly down the stairs. An expression of intense
indignation rested upon her face, and without seeming to notice our
presence she brushed past us and went out into the street.
NA
Seeing myself committed to an unpleasant business, I slipped out of the
doorway and detected the woman five or six yards away hurrying in the
direction of Piccadilly. I had no difficulty in following her, for
she was evidently unsuspicious of my presence, and when presently she
mounted a westward-bound â€˜bus I did likewise, but while she got inside I
went on top, and occupied a seat on the near side whence I could observe
anyone leaving the vehicle.
If I had not known Paul Harley so well I should have counted the whole
business a ridiculous farce, but recognizing that something underlay
these seemingly trivial and disconnected episodes, I lighted a cigarette
and resigned myself to circumstance.
At Hyde Park Corner I saw the woman descending, and when presently she
walked up Hamilton Place I was not far behind her. At the door of an
imposing mansion she stopped, and in response to a ring of the bell the
door was opened by a footman, and the woman hurried in. Evidently she
was an inmate of the establishment; and conceiving that my duty was done
when I had noted the number of the house, I retraced my steps to the
corner; and, hailing a taxicab, returned to the Cafe Dame.
On inquiring of the same waiter whom Harley had accosted whether my
friend was there:
NA
NA
NA
Thereupon I mounted the stairs and before a half-open door paused.
Harleyâ€™s voice was audible within, and therefore I knocked and entered.
I discovered Harley standing by an American desk. Beside him in
a revolving chair which, with the desk, constituted the principal
furniture of a tiny office, sat a man in a dress-suit which had palpably
not been made for him. He had a sullen and suspiciously Teutonic cast
of countenance, and he was engaged in a voluble but hardly intelligible
speech as I entered.
NA
NA
Harley nodded shortly and turned again to the man in the chair.
NA
NA
At this moment my attention was attracted by a singular object which lay
upon the desk amongst a litter of bills and accounts. This was a piece
of rusty iron bar somewhat less than three feet in length, and which
once had been painted green.

floor Harley whispered in my ear:

Opening a door on the second landing, Mr. Meyer admitted us to a small
supper-room. Its furniture consisted of a round dining table, several
chairs, a couch, and very little else. I observed, however, that the
furniture, carpet, and a few other appointments were of a character
much more elegant than those of the public room below. A window which
overlooked the street was open, so that the plush curtains which had
been drawn aside moved slightly to and fro in the draught.
NA
He crossed the room.
â€œIf you will stand here beside me you will see the gap in the railing
caused by the breaking away of the fragment which now lies on Mr.
Meyerâ€™s desk. Some few yards to the left in the street below is where
the assault took place, of which we have heard, and the unfortunate
Mr. De Lana, who was dining here alone--an eccentric custom of
his--naturally ran to the window upon hearing the disturbance and leaned
out, supporting his weight upon the railing. The rail collapsed, and--we

prominent eyes protruded abnormally. He licked his lips.

â€œExactly; the side entrance. There is something else which I must ask
you to tell me. Who had engaged this room on Tuesday night, the night

and I hear him cry out. The lady comes running from the room and begs of
me to get her away without being seen and to keep all mention of her out

IV
THE SLANTING EYES
NA
NA
NA
Nevertheless, I had forgotten that I was hungry in the excitement which
now claimed me. For although the thread upon which these seemingly
disconnected things hung was invisible to me, I recognized that
Bampton, the city clerk, the bearded stranger who had made so singular
a proposition to him, the white-hatted major, the dead stockbroker,
and the mysterious woman whose presence in the case the clear sight of
Harley had promptly detected, all were linked together by some subtle
chain. I was convinced, too, that my friend held at least one end of
that chain in his grip.
â€œIn order to prepare your mind for the interview which I hope to obtain
NA
points which may seem obscure. In the first place you recognize that
anyone leaning out of the window on the second floor would almost
automatically rest his weight upon the iron bar which was placed there

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou speak of an accident. This was no accident! One end of the bar
had been filed completely through, although the file marks had been
carefully concealed with rust and dirt; and the other end had been
wrenched out from its socket and then replaced in such a way that anyone

â€œI mean, Knox, that the man who occupied the supper room on the night
before the tragedy--the dark man, tanned and bearded, with slightly
oblique eyes---spent his time in filing through that bar--in short, in

I was almost dumbfounded.

I stopped. Suddenly, as if a curtain had been raised, the details of
what I now perceived to be a fiendishly cunning murder were revealed to
me.
NA
regularly passed along that street with military punctuality at the same
hour every night. You may take it for granted that the murderer was well
aware of this. As a matter of fact, I happen to know that he was. We
must also take it for granted that the murderer knew of these little
dinners for two which took place in the private room above the Cafe
Dame every Wednesday--and sometimes on Friday. Around the figure of the
methodical major--with his conspicuous white hat as a sort of focus--was
built up one of the most ingenious schemes of murder with which I have

â€œThat is where I first detected the touch of genius, Knox. He recognized

The cab drew up before the house in Hamilton Place. We alighted, and
Harley pressed the bell. The same footman whom I had seen admit the
woman opened the door.
NA
As he uttered the name I literally held my breath. We had come to the
house of Major Ragstaffâ€™s daughter, the Marchioness of Ireton, one of
societyâ€™s most celebrated and beautiful hostesses!--the wife of a peer
famed alike as sportsman, soldier, and scholar.
NA
NA
her that I wish to return to her a handbag which she lost a few days
NA
The man ushered us into an anteroom opening off the lofty and rather
gloomy hall, and as the door closed:
NA
NA
A few moments later we were shown into a charmingly intimate little
boudoir in which Lady Ireton was waiting to receive us. She was a
strikingly handsome brunette, but to-night her face, which normally,
I think, possessed rich colouring, was almost pallid, and there was a
hunted look in her dark eyes which made me wish to be anywhere rather
than where I found myself. Without preamble she rose and addressed
Harley:
NA
imperious courage with which she faced him. â€œYou say you have recovered
NA
Harley bowed, and from the pocket of his greatcoat took out a
silken-tasselled bag.
NA
NA
NA
Without touching her recovered property, Lady Ireton sank slowly
down into the chair from which she had arisen, her gaze fixed as if
hypnotically upon the speaker.
NA
the latter, â€œbut he is as anxious as I am to terminate this painful
interview. I surmise that what occurred on Wednesday night was
this--(correct me if I am wrong): While dining with Mr. De Lana you
heard sounds of altercation in the street below. May I suggest that you

Lady Ireton, still staring straight before her at Harley, inclined her
head in assent.

what was taking place. The next thing you knew was that he had fallen

Lady Ireton shuddered and raised her hands to her face.
NA
NA
Her voice faded into silence, and:
NA
Lady Ireton nodded, and again recovering power of speech:
NA
She shuddered, and her eyes blazed into sudden fierceness. Then,
clenching her hands, she looked aside.
NA
And I would have given much to have been spared the spectacle of this
proud, erring womanâ€™s humiliation. But Paul Harley was scientifically
remorseless. I could detect no pity in his glance.
â€œI would give my life willingly to spare my husband the knowledge of

times I sent my maid to Meyer to recover my bag, but he demanded a price
which even I could not pay. Now it is all discovered, and Harry will

A strange, horribly pathetic look came into the womanâ€™s haunted eyes.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
As we descended the stair to the hall my friend paused and pointed to a
life-sized oil painting by Londonâ€™s most fashionable portrait painter.
It was that of a man in the uniform of a Guards officer, a dark man,
slightly gray at the temples, his face very tanned as if by exposure to
the sun.
NA
 said Harley, â€œLord Ireton appears here without the beard; and as he is
not represented smiling one cannot see the gold tooth. But the painter,
if anything, has accentuated the slanting eyes. You see, the fourth
marquis--the present Lord Iretonâ€™s father--married one of the
world-famous Yen Sun girls, daughters of the mandarin of that name by an

â€œNot within the meaning of the law, Knox. It was a recrudescence

actually after â€˜big gameâ€™). The counsel is not born who could secure

TCHERIAPIN
I
THE ROSE
NA
NA
I held the little object in the palm of my hand, bending forward over
the marble-topped table and looking down at it with deep curiosity. The
babel of tongues so characteristic of Malay Jackâ€™s, and that mingled
odour of stale spirits, greasy humanity, tobacco, cheap perfume, and
opium, which distinguish the establishment faded from my ken. A sense of
loneliness came to me.
Perhaps I should say that it became complete. I had grown conscious of
its approach at the very moment that the cadaverous white-haired man had
addressed me. There was a quality in his steadfast gaze and in his oddly
pitched deep voice which from the first had wrapped me about--as though
he were cloaking me in his queer personality and withdrawing me from the
common plane.
Having stared for some moments at the object in my palm, I touched it
gingerly; whereupon my acquaintance laughed--a short bass laugh.
NA
NA
Thus encouraged, I took the thing up between finger and thumb, and
held it before my eyes. For long enough I looked at it, and looking, my
wonder grew. I thought that here was the most wonderful example of the
lapidaryâ€™s art which I had ever met with, east or west.
It was a tiny pink rose, no larger than the nail of my little finger.
Stalk and leaves were there, and golden pollen lay in its delicate
heart. Each fairy-petal blushed with June fire; the frail leaves were
exquisitely green. Withal it was as hard and unbendable as a thing of
steel.
NA
A powerful lens was passed by my acquaintance. I regarded the rose
through the glass, and thereupon I knew, beyond doubt, that there was
something phenomenal about the gem--if gem it were. I could plainly
trace the veins and texture of every petal.
I suppose I looked somewhat startled. Although, baldly stated, the fact
may not seem calculated to affright, in reality there was something so
weird about this unnatural bloom that I dropped it on the table. As
I did so I uttered an exclamation; for in spite of the strangerâ€™s
assurances on the point, I had by no means overcome my idea of the
thingâ€™s fragility.
NA
NA
He replaced the jewel in his pocket, and when I returned the lens to
him he acknowledged it with a grave inclination of the head. As I
looked into his sunken eyes, in which I thought lay a sort of sardonic
merriment, the fantastic idea flashed through my mind that I had fallen
into the clutches of an expert hypnotist who was amusing himself at my
expense, that the miniature rose was a mere hallucination produced by
the same means as the notorious Indian rope trick.
Then, looking around me at the cosmopolitan groups surrounding the many
tables, and catching snatches of conversations dealing with subjects
so diverse as the quality of whisky in Singapore, the frail beauty
NA
reasserted itself.
I looked into the gray face of my acquaintance.
NA
so closely duplicate the handiwork of nature. Surely the gem is
unique?--possibly one of those magical talismans of which we read in
NA
My companion smiled.
NA
NA
I was badly puzzled, and doubtless revealed the fact, for the stranger
laughed in his short fashion, and:
NA
hard to believe sometimes that in the present case I hesitate to divulge

This abrupt change of topic somewhat startled me, but nevertheless:

it. You arouse my curiosity intensely. Such a process, with its endless

â€œYou remember also the death of Dr. Kreener, the chief chemist? He died

â€œHe was the inventor of the process, but it was never put upon the

science as some men trifle with love, tossing aside with a smile

â€œYou astound me. Do I understand you to mean that Dr. Kreener had

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
I was now intensely interested. I had not forgotten the heroic death of
the man concerning whose work this chance acquaintance of mine seemed to
know so much. And in the cadaverous face of the stranger as he sat there
regarding me fixedly there was a promise and an allurement. I stood on
the verge of strange things; so that, looking into the deep-set eyes,
once again I felt the cloak being drawn about me, and I resigned myself
willingly to the illusion.
From the moment when he began to speak again until that when I rose and
followed him from Malay Jackâ€™s, as I shall presently relate, I became
oblivious of my surroundings. I lived and moved through those last
fevered hours in the lives of Dr. Kreener, Tcheriapin, the violinist,
and that other tragic figure around whom the story centred. I append:
THE STRANGERâ€™S STORY
I asked you (said the man in the caped coat) if you had ever seen
Tcheriapin, and you replied that you had once heard him play. Having
once heard him play you will not have forgotten him. At that time,
although war still raged, all musical London was asking where he had
come from and to what nation he belonged. Then when he disappeared it
was variously reported, you will recall, that he had been shot as a spy
and that he had escaped from England and was serving with the Austrian
army. As to his parentage I can enlighten you in a measure. He was a
Eurasian. His father was an aristocratic Chinaman, and his mother a
Polish ballet-dancer--that was his parentage; but I would scarcely
hesitate to affirm that he came from Hell; and I shall presently show
you that he has certainly returned there.
You remember the strange stories current about him. The cunning ones
said that he had a clever press agent. This was true enough. One of
the most prominent agents in London discovered him playing in a Paris
cabaret. Two months later he was playing at the Queenâ€™s Hall, and
musical London lay at his feet.
He had something of the personality of Paganini, as you remember, except
that he was a smaller man; long, gaunt, yellowish hands and the face of
a haggard Mephistopheles. The critics quarrelled about him, as critics
only quarrel about real genius, and while one school proclaimed that
Tcheriapin had discovered an entirely new technique, a revolutionary
system of violin playing, another school was equally positive in
declaring that he could not play at all, that he was a mountebank, a
trickster, whose proper place was in a variety theatre.
There were stories, too, that were never published--not only about
Tcheriapin, but concerning the Strad, upon which he played. If all this
atmosphere of mystery which surrounded the man had truly been the work
of a press agent, then the agent must have been as great a genius as
his client. But I can assure you that the stories concerning Tcheriapin,
true and absurd alike, were not inspired for business purposes; they
grew up around him like fungi.
I can see him now, a lean, almost emaciated figure with slow,
sinuous movements and a trick of glancing sideways with those dark,
unfathomable, slightly oblique eyes. He could take up his bow in such a
way as to create an atmosphere of electrical suspense.
He was loathsome, yet fascinating. Oneâ€™s mental attitude toward him was
one of defence, of being tensely on guard. Then he would play.
You have heard him play, and it is therefore unnecessary for me to
attempt to describe the effect of that music. The only composition which
NA
occasion when I heard it, as no other composition has ever done.
Perhaps it was Tcheriapinâ€™s playing rather than the music itself which
reached down into hitherto un-plumbed depths within me and awakened dark
things which, unsuspected, lay there sleeping. I never heard â€œThe Black
NA
published. But had it been we should rarely hear it. Like Lockeâ€™s music
NA
concert programme would be to court disaster. An idle superstition,
perhaps, but there is much naivete in the artistic temperament.
Men detested Tcheriapin, yet when he chose he could win over his
bitterest enemies. Women followed him as children followed the Pied
Piper; he courted none, but was courted by all. He would glance aside
with those black, slanting eyes, shrug in his insolent fashion, and
turn away. And they would follow. God knows how many of them
followed--whether through the dens of Limehouse or the more fashionable
salons of vice in the West End--they followed--perhaps down to Hell. So
much for Tcheriapin.
At the time when the episode occurred to which I have referred, Dr.
Kreener occupied a house in Regentâ€™s Park, to which, when his duties at
the munition works allowed, he would sometimes retire at week-ends.
He was a man of complex personality. I think no one ever knew him
thoroughly; indeed, I doubt if he knew himself.
He was hail-fellow-well-met with the painters, sculptors, poets, and
social reformers who have made of Soho a new Mecca. No movement in
art was so modern that Dr. Kreener was not conversant with it; no
development in Bolshevism so violent or so secret that Dr. Kreener could
not speak of it complacently and with inside knowledge.
These were his Bohemian friends, these dreamers and schemers. Of this
side of his life his scientific colleagues knew little or nothing, but
in his hours of leisure at Regentâ€™s Park it was with these dreamers
that he loved to surround himself rather than with his brethren of the
laboratory. I think if Dr. Kreener had not been a great chemist he would
have been a great painter, or perhaps a politician, or even a poet.
Triumph was his birthright, and the fruits for which lesser men reached
out in vain fell ripe into his hands.
The favourite meeting-place for these oddly assorted boon companions
was the doctorâ€™s laboratory, which was divided from the house by a
moderately large garden. Here on a Sunday evening one might meet the
NA
the man destined to supplant with the ballet the time-worn operatic
tradition.
But while some of these would come and go, so that one could never count
with certainty upon meeting them, there was one who never failed to be
present when such an informal reception was held. Of him I must speak at
greater length, for a reason which will shortly appear.
Andrews was the name by which he was known to the circles in which he
moved. No one, from Sir John Tennier, the fashionable portrait painter,
to Kruski, of the Russian ballet, disputed Andrewsâ€™s right to be counted
one of the elect. Yet it was known, nor did he trouble to hide the fact,
that Andrews was employed at a large printing works in South London,
designing advertisements. He was a great, red-bearded, unkempt Scotsman,
and only once can I remember to have seen him strictly sober; but to
hear him talk about painters and painting in his thick Caledonian accent
was to look into the soul of an artist.
He was as sour as an unripe grape-fruit, cynical, embittered, a man
savagely disappointed with life and the world; and tragedy was written
all over him. If anyone knew the secret of his wasted life it was Dr.
Kreener, and Dr. Kreener was a reliquary of so many secrets that this
one was safe as if the grave had swallowed it.
One Sunday Tcheriapin joined the party. That he would gravitate there
sooner or later was inevitable, for the laboratory in the garden was
a Kaaba to which all such spirits made at least one pilgrimage. He had
just set musical London on fire with his barbaric playing, and already
those stories to which I have referred were creeping into circulation.
Although Dr. Kreener never expected anything of his guests beyond an
interchange of ideas, it was a fact that the laboratory contained
an almost unique collection of pencil and charcoal studies by famous
artists, done upon the spot; of statuettes in wax, putty, soap and other
extemporized materials, by the newest sculptors. While often enough
from the drawing room which opened upon the other end of the garden had
issued the strains of masterly piano-playing, and it was no uncommon
thing for little groups to gather in the neighbouring road to listen,
gratis, to the voice of some great vocalist.
From the first moment of their meeting an intense antagonism sprang up
between Tcheriapin and Andrews. Neither troubled very much to veil it.
In Tcheriapin it found expression in covert sneers and sidelong glances,
while the big, lion-maned Scotsman snorted open contempt of the Eurasian
violinist. However, what I was about to say was that Tcheriapin on the
occasion of his first visit brought his violin.
It was there, amid these incongruous surroundings, that I first had my

There were five of us present, including Tcheriapin, and not one of the
four listeners was unaffected by the music. But the influence which
it exercised upon Andrews was so extraordinary as almost to reach the
phenomenal. He literally writhed in his chair, and finally interrupted
the performance by staggering rather than walking out of the laboratory.
I remember that he upset a jar of acid in his stumbling exit. It flowed
across the floor almost to the feet of Tcheriapin, and the way in which
the little black-haired man skipped, squealing, out of the path of the
corroding fluid was curiously like that of a startled rabbit. Order
was restored in due course, but we could not induce Tcheriapin to
play again, nor did Andrews return until the violinist had taken his
departure. We found him in the dining room, a nearly empty whisky-bottle
beside him.

Tcheriapin revisited Dr. Kreener on many occasions afterward, although
for a long time he did not bring his violin again. The doctor had
prevailed upon Andrews to tolerate the Eurasianâ€™s company, and I could
not help noticing how Tcheriapin skilfully and deliberately goaded the
Scotsman, seeming to take a fiendish delight in disagreeing with his
pet theories and in discussing any topic which he had found to be
distasteful to Andrews.
Chief among these was that sort of irreverent criticism of women in
which male parties so often indulge. Bitter cynic though he was, women
were sacred to Andrews. To speak disrespectfully of a woman in his
presence was like uttering blasphemy in the study of a cardinal.
Tcheriapin very quickly detected the Scotsmanâ€™s weakness, and one night
he launched out into a series of amorous adventures which set Andrews
NA
On this occasion the party was only a small one, comprising myself, Dr.
Kreener, Andrews and Tcheriapin. I could feel the storm brewing, but was
powerless to check it. How presently it was to break in tragic violence
I could not foresee. Fate had not meant that I should foresee it.
Allowing for the free play of an extravagant artistic mind, Tcheriapinâ€™s
career on his own showing had been that of a callous blackguard. I
began by being disgusted and ended by being fascinated, not by the
manâ€™s scandalous adventures, but by the scarcely human psychology of the
narrator.
From Warsaw to Budapesth, Shanghai to Paris, and Cairo to London he
passed, leaving ruin behind him with a smile--airily flicking cigarette
NA
Andrews watched him in a lowering way which I did not like at all. He
had ceased to snort his scorn; indeed, for ten minutes or so he had
uttered no word or sound; but there was something in the pose of his
ungainly body which strangely suggested that of a great dog preparing
to spring. Presently the violinist recalled what he termed a â€œcharming

I shall tell you. Do you remember, my friends, some few years ago, a
picture that was published in Paris and London? Everybody bought it;
NA
NA
NA
As he spoke the words I saw Andrews start forward, and Dr. Kreener
exchanged a swift glance with him. But the Scotsman, unseen by the
vainglorious half-caste, shook his head fiercely.
The picture to which Tcheriapin referred will, of course, be perfectly
familiar to you. It had phenomenal popularity some eight years ago.
Nothing was known of the painter--whose name was Colquhoun--and nothing
has been seen of his work since. The original painting was never sold,
and after a time this promising new artist was, of course, forgotten.
Presently Tcheriapin continued:
â€œIt is the figure of a slender girl--ah! angels of grace!--what a

It is a seashore, you remember, and the little ripples play about
her ankles. The first blush of the dawn robes her white body in a

He paused, rolling his dark eyes; and I could hear Andrewsâ€™s heavy
breathing; then:
â€œIt was the â€˜new artâ€™--the posing of the model not in a lighted studio,
but in the scene to be depicted.
â€œAnd the fellow who painted her!--the man with the barbarous name! Bah!
he was big--as big as our Mr. Andrews--and ugly--pooh! uglier than he!
A moon-face, with cropped skull like a prize-fighter and no soul. But,
yes, he could paint. â€˜A Dream at Dawnâ€™ was genius--yes, some soul he
must have had.
â€œHe could paint, dear friends, but he could not love. Him I counted

He blew imaginary down into space.
â€œHer I sought out, and presently found. She told me, in those sweet
stolen rambles along the shore, when the moonlight made her look like a
Madonna, that she was his inspiration--his art--his life. And she wept;
she wept, and I kissed her tears away.
â€œTo please her I waited until â€˜A Dream at Dawnâ€™ was finished. With the
finish of the picture, finished also his dream of dawn--the moon-faced

Tcheriapin laughed, and lighted a fresh cigarette.
â€œCan you believe that a man could be so stupid? He never knew of
my existence, this big, red booby. He never knew that I existed
until--until his â€˜dreamâ€™ had fled--with me! In a week we were in Paris,
that dream-girl and I--in a month we had quarrelled. I always end these
matters with a quarrel; it makes the complete finish. She struck me in
the face--and I laughed. She turned and went away. We were tired of one
another.

and sweet. I am glad I can remember her so, and not as she afterward

Thus far Tcheriapin had proceeded, and was in the act of airily flicking
ash upon the floor, when, uttering a sound which I can only describe as
a roar, Andrews hurled himself upon the smiling violinist.
His great red hands clutching Tcheriapinâ€™s throat, the insane Scotsman,
for insane he was at that moment, forced the other back upon the settee
from which he had half arisen. In vain I sought to drag him away from
the writhing body, but I doubt that any man could have relaxed that
deadly grip. Tcheriapinâ€™s eyes protruded hideously and his tongue lolled
forth from his mouth. One could hear the breath whistling through his
nostrils as Andrews silently, deliberately, squeezed the life out of
him.
It all occupied only a few minutes, and then Andrews, slowly opening his
rigidly crooked fingers, stood panting and looking down at the distorted
face of the dead man.
For once in his life the Scotsman was sober, and turning to Dr. Kreener:
NA
NA
I can never forget the ensuing moments, in which, amid a horrible
silence broken only by the ticking of a clock and the heavy breathing
of Colquhoun (so long known to us as Andrews) we stood watching the
contorted body on the settee.
And as we watched, slowly the rigid limbs began to relax, and Tcheriapin
slid gently on to the floor, collapsing there with a soft thud, where
he squatted like some hideous Buddha, resting back against the cushions,
one spectral yellow hand upraised, the fingers still clutching a big
gold tassel.
Andrews (for so I always think of him) was seized with a violent fit
of trembling, and he dropped into the chair, muttering to himself and
looking down wild-eyed at his twitching fingers. Then he began to laugh,
high-pitched laughter, in little short peals.
NA
Crossing to Andrews, he grasped him by the shoulders and shook him
roughly.
The laughter ceased, and:
NA
NA
NA
There was a covert meaning in the words--a fact which penetrated even to
the dulled intelligence of the Scotsman, for he glanced up haggardly at
his friend.
NA
Turning, he walked to the laboratory door and locked it. He next lowered
all the blinds.
NA
NA
He mixed a drink for Andrews and himself. His quiet, decisive manner had
had its effect, and Andrews was now more composed. Indeed, he seemed to
be in a half-dazed condition; but he persistently kept his back turned
to the crouching figure propped up against the settee.
NA
NA
Unlocking a cupboard, he took out a tiny figure some two inches long by
one inch high, mounted upon a polished wooden pedestal. It was that of
a guinea-pig. The flaky fur gleamed like the finest silk, and one felt
that the coat of the minute creature would be as floss to the touch;
whereas in reality it possessed the rigidity of steel. Literally
one could have done it little damage with a hammer. Its weight was
extraordinary.

Kreener, placing the little figure upon a table. â€œFor instance, while
it seems to operate uniformly upon vegetable matter, there are curious
modifications when one applies it to animal and mineral substances. I
have now definitely decided that the result of this particular inquiry
must never be published. You, Colquhoun, I believe, possess an example
of the process, a tiger lily, I think? I must ask you to return it to
me. Our late friend, Tcheriapin, wears a pink rose in his coat which I
have treated in the same way. I am going to take the liberty of removing

He spoke in the hard, incisive manner which I had heard him use in
the lecture theatre, and it was evident enough that his design was to
prepare Andrews for something which he contemplated. Facing the Scotsman
where he sat hunched up in the big armchair, dully watching the speaker:

His voice rang now with a note of repressed excitement. He paused for a
moment, and then:

and rested his finger upon the tiny figure of the guinea-pig, â€œyou would
find that in one particular it is imperfect. Although a diamond drill
would have to be employed to demonstrate the fact, the animalâ€™s organs,
despite their having undergone a chemical change quite new to science,
are intact, perfect down to the smallest detail. One part of the
creatureâ€™s structure alone defied my process. In short, dental enamel is
impervious to it. This little animal, otherwise as complete as when it
lived and breathed, has no teeth. I found it necessary to extract them
NA
He paused.
NA
Andrews, to whose mind, I think, no conception of the doctorâ€™s project
had yet penetrated, shuddered, but slowly nodded his head.
Dr. Kreener glanced across the laboratory at the crouching figure of
Tcheriapin, then, resting his hands upon Andrewsâ€™s shoulders, he pushed
him back in the chair and stared into his dull eyes.
NA
Turning, he crossed to a small mahogany cabinet at the farther end of
the room. Pulling out a glass tray he judicially selected a pair of
dental forceps.
II
NA
Thus far the strangerâ€™s appalling story had progressed when that
singular cloak in which hypnotically he had enwrapped me seemed to drop,
and I found myself clutching the edge of the table and staring into the
gray face of the speaker.
I became suddenly aware of the babel of voices about me, of the noisome
smell of Malay Jackâ€™s, and of the presence of Jack in person, who was
inquiring if there were any further orders. I was conscious of nausea.
NA
NA
NA
which throughout the dreadful story had rendered me oblivious of my
surroundings, â€œI should be much favoured if you would accompany me to a

Seeing me hesitate:
NA
NA
NA
Going up the steps and out through the door above which the blue lantern
burned, we came to the street, turned to the left, to the left again,
and soon were threading that maze of narrow ways which complicates the
map of Pennyfields.
I felt somewhat recovered. Here, in the narrow but familiar highways the
spell of my singular acquaintance lost much of its potency, and already
I found myself doubting the story of Dr. Kreener and Tcheriapin. Indeed,
I began to laugh at myself, conceiving that I had fallen into the hands
of some comedian who was making sport of me; although why such a person
should visit Malay Jackâ€™s was not apparent.
I was about to give expression to these new and saner ideas when my
companion paused before a door half hidden in a little alley which
divided the back of a Chinese restaurant from the tawdry-looking
establishment of a cigar merchant. He apparently held the key, for
although I did not actually hear the turning of the lock I saw that he
had opened the door.
NA
NA
Again the cloak touched me, but it was without entirely resigning myself
to the compelling influence that I followed my mysterious acquaintance
up an uncarpeted and nearly dark stair. On the landing above a gas
lamp was burning, and opening a door immediately facing the stair the
stranger conducted me into a barely furnished and untidy room.
The atmosphere smelled like that of a pot-house, the odours of stale
spirits and of tobacco mingling unpleasantly. As my guide removed
his hat and stood there, a square, gaunt figure in his queer, caped
overcoat, I secured for the first time a view of his face in profile;
and found it to be startlingly unfamiliar. Seen thus, my acquaintance
was another man. I realized that there was something unnatural about the
long, white hair, the gray face; that the sharp outline of brow, nose,
and chin was that of a much younger man than I had supposed him to be.
All this came to me in a momentary flash of perception, for immediately
my attention was riveted upon a figure hunched up on a dilapidated sofa
on the opposite side of the room. It was that of a big man, bearded and
very heavily built, but whose face was scarred as by years of suffering,
and whose eyes confirmed the story indicated by the smell of stale
spirits with which the air of the room was laden. A nearly empty bottle
stood on a table at his elbow, a glass beside it, and a pipe lay in a
saucer full of ashes near the glass.
As we entered, the glazed eyes of the man opened widely and he clutched
at the table with big red hands, leaning forward and staring horribly.
Save for this derelict figure and some few dirty utensils and scattered
garments which indicated that the apartment was used both as sleeping
and living room, there was so little of interest in the place that
automatically my wandering gaze strayed from the figure on the sofa to
a large oil painting, unframed, which rested upon the mantelpiece above
the dirty grate, in which the fire had become extinguished.
NA
original painting!
On the left of it, from a nail in the wall, hung a violin and bow, and
on the right stood a sort of cylindrical glass case or closed jar, upon
a wooden base.
From the moment that I perceived the contents of this glass case a sense
of fantasy claimed me, and I ceased to know where reality ended and
mirage began.
It contained a tiny and perfect figure of a man. He was arrayed in a
beautifully fitting dress-suit such as a doll might have worn, and he
was posed as if in the act of playing a violin, although no violin
was present. At the elfin black hair and Mephistophelian face of this
horrible, wonderful image, I stared fascinatedly.
I looked and looked at the dwarfed figure of... Tcheriapin!
All these impressions came to me in the space of a few hectic moments,
when in upon my mental tumult intruded a husky whisper from the man on
the sofa.
NA
At the sound of that name, and because of the way in which it was
pronounced, I felt my blood running cold. The speaker was staring
straight at my companion.
I clutched at the open door. I felt that there was still some crowning
horror to come. I wanted to escape from that reeking room, but my
muscles refused to obey me, and there I stood while:
NA
rising unsteadily to his feet.
â€œYou have brought him again. Why have you brought him again? He will

NA
NA
Even as the other obeyed him, the cloaked stranger, stepping to the
mantelpiece, opened a small box which lay there beside the glass case.
He turned to me; and I tried to shrink away from him. For I knew--I
knew--yet I loathed to look upon--what was in the box. Muffled as though
reaching me through fog, I heard the words:
â€œA perfect human body...in miniature... every organ intact by means
of... process... rendered indestructible. Tcheriapin as he was in life
may be seen by the curious ten thousand years hence. Incomplete... one
NA
The spell was broken by a horrifying shriek from the man whom my
companion had addressed as Colquhoun, and whom I could only suppose
to be the painter of the celebrated picture which rested upon the
mantelshelf.
NA
Animation returned to me, and I fell rather than ran down the darkened
stair. How I opened the street door I know not, but even as I stepped
out into the squalid alleys of Pennyfields the cloaked figure was beside
me. A hand was laid upon my shoulder.
NA
Clearly, with an eerie sweetness, an evil, hellish beauty indescribable,
the wailing of a Stradivarius violin crept to my ears from the room
above. Slowly--slowly the music began, and my soul rose up in revolt.
NA
THE DANCE OF THE VEILS
I
THE HOUSE OF THE AGAPOULOS
Hassan came in and began very deliberately to light the four lamps.
He muttered to himself and often smiled in the childish manner which
characterizes some Egyptians. Hassan wore a red cap, and a white robe
confined at the waist by a red sash. On his brown feet he wore loose
slippers, also of red. He had good features and made a very picturesque
figure moving slowly about his work.
As he lighted lamp after lamp and soft illumination crept about the big
room, because of the heavy shadows created the place seemed to become
mysteriously enlarged. That it was an Eastern apartment cunningly
devised to appeal to the Western eye, one familiar with Arab households
must have seen at once. It was a traditional Oriental interior, a
stage setting rather than the nondescript and generally uninteresting
environment of the modern Egyptian at home.
Brightly coloured divans there were and many silken cushions of strange
pattern and design. The hanging lamps were of perforated brass with
little coloured glass panels. In carved wooden cabinets stood beautiful
porcelain jars, trays, and vessels of silver and copper ware. Rich
carpets were spread about the floor, and the draperies were elegant and
costly, while two deep windows projecting over the court represented the
best period of Arab architecture. Their intricate carven woodwork had
once adorned the palace of a Grand Wazir. Agapoulos had bought them in
Cairo and had had them fitted to his house in Chinatown. A smaller brass
lamp of very delicate workmanship was suspended in each of the recesses.
As Hassan, having lighted the four larger lanterns, was proceeding
leisurely to light the first of the smaller ones, draperies before a
door at the east end of the room were parted and Agapoulos came in.
Agapoulos was a short but portly Greek whom the careless observer might
easily have mistaken for a Jew. He had much of the appearance of a bank
manager, having the manners of one used to making himself agreeable,
but also possessing the money-eye and that comprehensive glance which
belongs to the successful man of commerce.
Standing in the centre of the place he brushed his neat black moustache
with a plump forefinger. A diamond ring which he wore glittered
brilliantly in the coloured rays of the lanterns. With his right hand,
which rested in his trouser pocket, he rattled keys. His glance roved
about the room appraisingly. Walking to a beautifully carved Arab
cabinet he rearranged three pieces of Persian copperware which stood
upon it. He moved several cushions, and taking up a leopard skin which
lay upon the floor he draped it over an ebony chair which was inlaid
intricately with ivory.
The drooping eyelids of M. Agapoulos drooped lower, as returning to the
centre of the room he critically surveyed the effect of these master
touches. At the moment he resembled a window-dresser, or, rather, one
of those high-salaried artists who beautify the great establishments of
Regent Street, the Rue de la Paix, and Ruination Avenue, New York.
Hassan lighted the sixth lamp, muttering smilingly all the time. He was
about to depart when Agapoulos addressed him in Arabic.
â€œThere will be a party down from the Savoy tonight, Hassan. No one else
is to come unless I am told. That accursed red policeman, Kerry, has
NA
Hassan saluted him gravely and retired through one of the draped
openings. In his hand he held the taper with which he had lighted the
lamps. In order that the draperies should not be singed he had to hold
them widely apart. For it had not occurred to Hassan to extinguish the
taper. The Egyptian mind is complex in its simplicity.
M. Agapoulos from a gold case extracted a cigarette, and lighting it,
inhaled the smoke contentedly, looking about him. The window-dresser was
lost again in the bank manager who has arranged a profitable overdraft.
Somewhere a bell rang. Hassan, treading silently, reappeared, crossed
the room, and opening a finely carved door walked along a corridor which
it had concealed. He still carried the lighted taper.
Presently there entered a man whose well-cut serge suit revealed the
figure of a soldier. He wore a soft gray felt hat and carried light
gloves and a cane. His dark face, bronzed by recent exposure to the
Egyptian sun, was handsome in a saturnine fashion, and a touch of gray
at the temples tended to enhance his good looks. He carried himself
in that kind of nonchalant manner which is not only insular but almost
insolent.
M. Agapoulos bowed extravagantly. As he laid his plump hand upon his
breast the diamond ring sparkled in a way most opulent and impressive.

Agapoulos extended the prosperous cigarette-case, and Major Grantham

He spoke with all the bitterness of a man who has made a failure of
life. Agapoulos was quite restored to good humour.

Major Grantham dropped into the carven chair upon which the Greek had
draped the leopard skin. Momentarily the window-dresser leapt into life
as Agapoulos beheld one of his cunning effects destroyed, but he forced
a smile when Grantham, shrugging his shoulders, replied:
â€œIf they are fools enough to play--the usual 5 per cent, on the bankâ€™s

with a flourish more grand than usual that he bowed.

Palpably glad to escape, the fat Greek retired, leaving Major Grantham
lolling there upon the leopard skin, his hat, cane and gloves upon the
carpet beside him; and a few moments later Hassan the silent glided into
the extravagant apartment bearing refreshments. Placing his tray upon a
little coffee-table beside Major Grantham, he departed.
There was a faint smell of perfume in the room, a heavy voluptuous smell
in which the odour of sandal-wood mingled with the pungency of myrrh. It
was very silent, so that when Grantham mixed a drink the pleasant chink
of glass upon glass rang out sharply.
II
ZAHARA
Zahara had overheard the latter part of the conversation from her own
apartment. Once she had even crept across to the carven screen in order
that she might peep through into the big, softly lighted room. She
had interrupted her toilet to do so, and having satisfied herself that
Grantham was one of the speakers (although she had really known this
already), she had returned and stared at herself critically in the
mirror.
Zahara, whose father had been a Frenchman, possessed skin of a subtle
cream colour very far removed from the warm brown of her Egyptian
mother, but yet not white. At night it appeared dazzling, for she
enhanced its smooth, creamy pallor with a wonderful liquid solution
which came from Paris. It was hard, Zahara had learned, to avoid a
certain streaky appearance, but much practice had made her an adept.
This portion of her toilet she had already completed and studying her
own reflection she wondered, as she had always wondered, what Agapoulos
could see in Safiyeh. Safiyeh was as brown as a berry; quite pretty for
an Egyptian girl, as Zahara admitted scornfully, but brown--brown. It
was a great puzzle to Zahara. The mystery of life indeed had puzzled
little Zahara very much from the moment when she had first begun to
notice things with those big, surprising blue eyes of hers, right up to
the present twenty-fourth year of her life. She had an uneasy feeling
that Safiyeh, who was only sixteen, knew more of this mystery than she
did. Once, shortly after the Egyptian girl had come to the house of
Agapoulos, Zahara had playfully placed her round white arm against that
of the more dusky beauty, and:
NA
NA
NA
Zahara rested her elbows upon the table and surveyed the reflection
of her perfect shoulders with disapproval. She had been taught at her
motherâ€™s knee that men did not understand women, and she, who had been
born and reared in that quarter of Cairo where there is no day but one
long night, had lived to learn the truth of the lesson. Yet she was not
surprised that this was so; for Zahara did not understand herself. Her
desires were so simple and so seemingly natural, yet it would appear
that they were contrary to the established order of things.
She was proud to think that she was French, although someone had told
her that the French, though brave, were mercenary. Zahara admired the
French for being brave, and thought it very sensible that they should
be mercenary. For there was nothing that Zahara wanted of the world
that money could not obtain (or so she believed), and she knew no higher
philosophy than the quest of happiness. Because others did not seem to
share this philosophy she often wondered if she could be unusual. She
had come to the conclusion that she was ignorant. If only Harry Grantham
would talk to her she felt sure he could teach her so much.
There were so many things that puzzled her. She knew that at twenty-four
she was young for a French girl, although as an Egyptian she would
have been considered old. She had been taught that gold was the key to
happiness and that man was the ogre from whom this key must be wheedled.
A ready pupil, Zahara had early acquired the art of attracting, and now
at twenty-four she was a past mistress of the Great Craft, and as her
mirror told her, more beautiful than she had ever been.
Therefore, what did Agapoulos see in Safiyeh?
It was a problem which made Zaharaâ€™s head ache. She could not understand
why as her power of winning men increased her power to hold them
diminished. Safiyeh was a mere inexperienced child--yet Agapoulos
had brought her to the house, and Zahara, wise in womanâ€™s lore, had
recognized the familiar change of manner.
It was a great problem, the age-old problem which doubtless set the
first silver thread among Phryneâ€™s red-gold locks and which now brought
a little perplexed wrinkle between Zaharaâ€™s delicately pencilled brows.
It had not always been so. In those early days in Cairo there had been
an American boy. Zahara had never forgotten. Her beauty had bewildered
him. He had wanted to take her to New York; and oh! how she had wanted
to go. But her mother, who was then alive, had held other views, and he
had gone alone. Heavens! How old she felt. How many had come and gone
since that Egyptian winter, but now, although admiration was fatally
easy to win how few were so sincere as that fresh-faced boy from beyond
the Atlantic.
Zahara, staring into the mirror, observed that there was not a wrinkle
upon her face, not a flaw upon her perfect skin. Nor in this was she
blinded by vanity. Nature, indeed, had cast her in a rare mould, and
from her unusual hair, which was like dull gold, to her slender ankles
and tiny feet, she was one of the most perfectly fashioned human beings
who ever added to the beauty of the world.
Yet Agapoulos preferred Safiyeh. Zahara could hear him coming to her
room even as she sat there, chin in hands, staring at her own bewitching
reflection. Presently she would slip out and speak to Harry Grantham.
Twice she had read in his eyes that sort of interest which she knew so
well how to detect. She liked him very much, but because of a sense of
loyalty to Agapoulos (a sentiment purely Egyptian which she longed to
crush) Zahara had never so much as glanced at Grantham in the Right Way.
She was glad, though, that he had not gone, and she hoped that Agapoulos
would not detain her long.
As a matter of fact, the Greekâ€™s manner was even more cold than usual.
He rested his hand upon her shoulder for a moment, and meeting her
glance reflected in the mirror:
NA
of your opportunities. Chinatown is foggy, yes--but it pays better than
NA
He ran fat fingers carelessly through her hair, the big diamond
glittering effectively in the wavy gold, then turned and went out.
Sitting listening intently, Zahara could hear him talking in a subdued
voice to Safiyeh, and could detect the Egyptianâ€™s low-spoken replies.
*****
Grantham looked up with a start. A new and subtle perfume had added
itself to that with which the air of the room was already laden. He
found Zahara standing beside him.
His glance travelled upward from a pair of absurdly tiny brocaded
shoes past slender white ankles to the embroidered edge of a wonderful
mandarin robe decorated with the figures of peacocks; upward again to
a little bejewelled hand which held the robe confined about the slender
figure of Zahara, and upward to where, sideways upon a bare shoulder
peeping impudently out from Chinese embroidery, rested the half-mocking
and half-serious face of the girl.

NA
NA
NA
added, and in the tone of her voice there was a caress. â€œI saw you more
NA
NA
there has been nobody worth while at any of the hotels or clubs during
NA
NA
interest.
At the very moment that she uttered the words she recognized her error,
for she saw Granthamâ€™s expression change. Yet to her strange soul there
was a challenge in his coldness and the joy of contest in the task of
melting the ice of this English reserve.
NA
Zahara did not reply for a moment. She wished to close this line of
conversation which inadvertently she had opened up. So that, presently:
NA
As a matter of fact, it was she who was bored of the life she led in
Limehouse--in chilly, misty Limehouse--and who had grown so very lonely
since Safiyeh had come. In the dark gray eyes looking up at her she read
recognition of her secret. Here was a man possessing that rare masculine
attribute, intuition. Zahara knew a fear that was half delightful. Fear
because she might fail in either of two ways and delight because the
contest was equal.
NA
Zahara observed that his curiosity had not yet become actual interest.
She toyed with the silken tassel on her robe, tying and untying it with
quick nervous fingers and resting the while against the side of the
carved chair.
NA
NA
She spread her small hands eloquently and shrugged so that another white
shoulder escaped from the Chinese wrapping. Thereupon Zahara demurely
drew her robe about her with a naive air of modesty which nine out of
ten beholding must have supposed to be affected.
In reality it was a perfectly natural, instinctive movement. To Zahara
her own beauty was a commonplace to be displayed or concealed as
circumstances might dictate. In a certain sense, which few could
appreciate, this half-caste dancing girl and daughter of El Wasr was
as innocent as a baby. It was one of the things which men did not
understand. She thought that if Harry Grantham asked her to go away
with him it would be nice to go. Suddenly she realized how deep was her
loathing of this Limehouse and of the people she met there, who were all
alike.
NA
NA
And because he had answered her thoughts rather than her words, the fear
within Zahara grew greater than the joy of the contest.
Awhile longer she stayed, seeking for a chink in the armour. But she
failed to kindle the light in his eyes which--unless she had deluded
herself--she had seen there in the past; and because she failed and
could detect no note of tenderness in his impersonal curiosity:
NA
drawing her robe about her and glancing sideways toward the door by
which Agapoulos might be expected to enter. â€œYou are bored, yes. Of
course. You look on at life. It is not exciting, that game--except for

Never once had she looked at him in the Right Way; for to have done so
and to have evoked only that amused yet compassionate smile would have
meant hatred, and Zahara had been taught that such hatred was fatal
because it was a confession of defeat.
NA
away.
NA
She tossed her head like a petulant child, turned, and with never
another glance in his direction, walked from the room. She was very
graceful, he thought.
Yet it was not entirely of this strange half-caste, whose beauty was
provoking, although he resolutely repelled her tentative advances, that
Grantham was thinking. In that last gesture when she had scornfully
tossed her head in turning aside, had lain a bitter memory. Grantham
stood for a moment watching the swaying draperies. Then, dropping the
end of his cigarette into a little brass ash-tray, he took up his hat,
gloves, and cane from the floor, and walked toward the doorway through
which he had entered.
A bell rang somewhere, and Grantham paused. A close observer might have
been puzzled by his expression. Evidently changing his mind, he crossed
the room, opened the door and went out, leaving the house of Agapoulos
by a side entrance. Crossing the little courtyard below he hurried in
the direction of the main street, seeming to doubt the shadows which
dusk was painting in the narrow ways.
Many men who know Chinatown distrust its shadows, but the furtive fear
of which Grantham had become aware was due not to anticipation but to
memory--to a memory conjured up by that gesture of Zaharaâ€™s.
There were few people in London or elsewhere who knew the history of
this scallywag Englishman. That he had held the Kingâ€™s commission at
some time was generally assumed to be the fact, but that his real
name was not Grantham equally was taken for granted. His continuing,
NA
interested that Grantham lived by his wits; and from the fact that he
lived well and dressed well one might have deduced that his wits were
bright if his morals were turbid.
Now, the gesture of a woman piqued had called up the deathless past.
Hurrying through nearly empty squalid streets, he found himself longing
to pronounce a name, to hear it spoken that he might linger over its
bitter sweetness. To this longing he presently succumbed, and:
NA
Such a wave of lonely wretchedness and remorse swept up about his heart
that he was almost overwhelmed by it, yet he resigned himself to
its ruthless cruelty with a sort of savage joy. The shadowed ways of
Limehouse ceased to exist for him, and in spirit he stood once more in
a queer, climbing, sunbathed street of Gibraltar looking out across that
blue ribbon of the Straits to where the African coast lay hidden in the
haze.
NA
along and muttered to himself must have supposed him to be mad. â€œI never
NA
But he was one of those to whom knowledge comes as a bitter aftermath.
When his regiment had received orders to move from the Rock, and he had
informed Inez of his departure, she had turned aside, just as Zahara had
done; scornfully and in silence. Because of his disbelief in her he
had guarded his heart against this beautiful Spanish girl who (as he
realized too late) had brought him the only real happiness he had ever
known. Often she had told him of her brother, Miguel, who would kill
her--would kill them both--if he so much as suspected their meetings; of
her affianced husband, absent in Tunis, whose jealousy knew no bounds.
He had pretended to believe, had even wanted to believe; but the
witchery of the girlâ€™s presence removed, he had laughed--at himself and
at Inez. She was playing the Great Game, skilfully, exquisitely. When
he was gone--there would soon be someone else. Yet he had never told her
that he doubted. He had promised many things--and had left her.
She died by her own hand on the night of his departure.
NA
NA
That brother whom he had counted a myth had succeeded in getting on
board the transport. Before Granthamâ€™s inner vision the whole dreadful
scene now was reenacted: the struggle in the stateroom; he even seemed
to hear the sound of the shot, to see the Spaniard, drenched with blood
from a wound in his forehead, to hear his cry:
NA
It had broken Grantham. The scandal was hushed up, but retirement was
inevitable. He knew, too, that the light had gone out of the world for
him as it had gone for Miguel da Mura.
It is sometimes thus that a scallywag is made.
IV
THE STAR OF EGYPT
As Grantham went out by the side door, Hassan, soft of foot, appeared.
Crossing to the main door he opened it and walked down the narrow
corridor beyond. Presently came the tap, tap, tap of a stick and a sound
of muttered conversation in some place below.
Hassan reentered and went in through the curtained doorway to summon
Agapoulos. Agapoulos was dressing and would not be disturbed. Hassan
went back to those who waited, but ere long returned again chattering
volubly to himself. Going behind the carven screen he rapped upon the
door of Zaharaâ€™s room, and she directed him to come in. To Zahara,
Hassan was no more than a piece of furniture, and she thought as little
of his intruding while she was in the midst of her toilet as another
woman would have thought of the entrance of a maid.

Zahara invariably spoke either French or English to natives, and if
Hassan had addressed her in Arabic she would not have replied, although
she spoke that language better than she spoke any other.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Zahara, a student of men, became aware of a mild interest. These swarthy
visitors should prove an agreeable antidote to the poisonous calm of
Harry Grantham. She was trying with all the strength of her strange,
stifled soul not to think of Grantham, and she was incapable of
recognizing the fact that she could think of nothing else and had
thought of little else for a long time past. Even now it was because of
him that she determined to interview the foreign visitors. The mystery
of her emotions puzzled her more than ever.
She descended to a small, barely furnished room on the ground floor,
close beside the door opening upon the street. It was lighted by one
hanging lamp. On the divan which constituted the principal item
of furniture a small man, slenderly built, was sitting. He wore a
broad-brimmed hat, so broad of brim that it threw the whole of the upper
part of his face into shadow. It was impossible to see his eyes. Beside
him rested a heavy walking-stick.
As Zahara entered, a wonderful, gaily coloured figure, this man did not
move in the slightest, but sat, chin on breast, his small, muscular,
brown hands resting on his knees. His companion, however, a person of
more massive build, elegantly dressed and handsome in a swarthy fashion,
bowed gravely and removed his hat. Zahara liked his eyes, which were
dark and very bold looking.
NA
NA
The man regarded her fixedly, and:
NA
NA
drew her robe more closely about her and adopted her most stately
manner.
NA
NA
Zahara, who understood from this that the man was some kind of inquiry
agent, opened her blue eyes very widely and at the same time shook her
head.
NA
â€œA certain gentleman came here a short time ago, came into this
house and must be here now. Donâ€™t be afraid. He has done nothing very
NA
Zahara retreated a step, and a little wrinkle of disapproval appeared
between her pencilled brows. She no longer liked the manâ€™s eyes, she
decided. They were deceitful eyes. His companion had taken up the heavy
stick and was restlessly tapping the floor.
NA
NA
NA
The tapping of his stick had grown more rapid, but as he had spoken in
Spanish, Zahara, who was ignorant of that language, had no idea what he
had said.
NA
of the slender man who so persistently kept his broad-brimmed hat on his
head, â€œchanced to hear the voice of this gentleman as he spoke to your

NA
NA
As she uttered the words she realized that even the memory of Grantham
was sufficient to cause her to betray herself. She had betrayed her
interest to the man himself, and now she had betrayed it to this
dark-faced stranger whose manner was so mysterious. The Spaniard
recognized the fact, and, unlike Grantham, acted upon it promptly.
NA
watched her as he spoke the lie.
She listened in silence, wide-eyed. Her lower lip twitched, and she bit
it fiercely.
NA
 continued the Spaniard remorselessly. â€œWe come from her husband to ask
NA
Rapidly but comprehensively the speakerâ€™s bold glance travelled over
Zahara, from her golden head to her tiny embroidered shoes.
â€œIf you can help us in this matter it will be worth fifty English pounds
NA
Zahara was breathing rapidly. The fatal hatred which she had sought to
stifle gained a new vitality. Another woman--another woman actually
here in London! So there was someone upon whom he did not look in that
half-amused and half-compassionate manner. How she hated him! How she
hated the woman to whom he had but a moment ago returned!
NA
NA
Zahara experienced a swift change of sentiment. She seemed to be
compounded of two separate persons, one of whom laughed cruelly at the
folly of the other.

asked.
The big stick was rapping furiously during this colloquy.

That Spalding and Grantham were neighbouring towns in Lincolnshire
Zahara did not know, but:

spoke with forced calm. It was Grantham they sought! â€œBut what happens

For a long moment Zahara hesitated, then:

Exhibiting a sort of eager impatience the man displayed a bunch of
official-looking documents.

And speaking close to her ear he rapidly outlined a plan; but presently
she interrupted him.
NA
NA
Awhile longer they talked, the rapping of the stick upon the tiled floor
growing ever faster and faster. But finally:
NA
held out her hand for the notes.
When, presently, the visitors departed, she learned that the smaller
man was blind; for his companion led him out of the room and out of
the house. She stood awhile listening to the tap, tap, tap of the heavy
stick receding along the street. What she did not hear, and could not
have understood had she heard, since it was uttered in Spanish, was the
cry of exultant hatred which came from the lips of the taller man:
â€œAt last, Miguel! at last! Though blind, you have found him! You have

*****
Zahara peeped through the carved screen at the assembled company. They
were smoking and drinking and seemed to be in high good humour. Safiyeh
had danced and they had applauded the performance, but had complained
to M. Agapoulos that they had seen scores of such dances and dancers.
Safiyeh, who had very little English, had not understood this, and
because presently she was to play upon the aâ€™ood while Zahara danced the
Dance of the Veils, Zahara had avoided informing her of the verdict of
the company.
Now as she peeped through the lattice in the screen she could see
the Greek haggling with Grantham and a tall gray-haired man whom she
supposed to be Sir Horace Tipton. They were debating the additional fees
to be paid if Zahara, the Star of Egypt, was to present the secret
and wonderful dance of which all men had heard but which only a true
daughter of the ancient tribe of the Ghawazi could perform.
Sometimes Zahara was proud of her descent from a dancing-girl of Kenneh.
This was always at night, when a sort of barbaric excitement possessed
her which came from the blood of her mother. Then, a new light entered
her eyes and they seemed to grow long and languid and dark, so that no
one would have suspected that in daylight they were blue.
A wild pagan abandon claimed her, and she seemed to hear the wailing of
reed instruments and the throb of the ancient drums which were played of
old before the kings of Egypt. Safiyeh was not a true dancing girl,
and because she knew none of those fine frenzies, she danced without
inspiration, like a brown puppet moved by strings. But she could play
upon an aâ€™ood much better than Zahara, and therefore must not be upset
until she had played for the Dance of the Veils.
Seeing that the bargain was all but concluded, Zahara stole back to
her room. Her lightly clad body gleamed like that of some statue become
animate.
Her cheeks flushed as she took up the veils, of which she alone knew the
symbolic meaning; the white veil, the purple veil: each had its story to
tell her; and the veil of burning scarlet. In a corner of the big room
on a divan near the door she had seen the Spaniard, a handsome, swarthy
figure in his well-fitting dress clothes, and now, opening a drawer, she
glanced at the little pile of notes which represented her share of the
bargain. There were fifty. She had told Agapoulos that a distinguished
foreigner with an introduction from someone she knew had paid ten pounds
to be present. And because she had given Agapoulos the ten pounds,
Agapoulos had agreed to admit the visitor.
She could hear the Greek approaching now, but she was thinking of
Grantham whom she had last seen in laughing conversation with the tall,
gray-haired man. His laughter had appeared forced. Doubtless he grew
weary of the woman he had brought to London.
NA
Agapoulos, hurrying into the room.
Zahara turned aside, toying with the veils.
NA
She was thinking of the fifty pounds which she had earned so easily; and
after all (how strangely her mind wandered) perhaps he was really tired
of the woman. The Spaniard had said so.
NA
He brushed his moustache and rattled keys in his pocket. In his dress
clothes he looked like the manager of a prosperous picture palace.
NA
When presently the music commenced, the players concealed behind the
tall screen, an expectant hush fell upon the wine-flushed company.
Hassan, who played the darabukkeh, could modulate its throbbing so
wonderfully.
Zahara entered the room, enveloped from shoulders to ankles in a
flame-coloured cloak. Between her lips she held a red rose.
NA
Zahara did not know which of the party had spoken, but she was conscious
of the fact that by virtue of the strange witchcraft which became hers
on such nights she held them all spell-bound. They were her slaves.
Slowly she walked across the apartment while the throbbing of the Arab
drum grew softer and softer, producing a weird effect of space and
distance. All eyes were fixed upon her, and meeting Granthamâ€™s gaze she
saw at last the Light there which she knew. This sudden knowledge of
triumph almost unnerved her, and the rose which she had taken from
between her lips trembled in her white fingers. Two of the petals fell
upon the carpet, which was cream-coloured from the looms of Ispahan.
Like blood spots the petals lay upon the cream surface.
Zahara swung sharply about. Agapoulos, seated alone in the chair over
which he had draped the leopard skin, was busily brushing his moustache
and glancing sideways toward the screen which concealed Safryeh. Zahara
tilted her head on to her shoulder and cast a languorous glance into the
shadows masking the watchful Spaniard.
She could see his eyes gleaming like those of a wild beast. An icy
finger seemed to touch her heart. He had lied to her! She knew it,
suddenly, intuitively. Well, she would see. She also had guile.
With a little scornful laugh Zahara tossed the rose on to the knees--of
Agapoulos.
The sound of three revolver shots fired in quick succession rang out
above the throbbing music. Agapoulos clutched at his shirt front with
both hands, uttered a stifled scream and tried to stand up. He coughed,
and glaring straight in front of him fell forward across a little coffee
table laden with champagne bottles and glasses.
Coincident with the crash made by his falling body came the loud bang of
a door. The Spaniard had gone.
NA
which had commented upon the beauty of Zahara.
There was a mingling, purposeless movement. Someone ran to the door--to
find that it was locked from the outside. Mr. Eddie, now recognizable by
his accent, came toward the prone man, dazed, horrified, and grown very
white. Zahara, a beautiful, tragic figure, in her flaming cloak, stood
looking down at the dead man. Safiyeh was peeping round from behind
the screen, her face a brown mask of terror. Hassan, holding his drum,
appeared behind her, staring stupidly. To the smell of cigar smoke and
perfume a new and acrid odour was added.
Vaguely the truth was stealing in upon the mind of the dancing-girl that
she had been made party to a plot to murder Grantham. She had saved his
life. He belonged to her now. She could hear him speaking, although
for some reason she could not see him. A haze had come, blotting out
everything but the still, ungainly figure which lay so near her upon
the carpet, one clutching, fat hand, upon which a diamond glittered,
outstretched so that it nearly touched her bare white feet.
â€œWe must get out this way! The side door to the courtyard! None of us
NA
There was more confused movement and a buzz of excited
voices--meaningless, chaotic. Zahara could feel the draught from the
newly opened door. A thin stream of blood was stealing across the
carpet. It had almost reached the fallen rose petals, which it strangely
resembled in colour under the light of the lanterns.
As though dispersed by the draught, the haze lifted, and Zahara saw
Grantham standing by the open doorway through which he had ushered out
the other visitors.
Wide-eyed and piteous she met his glance. She had seen that night the
Look in his eyes. She had saved his life, and there was much, so
much, that she wanted to tell him. A thousand yearnings, inexplicable,
hitherto unknown, deep mysteries of her soul, looked out of those great
eyes.
NA
NA
He went out and closed the door. The flame-coloured cloak slowly slipped
from Zaharaâ€™s shoulders, and the veils, like falling petals, began to
drop gently one by one upon the blood-stained carpet.

 declared Jennings. â€œHe never asked me to go there, but, then, I took
NA
NA
NA
in the winter of â€˜15, after the nativesâ€™ attempt to mutiny. He had been
drinking rather heavily, a fact which he was quite unable to disguise.
He was never by any means a real friend of mine; in fact, I doubt that
he had a true friend in the world. Anyhow, I could see that he was
lonely, and as I chanced to be at a loose end I accepted an invitation
to go over to what he termed his â€˜little place at Katong.â€™
â€œHis little place proved to be a veritable palace. The man privately, or
rather, secretly, to be exact, kept up a sort of pagan state. He had any
number of servants. Of course he became practically a millionaire after
the death of his father, as you will remember; and given more congenial
company, I must confess that I might have spent a most enjoyable evening
there.
â€œAdderley insisted upon priming me with champagne, and after a while I
may as well admit that I lost something of my former reserve, and began
in a fashion to feel that I was having a fairly good time. By the way,
my host was not quite frankly drunk. He got into that objectionable and
dangerous mood which some of you will recall, and I could see by the
light in his eyes that there was mischief brewing, although at the time
I did not know its nature.
â€œI should explain that we were amusing ourselves in a room which was
nearly as large as the lounge of this hotel, and furnished in a somewhat
similar manner. There were carved pillars and stained glass domes,
a little fountain, and all those other peculiarities of an Eastern
household.
â€œPresently, Adderley gave an order to one of his servants, and glanced
at me with that sort of mocking, dare-devil look in his eyes which I
loathed, which everybody loathed who ever met the man. Of course I had
no idea what all this portended, but I was very shortly to learn.
â€œWhile he was still looking at me, but stealing side-glances at a
doorway before which was draped a most wonderful curtain of a sort of
flamingo colour, this curtain was suddenly pulled aside, and a girl came
in.
â€œOf course, you must remember that at the time of which I am speaking
the scandal respecting the mandarin had not yet come to light.
Consequently I had no idea who the girl could be. I saw she was a
Eurasian. But of her striking beauty there could be no doubt whatever.
She was dressed in magnificent robes, and she literally glittered with
jewels. She even wore jewels upon the toes of her little bare feet. But
the first thing that struck me at the moment of her appearance was that
her presence there was contrary to her wishes and inclinations. I have
never seen a similar expression in any womanâ€™s eyes. She looked at
Adderley as though she would gladly have slain him!
â€œSeeing this look, his mocking smile in which there was something
of triumph--of the joy of possession--turned to a scowl of positive
brutality. He clenched his fists in a way that set me bristling. He
advanced toward the girl--and although the width of the room divided
them, she recoiled--and the significance of expression and gesture was
unmistakable. Adderley paused.
â€œâ€˜So you have made up your mind to dance after all?â€™ he shouted.
â€œThe look in the girlâ€™s dark eyes was pitiful, and she turned to me with
a glance of dumb entreaty.
â€œâ€˜No, no!â€™ she cried. â€˜No, no! Why do you bring me here?â€™
â€œâ€˜Dance!â€™ roared Adderley. â€˜Dance! Thatâ€™s what I want you to do.â€™
â€œRebellion leapt again to the wonderful eyes, and she started back with
a perfectly splendid gesture of defiance. At that my brutal and drunken
host leapt in her direction. I was on my feet now, but before I could
act the girl said a thing which checked him, sobered him, which pulled
him up short, as though he had encountered a stone wall.
â€œâ€˜Ah, God!â€™ she said. (She was speaking, of course, in her native
tongue.) â€˜His hand! His hand! Look! His hand!â€™
â€œTo me her words were meaningless, naturally, but following the
direction of her positively agonized glance I saw that she was watching
what seemed to me to be the shadow of someone moving behind the
flame-like curtain which produced an effect not unlike that of a huge,
outstretched hand, the fingers crooked, claw-fashion.
â€œâ€˜Knox, Knox!â€™ whispered Adderley, grasping me by the shoulder.
â€œHe pointed with a quivering finger toward this indistinct shadow upon
the curtain, and:
â€œâ€˜Do you see it--do you see it?â€™ he said huskily. â€˜It is his hand--it is
his hand!â€™
â€œOf the pair, I think, the man was the more frightened. But the girl,
uttering a frightful shriek, ran out of the room as though pursued by
a demon. As she did so whoever had been moving behind the curtain
evidently went away. The shadow disappeared, and Adderley, still staring
as if hypnotized at the spot where it had been, continued to hold my
shoulder as in a vise. Then, sinking down upon a heap of cushions beside
me, he loudly and shakily ordered more champagne.
â€œUtterly mystified by the incident, I finally left him in a state of
stupor, and returned to my quarters, wondering whether I had dreamed
half of the episode or the whole of it, whether he did really possess

I ceased speaking, and my story was received in absolute silence, until:

was, as you know, doing voluntary surgical work near Singapore at the
time, and one evening, presumably about the same period of which Knox is
speaking, I was returning from the hospital at Katong, at which I acted
sometimes as anaesthetist, to my quarters in Singapore; just drifting
along, leisurely by the edge of the gardens admiring the beauty of the
mangroves and the deceitful peace of the Eastern night.
â€œThe hour was fairly late and not a soul was about. Nothing
disturbed the silence except those vague sibilant sounds which are
so characteristic of the country. Presently, as I rambled on with my
thoughts wandering back to the dim ages, I literally fell over a man who
lay in the road.
â€œI was naturally startled, but I carried an electric pocket torch, and
by its light I discovered that the person over whom I had fallen was a
dignified-looking Chinaman, somewhat past middle age. His clothes, which
were of good quality, were covered with dirt and blood, and he bore all
the appearance of having recently been engaged in a very tough struggle.
His face was notable only for its possession of an unusually long

and accordingly I extemporized a rough tourniquet and left him under

However, at least I gave him a chance of life. He was under my care for
some time, but I doubt if ever he was properly grateful. He had an iron
constitution, though, and I finally allowed him to depart. One queer
stipulation he had made--that the severed hand, with its golden
nail-case, should be given to him when he left hospital. And this

â€œHe was very reticent, but I made a number of inquiries, and finally

had been detected by the prime object of his hatred. In hurriedly
descending from a window he had been attacked by some weapon, possibly
a sword, and had only made good his escape in the condition in which I
found him. How far he had proceeded I cannot say, but I should imagine
that the house to which he had been was no great distance from the spot

II
THE LADY OF KATONG
Fully six months had elapsed, and on returning from Singapore I had
forgotten all about Adderley and the unsavoury stories connected with
his reputation. Then, one evening as I was strolling aimlessly along
St. Jamesâ€™s Street, wondering how I was going to kill time--for almost
everyone I knew was out of town, including Paul Harley, and London can
be infinitely more lonely under such conditions than any desert--I saw a
thick-set figure approaching along the other side of the street.
The swing of the shoulders, the aggressive turn of the head, were
vaguely familiar, and while I was searching my memory and endeavouring
to obtain a view of the manâ€™s face, he stared across in my direction.
It was Adderley.
He looked even more debauched than I remembered him, for whereas in
Singapore he had had a tanned skin, now he looked unhealthily pallid and
blotchy. He raised his hand, and:
NA
His boisterous manner and a sort of coarse geniality which he possessed
had made him popular with a certain set in former days, but I, who
knew that this geniality was forced, and assumed to conceal a sort of
appalling animalism, had never been deceived by it. Most people found
Adderley out sooner or later, but I had detected the manâ€™s true nature
from the very beginning. His eyes alone were danger signals for any
amateur psychologist. However, I greeted him civilly enough:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
He laughed loudly. That he had already explored several bottles was
palpable.
We were silent for a while, mentally weighing one another up, as it
were. Then:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Probably I should have refused, but even as he spoke I was mentally
translated to the lounge of the Hotel de lâ€™Europe, and prompted by a
very human curiosity I determined to accept his invitation. I wondered
if Fate had thrown an opportunity in my way of learning the end of the
peculiar story which had been related on that occasion.
I accompanied Adderley to his chambers, which were within a stoneâ€™s
throw of the spot where I had met him. That this gift for making himself
unpopular with all and sundry, high and low, had not deserted him, was
illustrated by the attitude of the liftman as we entered the hall of the
chambers. He was barely civil to Adderley and even regarded myself with
marked disfavour.
We were admitted by Adderleyâ€™s man, whom I had not seen before, but who
was some kind of foreigner, I think a Portuguese. It was characteristic
of Adderley. No Englishman would ever serve him for long, and there
had been more than one man in his old Company who had openly avowed his
intention of dealing with Adderley on the first available occasion.
His chambers were ornately furnished; indeed, the room in which we sat
more closely resembled a scene from an Oscar Asche production than a
normal manâ€™s study. There was something unreal about it all. I have
since thought that this unreality extended to the person of the man
himself. Grossly material, he yet possessed an aura of mystery, mystery
of an unsavoury sort. There was something furtive, secretive, about
Adderleyâ€™s entire mode of life.
I had never felt at ease in his company, and now as I sat staring
wonderingly at the strange and costly ornaments with which the room was
overladen I bethought me of the object of my visit. How I should have
brought the conversation back to our Singapore days I know not, but a
suitable opening was presently offered by Adderley himself.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œTwo or three of them were taking what Dr. Matheson described as a

At mention of Dr. Mathesonâ€™s name Adderley visibly started.
NA
NA
Plainly to hide his confusion he stood up, and crossing the room drew
my attention to a rather fine silver bowl of early Persian ware. He was
displaying its peculiar virtues and showing a certain acquaintance with
his subject when he was interrupted. A door opened suddenly and a girl
came in. Adderley put down the bowl and turned rapidly as I rose from my
seat.
It was the lady of Katong!
I recognized her at once, although she wore a very up-to-date gown.
While it did not suit her dark good looks so well as the native dress
which she had worn at Singapore, yet it could not conceal the fact that
in a barbaric way she was a very beautiful woman. On finding a visitor
in the room she became covered with confusion.
NA
NA
Adderleyâ€™s reply was characteristically brutal.
NA
I turned to go, for I was conscious of an intense desire to attack my
host. But:
NA
NA
He paused, and looked at me in a queer sort of appealing way. The girl,
her big eyes widely open, retreated again to the door, with curious
lithe steps, characteristically Oriental. The door regained, she paused
for a moment and extended one small hand in Adderleyâ€™s direction.
NA
She went out, quietly closing the door behind her. Adderley turned to me
with an embarrassed laugh.
NA

But if ever a man paid for his mistakes I have paid for mine, Knox. Good

the settee, ruffling his hair with his hands and looking the picture of
haggard misery. Seeing that I was still set upon departure:
NA
NA
He crossed to a sideboard and mixed himself a stiff whisky-and-soda. He
asked me to join him, but I refused.
NA
I shook my head.
NA
NA
I nodded.
â€œThis is what I want to ask you: Did you, or did you not, see that

I stared him hard in the face.
NA
NA
NA
â€œTo me it seemed an indefinite, shapeless thing, as though caused by

NA
NA
Adderley groaned.
NA
NA
NA
Let me confess that I was only suffering the manâ€™s society because of
an intense curiosity which now possessed me on learning that the lady of
Katong was still in Adderleyâ€™s company.
Whether my repugnance for his society would have enabled me to remain
any longer I cannot say. But as if Fate had deliberately planned that I
should become a witness of the concluding phases of this secret drama,
we were now interrupted a second time, and again in a dramatic fashion.
Adderleyâ€™s nondescript valet came in with letters and a rather large
brown paper parcel sealed and fastened with great care.
As the man went out:
NA
parcel.
He seemed to become temporarily oblivious of my presence, and his face
grew even more haggard as he studied the writing upon the wrapper.
With unsteady fingers he untied it, and I lingered, watching curiously.
Presently out from the wrappings he took a very beautiful casket of
ebony and ivory, cunningly carved and standing upon four claw-like ivory
legs.
NA
He opened the box, which was lined with sandal-wood, and thereupon
started back with a great cry, recoiling from the casket as though
it had contained an adder. My former sentiments forgotten, I stepped
forward and peered into the interior. Then I, in turn, recoiled.
In the box lay a shrivelled yellow hand--with long tapering and
well-manicured nails--neatly severed at the wrist!
The nail of the index finger was enclosed in a tiny, delicately
fashioned case of gold, upon which were engraved a number of Chinese
characters.
Adderley sank down again upon the settee.
NA
He began laughing. Whereupon, since I could see that the man was
practically hysterical because of his mysterious fears:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
He was quite beyond reason, and therefore:

THE GOLD-CASED NAIL
As I descended to the street the liftman regarded me in a curious and
rather significant way. Finally, just as I was about to step out into
the hall:

NA
NA
â€œWell, sir, I hope you will excuse me, but at times I have thought the

â€œWell, sir, I donâ€™t know, but he is always asking me if I can see

I lingered, the box under my arm, reluctant to obtain confidences from a
servant, but at the same time keenly interested. Thus encouraged:
NA
NA
narrowly.
NA
concluded.
*****
Having returned to my room at the hotel, I set down the mysterious
parcel, surveying it with much disfavour. That it contained the hand of
the Mandarin Quong I could not doubt, the hand which had been amputated
by Dr. Matheson. Its appearance in that dramatic fashion confirmed
Mathesonâ€™s idea that the mandarinâ€™s injury had been received at the
hands of Adderley. What did all this portend, unless that the Mandarin
Quong was dead? And if he were dead why was Adderley more afraid of him
dead than he had been of him living?
I thought of the haunting shadow, I thought of the night at Katong, and
I thought of Dr. Mathesonâ€™s words when he had told us of his discovery
of the Chinaman lying in the road that night outside Singapore.
I felt strangely disinclined to touch the relic, and it was only after
some momentsâ€™ hesitation that I undid the wrappings and raised the lid
of the casket. Dusk was very near and I had not yet lighted the lamps;
therefore at first I doubted the evidence of my senses. But having
lighted up and peered long and anxiously into the sandal-wood lining of
the casket I could doubt no longer.
The casket was empty!
It was like a conjuring trick. That the hand had been in the box when
I had taken it up from Adderleyâ€™s table I could have sworn before any
jury. When and by whom it had been removed was a puzzle beyond my powers
of unravelling. I stepped toward the telephone--and then remembered that
Paul Harley was out of London. Vaguely wondering if Adderley had played
me a particularly gruesome practical joke, I put the box on a sideboard
and again contemplated the telephone doubtfully far a moment. It was in
my mind to ring him up. Finally, taking all things into consideration,
I determined that I would have nothing further to do with the manâ€™s
unsavoury and mysterious affairs.
It was in vain, however, that I endeavoured to dismiss the matter from
my mind; and throughout the evening, which I spent at a theatre with
some American friends, I found myself constantly thinking of Adderley
and the ivory casket, of the mandarin of Johore Bahru, and of the
mystery of the shrivelled yellow hand.
I had been back in my room about half an hour, I suppose, and it was
long past midnight, when I was startled by a ringing of my telephone
bell. I took up the receiver, and:
NA
NA
NA
His words were scarcely intelligible. Undoubtedly he was in the grip of
intense emotion.

â€œIt is here, Knox, it is here! It is knocking on the door! Knocking!
NA
NA
â€œThe cur has bolted. He bolted the moment he heard that damned knocking.
NA
sound, then: â€œMy God, Knox, it is getting in! I can see... the shadow on
NA
Convinced that Adderleyâ€™s secret fears had driven him mad, I
nevertheless felt called upon to attend to his urgent call, and without
a momentâ€™s delay I hurried around to St. Jamesâ€™s Street. The liftman was
not on duty, the lower hall was in darkness, but I raced up the stairs
and found to my astonishment that Adderleyâ€™s door was wide open.
NA
There was no reply, and without further ceremony I entered and searched
the chambers. They were empty. Deeply mystified, I was about to go out
again when there came a ring at the door-bell. I walked to the door and
a policeman was standing upon the landing.
NA
NA
NA
suspicion coming into his voice.
I handed him my card and explained what had occurred, then:
NA
NA
â€œJust before you arrived, sir. He came racing out into St. Jamesâ€™s

NA
NA
*****
The neighbourhood was practically deserted at that hour. But from
the guard on duty before the palace we obtained our first evidence
of Adderleyâ€™s movements. He had raced by some five minutes before,
frantically looking back over his shoulder and behaving like a man
flying for his life. No one else had seen him. No one else ever did see
him alive. At two oâ€™clock there was no news, but I had informed Scotland
Yard and official inquiries had been set afoot.
Nothing further came to light that night, but as all readers of the
daily press will remember, Adderleyâ€™s body was taken out of the pond in
St. Jamesâ€™s Park on the following day. Death was due to drowning, but
his throat was greatly discoloured as though it had been clutched in a
fierce grip.
It was I who identified the body, and as many people will know, in spite
of the closest inquiries, the mystery of Adderleyâ€™s death has not been
properly cleared up to this day. The identity of the lady who visited
him at his chambers was never discovered. She completely disappeared.
The ebony and ivory casket lies on my table at this present moment,
visible evidence of an invisible menace from which Adderley had fled
around the world.
Doubtless the truth will never be known now. A significant discovery,
however, was made some days after the recovery of Adderleyâ€™s body.
From the bottom of the pond in St. Jamesâ€™s Park a patient Scotland
Yard official brought up the gold nail-case with its mysterious
engravings--and it contained, torn at the root, the incredibly long
finger-nail of the Mandarin Quong!
THE KEY OF THE TEMPLE OF HEAVEN
I
THE KEEPER OF THE KEY
The note of a silver bell quivered musically through the scented air of
the ante-room. Madame de Medici stirred slightly upon the divan with its
many silken cushions, turning her head toward the closed door with the
languorous, almost insolent, indifference which one perceives in the
movements of a tigress. Below, in the lobby, where the pillars of
Mokattam alabaster upheld the painted roof, the little yellow man from
Pekin shivered slightly, although the air was warm for Limehouse, and
always turned his mysterious eyes toward a corner of the great staircase
which was visible from where he sat, coiled up, a lonely figure in the
mushrabiyeh chair. Madame blew a wreath of smoke from her lips, and,
through half-closed eyes, watched it ascend, unbroken, toward the canopy
of cloth-of-gold which masked the ceiling. A Madonna by Leonardo da
Vinci faced her across the apartment, the painted figure seeming to
watch the living one upon the divan. Madame smiled into the eyes of the
Madonna. Surely even the great Leonardo must have failed to reproduce
that smile--the great Leonardo whose supreme art has captured the smile
of Mona Lisa. Madame had the smile of Cleopatra, which, it is said, made
Caesar mad, though in repose the beauty of Egyptâ€™s queen left him
cold. A robe of Kashmiri silk, fine with a phantom fineness, draped her
exquisite shape as the art of Cellini draped the classic figures which
he wrought in gold and silver; it seemed incorporate with her beauty.
A second wreath of smoke curled upward to the canopy, and Madame watched
this one also through the veil of her curved black lashes, as the
Eastern woman watches the world through her veil. Those eyes were
notable even in so lovely a setting, for they were of a hue rarely seen
in human eyes, being like the eyes of a tigress; yet they could seem
voluptuously soft, twin pools of liquid amber, in whose depths a man
might lose his soul.
Again the silver bell sounded in the ante-room, and, below, the little
yellow man shivered sympathetically. Again Madame stirred with that high
disdain that so became her, who had the eyes of a tigress. Her carmine
lips possessed the antique curve which we are told distinguished the
lips of the Comtesse de Cagliostro; her cheeks had the freshness of
flowers, and her hair the blackness of ebony, enhancing the miracle of
her skin, which had the whiteness of ivory--not of African ivory, but
of that fossil ivory which has lain for untold ages beneath the snows of
Siberia.
She dropped the cigarette from her tapered fingers into a little silver
bowl upon a table at her side, then lightly touched the bell which
stood there also. Its soft note answered to the bell in the ante-room; a
white-robed Chinese servant silently descended the great staircase,
his soft red slippers sinking into the rich pile of the carpet; and the
little yellow man from the great temple in Pekin followed him back up
the stairway and was ushered into the presence of Madame de Medici.
The servant closed the door silently and the little yellow man, fixing
his eyes upon the beautiful woman before him, fell upon his knees and
bowed his forehead to the carpet.
Madameâ€™s lovely lips curved again in the disdainful smile, and she
extended one bare ivory arm toward the visitor who knelt as a suppliant
at her feet.
NA
NA
The yellow man rose and advanced a step nearer to the divan, but the
strange beauty of Madame had spoken straight to his Eastern heart, had
awakened his soul to a new life. His glance travelled over the vision
before him, from the little Persian slipper that peeped below the
drapery of Kashmir silk to the small classic head with its crown of ebon
locks; yet he dared not meet the glance of the amber eyes.
NA
position with that languorous and lithe grace suggestive of a creature
of the jungle.
Breathing rapidly betwixt the importance of his mission and a new,
intoxicating emotion which had come upon him at the moment of entering
the perfumed room, the yellow man obeyed, but always with glance averted
from the taunting face of Madame. A golden incense-burner stood upon the
floor, over between the high, draped windows, and a faint pencil from
its dying fires stole grayly upward. Upon the scented smoke the Buddhist
priest fixed his eyes, and began, with a rapidity that grew as he
proceeded, to pour out his tale. Seated beside him, one round arm
resting upon the cushions so as almost to touch him, Madame listened,
watching the averted yellow face, and always smiling--smiling.
The tale was done at last; the incense-burner was cold, and breathlessly
the Buddhist clutched his knees with lean, clawish fingers and swayed to
and fro, striving to conquer the emotions that whirled and fought within
him. Selecting another cigarette from the box beside her, and lighting
it deliberately, Madame de Medici spoke.
NA
strange music, â€œyou come to me from your home in the secret city,
NA
She touched the bell upon the table, and the white-robed servant
reentered, and, bowing low, held open the door. The little yellow man,
first kneeling upon the carpet before the divan as before an altar,
hurried from the apartment. As the door was reclosed, and Madame found
herself alone again, she laughed lightly, as Calypso laughed when
Ulyssesâ€™ ship appeared off the shores of her isle.
God fashions few such women. It is well.
II
THE TIGER LADY
NA
NA
rather grimly.
NA
NA
NA
His glance followed the tall figure as it passed into a smaller salon on
the left; nor was he alone in his regard. Fashionable society was
well represented in the gallery--where a collection of pictures by a
celebrated artist was being shown; and prior to the entrance of the lady
in the strangely fashioned tiger-skin cloak, the somewhat extraordinary
works of art had engaged the interest even of the most fickle, but,
from the moment the tiger-lady made her appearance, even the most daring
canvases were forgotten.

of a third.
NA
While:

Judging from the isolation of the barbaric figure, it would seem that
society did not know the tiger-lady, but Deacon, seizing his companion
by the arm and almost dragging him into the small salon which the lady
had entered, turned in the doorway and looked into Annesleyâ€™s eyes.
Annesley palpably sought to evade the glance.
NA
NA
A great number of people were now thronging into the room, not so
much because of the pictures it contained, but rather out of curiosity
respecting the beautiful unknown. Annesley tried to withdraw; his
uneasiness grew momentarily greater.
NA
NA

His handsome but rather weak face was flushed; he was, as an old clubman

in cultured Englishmen, and had the frankly passionate manner which one
associates with the South. His uncle, Colonel Deacon, a mordant wit,
would say apologetically:
NA
NA
Certainly Rene was impetuous to an embarrassing degree, nor lightly to
be thwarted. Boldly meeting the glance of the woman of the amber eyes,
he pushed Annesley forward, not troubling to disguise his anxiety to be
presented to the tiger-lady. She turned her head languidly, with that
wild-animal grace of hers, and unsmiling now, regarded Annesley.

were turned upon Deacon the carmine lips curved again in the Cleopatrian
smile.
She was indeed wonderful, for while she spoke as the woman of the world
to the boy, there was nothing maternal in her patronage, and her eyes
were twin flambeaux, luring--luring, and her sweet voice was a sirenâ€™s
song.
â€œMay I beg leave to present my friend, Mr. Rene Deacon, Madame de
NA
a glance of undisguised passionate admiration, the womanâ€™s a glance
unfathomable--he slightly shrugged his shoulders and stood aside.
There were others in the salon, who, perceiving that the unknown beauty
was acquainted with Annesley, began to move from canvas to canvas toward
that end of the room where the trio stood. But Madame did not appear
anxious to make new acquaintances.

said languidly, toying with a great unset emerald which swung by a thin
gold chain about her neck. â€œMight I entreat you to take pity upon a very

Annesley seemed on the point of refusing, when:
NA
NA
There was something so like a command in the words that Deacon stared at
his companion in frank surprise. The latter avoided his glance, and:

As of old the great Catherine of her name might have withdrawn with her
suite, so now the lady of the tiger skins withdrew from the gallery, the
two men following obediently, and one of them at least a happy courtier.

TWIN POOLS OF AMBER
The white-robed Chinese servant entered and placed fresh perfume upon
the burning charcoal of the silver incense-burner. As the scented smoke
began to rise he withdrew, and a second servant entered, who facially,
in dress, in figure and bearing, was a duplicate of the first. This
one carried a large tray upon which was set an exquisite porcelain
tea-service. He placed the tray upon a low table beside the divan, and
in turn withdrew.
Deacon, seated in a great ebony chair, smoked rapidly and
nervously--looking about the strangely appointed room with its huge
picture of the Madonna, its jade Buddha surmounting a gilded Burmese
cabinet, its Persian canopy and Egyptian divan, at the thousand and
one costly curiosities which it displayed, at this mingling of East and
West, of Christianity and paganism, with a growing wonder.
To one of his blood there was delight, intoxication, in that room; but
something of apprehension, too, now grew up within him.
Madame de Medici entered. The garish motor-coat was discarded now, and
her supple figure was seen to best advantage in one of those dark
silken gowns which she affected, and which had a seeming of the
ultra-fashionable because they defied fashion. She held in her hand an
orchid, its structure that of an odontoglossum, but of a delicate green
colour heavily splashed with scarlet--a weird and unnatural-looking
bloom.
Just within the doorway she paused, as Deacon leaped up, and looked at
him through the veil of the curved lashes.
NA
gliding toward him with her tigerish step.
He spoke no word, but, face flushed, sought to look into her eyes as
she pinned the orchid in the button-hole of his coat. Her hands were
flawless in shape and colouring, being beautiful as the sculptured hands
preserved in the works of Phidias.
The slight draught occasioned by the opening of the door caused the
smoke from the incense-burner to be wafted toward the centre of the
room. Like a blue-gray phantom it coiled about the two standing there
upon a red and gold Bedouin rug, and the heavy perfume, or the close
proximity of this singularly lovely woman, wrought upon the high-strung
sensibilities of Deacon to such an extent that he was conscious of a
growing faintness.
NA

He sank on the cushioned divan, his heart beating furiously, while
Madame touched the little bell, whereupon one of the servants entered.
She spoke in Chinese, pointing to the incense-burner.
Ah Li bowed and removed the censer. As the door softly reclosed:

herself beside Deacon, she laid her hand lightly upon his arm.

NA
Madame de Medici raised a tiny cup and bent slightly toward him. He
felt that he was losing control of himself, and, averting his eyes, he
stooped and smelled the orchid in his buttonhole. Then, accepting the
cup, he was about to utter some light commonplace when the faintness
returned overwhelmingly, and, hurriedly replacing the cup upon the
tray, he fell back among the cushions. The stifling perfume of the place
seemed to be choking him.
NA
The sweet tones reached him as from a great distance; but as one dying
in the desert turns his face toward the distant oasis, Deacon turned
weakly to the speaker. She placed one fair arm behind his head,
pillowing him, and with a peacock fan which had lain amid the cushions
fanned his face. The strange scene became wholly unreal to him; he
thought himself some dying barbaric chief.
NA
The great eyes, unveiled now by the black lashes, were two twin lakes of
fairest amber. They seemed to merge together, so that he stood upon
the brink of an unfathomable amber pool--which swallowed him up--which
swallowed him up.
He awoke to an instantaneous consciousness of the fact that he had been
guilty of inexcusably bad form. He could not account for his faintness,
and reclining there amid the silken cushions, with Madame de Medici
watching him anxiously, he felt a hot flush stealing over his face.

The note of the silver bell sounded in the ante-room.

But Madame, rising to her feet, leaned lightly upon his shoulder, toying
with the petals of the orchid in his buttonhole.
NA
whispered, looking intently into his eyes, â€œand it is you who have to
NA
you have come to see me again--many, many times, you will grow to love
NA
She touched the bell upon the table, and Ah Li entered silently. When
Madame de Medici held out her hand to him Deacon raised the white
fingers to his lips and kissed them rapturously; then he turned, the
Gascon within him uppermost again, and ran from the room.
A purple curtain was drawn across the lobby, screening the caller newly
arrived from the one so hurriedly departing.
IV
THE LIVING BUDDHA
It was past midnight when Colonel Deacon returned to the house. Rene was
waiting for him, pacing up and down the big library. Their relationship
was curious, as subsisting between ward and guardian, for these two,
despite the disparity of their ages, had few secrets from one another.
Rene burned to pour out his story of the wonderful Madame de Medici, of
the secret house in Chinatown with its deceptively mean exterior and
its gorgeous interior, to the shrewd and worldly elder man. That was his
way. But Fate had an oddly bitter moment in store for him.
NA
youâ€™re home. I might not see you in the morning, and I want to tell you
NA
The words died upon Reneâ€™s lips unspoken, and he stared blankly at the
Colonel.
â€œI thought I knew all there was to know about pictures, antiques, and
NA
off-hand manner. â€œThought there werenâ€™t many men in London could teach
me anything; certainly never suspected a woman could. But Iâ€™ve met one,
boy! Gad! What a splendid creature! You know there isnâ€™t much in the
world I havenâ€™t seen--north, south, east and west. I know all the
advertised beauties of Europe and Asia--stage, opera, and ballet, and
NA
He dropped into an arm-chair, clapping both his hands upon his knees.
Rene stood at the farther end of the library, in the shadow, watching
him.
â€œSheâ€™s coming here to-morrow, boy--coming here. Gad! you dog! Youâ€™ll
fall in love with her the moment you see her--sure to, sure to! I did,
NA
NA
â€œGod knows, boy! Everybodyâ€™s mad to meet her, but nobody knows who she
is. But wait till you see her. Lady Dascot seems to be acquainted with
her, but you will see when they come to-morrow--see for yourself. Gad,

â€œEh? She calls herself Madame de Medici. Sheâ€™s a mystery, but what a
NA
Rene Deacon walked slowly upstairs, entered his bedroom, and for fully
an hour sat in the darkness, thinking--thinking.
NA
NA
He strove to recover something of the glamour which had mastered him
when in the presence of Madame de Medici, but failed. Yet he knew that,
once near her again, it would all return. His reflections were bitter,
and when at last wearily he undressed and went to bed it was to toss
restlessly far into the small hours ere sleep came to soothe his
troubled mind.
But his sleep was disturbed: a series of dreadfully realistic dreams
danced through his brain. First he seemed to be standing upon a high
mountain peak with eternal snows stretched all about him. He looked
down, past the snow line, past the fir woods, into the depths of a
lovely lake, far down in the valley below. It was a lake of liquid
amber, and as he looked it seemed to become two lakes, and they were
like two great eyes looking up at him and summoning him to leap. He
thought that he leaped, a prodigious leap, far out into space; then
fell--fell--fell. When he splashed into the amber deeps they became
churned up in a milky foam, and this closed about him with a strangle
grip. But it was no longer foam, but the clinging arms of Madame de
Medici!...
Then he stood upon a fragile bridge of bamboo spanning a raging torrent.
Right and left of the torrent below were jungles in which moved tigerish
shapes. Upon the farther side of the bridge Madame de Medici, clad in
a single garment of flame-coloured silk, beckoned to him. He sought to
cross the bridge, but it collapsed, and he fell near the edge of the
torrent. Below were the raging waters, and ever nearing him the tigerish
shapes, which now Madame was calling to as to a pack of hounds. They
were about to devour him, when------
He was crouching upon a ledge, high above a street which seemed to be
vaguely familiar. He could not see very well, because of a silk mask
tied upon his face, and the eyeholes of which were badly cut. From the
ledge he stepped to another, perilously. He gained it, and crouching
there, where there was scarce foothold for a cat, he managed fully to
raise a window which already was raised some six inches. Then softly and
silently--for he was bare-footed--he entered the room.
Someone slept in a bed facing the window by which he had entered, and
upon a table at the side of the sleeper lay a purse, a bunch of keys, an
electric torch, and a Service revolver. Gliding to the table Rene took
the keys and the electric torch, unlocked the door of the room, and
crept down a thickly carpeted stair to a room below. The door of this
also he opened with one of the keys in the bunch, and by the light of
the torch found his way through a quantity of antique furniture and
piled up curiosities to a safe set in the farther wall.
He seemed, in his dream, to be familiar with the lock combination, and,
selecting the correct key from the bunch, he soon had the safe open.
The shelves within were laden principally with antique jewellery,
statuettes, medals, scarabs; and a number of little leather-covered
boxes were there also. One of these he abstracted, relocked the safe,
and stepped out of the room, locking the door behind him. Up the stairs
he mounted to the bedroom wherein he had left the sleeper. Having
entered, he locked the door from within, placed the keys and the torch
upon the table, and crept out again upon the dizzy ledge.
Poised there, high above the thoroughfare below, a great nausea attacked
him. Glancing to the right, in the direction of the window through which
he had come, he perceived Madame de Medici leaning out and beckoning to
him. Her arm gleamed whitely in the faint light. A new courage came to
him. He succeeded, crouched there upon the narrow ledge, in relowering
the window, and leaving it in the state in which he had found it, he
stood up and essayed that sickly stride to the adjoining ledge. He
accomplished it, knelt, and crept back into the room from which he had
started....
The head of an ivory image of Buddha loomed up out of the utter
darkness, growing and growing until it seemed like a great mountain. He
could not believe that there was so much ivory in the world, and he felt
it with his fingers, wonderingly. As he did so it began to shrink, and
shrink, and shrink, and shrink, until it was no larger than a seated
human figure. Then beneath his trembling hands it became animate; it
moved, extended ivory arms, and wrapped them about his neck. Its lips
became carmine--perfumed; they bent to him... and he was looking into
the bewitching face of Madame de Medici!
He awoke, gasping for air and bathed in cold perspiration. The dawn was
just breaking over London and stealing grayly from object to object in
his bedroom.
V
THE IVORY GOD
The great car, with its fittings of gold and ivory, drew up at the door
of Colonel Deaconâ€™s house. The interior was ablaze with tiger lilies,
and out from their midst stepped the fairest of them all--Madame de
Medici, and swept queenly up the steps upon the arm of the cavalierly
soldier.
All connoisseurs esteemed it a privilege to view the Deacon collection,
and this afternoon there was a goodly gathering. Chairs and little white
tables were dotted about the lawn in shady spots, and the majority of
the company were already assembled; but when, in a wonderful golden
robe, Madame de Medici glided across the lawn, the babel ceased abruptly
as if by magic. She pulled off one glove and began twirling a great
emerald between her slim fingers. It was suspended from a thin gold
chain. Presently, descrying Annesley seated at a table with Lady Dascot,
she raised the jewel languidly and peered through it at the two.
NA
NA
Madame laughed musically.
NA
NA
Colonel Deacon, who listened to her every word as to the utterance of a
Cumaean oracle, laughed with extraordinary approbation.
There was scarce a woman present who regarded Madame with a friendly
eye, nor a man who did not aspire to become her devoted slave. She
brought an atmosphere of unreality with her, dominating old and young
alike by virtue of her splendid pagan beauty. The lawn, with its very
modern appointments, became as some garden of the Golden House, a
pleasure ground of an emperor.
But later, when the company entered the house, and Colonel Deacon sought
to monopolize the society of Madame, an unhealthy spirit of jealousy
arose between Rene and his guardian. It was strange, grotesque, horrible
almost. Annesley watched from afar, and there was something very like
anger in his glance.

She shrugged her shoulders.

Rene started slightly and watched with intense interest the unlocking of
the safe.

NA

The Colonel, having unlocked the safe, straightened himself, and while
everyone was waiting to see what he had to show, began to speak again
pompously:
â€œThe Temple of Heaven stands in the outer or Chinese City of Pekin, and
is fabulously wealthy. No European, I can swear, had ever entered its
secret chambers until last year. One of its most famous treasures was
this Key. It was used only to open the special entrance reserved for the
Emperor when he came to worship after his succession to the throne--that
was, of course, before China became a Republic. The Key is studded
almost all over with precious stones. Last year a certain naval
man--Iâ€™ll not mention his name--discovered the secret of its
hiding-place. How he came by that knowledge does not matter at present.
One very dark night he crept up to the temple. He found the Keeper of
the Key--a Buddhist priest--to be sleeping, and he succeeded, therefore,

A chorus of excited exclamations greeted this dramatic point of the
story.
NA
I cannot deny it to have been, was not a romantic one. The poor chap
wanted money, and he thought he could sell the Key to one of the native
jewellers. But he was mistaken. He got back safely, and secretly offered
it in various directions. No one would touch the thing; moreover,
although of great value, the stones were very far from flawless, and
not really worth the risks which he had run to secure them. Donâ€™t

â€œHe packed it up and addressed it to me, together with a letter. The
price that he asked was quite a moderate one, and when the Key arrived

NA
NA

The Colonel stooped and reached into the safe. Then he began to take
out object after object, box after box. Finally, he straightened himself
again, and all saw that his face was oddly blanched.

VI
MADAME SMILES
Rene entered his bedroom, locked the door, and seated himself on the
bed; then he lowered his head into his hands and clutched at his hair
distractedly. Since, on his uncleâ€™s own showing, no one knew that the
Key of the Temple of Heaven had been in the safe, since, excepting
himself (Rene) and the Colonel, no one else knew the lock combination,
how the Key had been stolen was a mystery which defied conjecture. No
one but the Colonel had approached within several yards of the safe at
the time it was opened; so that clearly the theft had been committed
prior to that time.
Now Rene sought to recall the details of a strange dream which he had
dreamed immediately before awakening on the previous night; but he
sought in vain. His memory could supply only blurred images. There had
been a safe in his dream, and he--was it he or another?--had unlocked
it. Also there had been an enormous ivory Buddha.... Yet, stay! it had
not been enormous; it had been...
He groaned at his own impotency to recall the circumstances of that
mysterious, perhaps prophetic dream; then in despair he gave it up, and
stooping to a little secretaire, unlocked it with the idea of sending a
note round to Annesleyâ€™s chambers. As he did so he uttered a loud cry.
Lying in one of the pigeon-holes was a long piece of black silk,
apparently torn from the lining of an opera hat. In it two holes were
cut as if it were intended to be used as a mask. Beside it lay a little
leather-covered box. He snatched it out and opened it. It was empty!

It was the butler who had interrupted him. Rene descended to the
telephone, dazedly, but, recognizing the voice of Annesley, roused
himself.

you never to mention my name in the matter. Avoid the woman who calls
herself Madame de Medici; sheâ€™ll break you. Sheâ€™s an adventuress, and

â€œItâ€™s the theft of the Key that has prompted me to speak, Deacon. Madame

my cost! Paul Harley, of Chancery Lane, can tell you more about her.
The house sheâ€™s living in temporarily used to belong to a notorious
Eurasian, Zani Chada. To make a clean breast of it I darenâ€™t thwart her
openly; but I felt it up to me to tell you that she possesses the secret

As Madame de Mediciâ€™s car drove off from the house of Colonel Deacon,
and Madame seated herself in the cushioned corner, up from amid the furs
upon the floor, where, dog-like, he had lain concealed, rose the little
yellow man from the Temple of Heaven. He extended eager hands toward
her, kneeling there, and spoke:
NA
Madame held in her hand an ivory Buddha. Inverting it she unscrewed the
pedestal, and out from the hollow inside the image dropped a gleaming
Key.
NA
disdainfully raised her right hand which held the treasure, and with her
left hand thrust down the clutching yellow fingers.
She dropped the Key between her white skin and the bodice of her gown,
tossing the ivory figure contemptuously amid the fur.
NA
with the flame of fanaticism. He slowly uprose, a sinister figure, and
with distended fingers prepared to seize Madame by the throat. His eyes
were bloodshot, his nostrils were dilated, and his teeth were exposed
like the fangs of a wolf.
But she pulled off her glove and stretched out her bare white hand to
him as a queen to a subject; she raised the long curved lashes, and the
great amber eyes looked into the angry bloodshot eyes.
The little yellow man began to breathe more and more rapidly; soon he
was panting like one in a fight to the death who is all but conquered.
At last he dropped on his knees amid the fur... and the curling lashes
were lowered again over the blazing amber eyes that had conquered.
Madame de Medici lowered her beautiful white hand, and the little yellow
man seized it in both his own and showered rapturous kisses upon it.
Madame smiled slightly.
