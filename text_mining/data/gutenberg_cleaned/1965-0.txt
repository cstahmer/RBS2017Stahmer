CHAPTER I. THE MESSENGER
Peter Blood, bachelor of medicine and several other things besides,
smoked a pipe and tended the geraniums boxed on the sill of his window
above Water Lane in the town of Bridgewater.
Sternly disapproving eyes considered him from a window opposite, but
went disregarded. Mr. Bloodâ€™s attention was divided between his task and
the stream of humanity in the narrow street below; a stream which poured
for the second time that day towards Castle Field, where earlier in
the afternoon Ferguson, the Dukeâ€™s chaplain, had preached a sermon
containing more treason than divinity.
These straggling, excited groups were mainly composed of men with green
boughs in their hats and the most ludicrous of weapons in their hands.
Some, it is true, shouldered fowling pieces, and here and there a sword
was brandished; but more of them were armed with clubs, and most of them
trailed the mammoth pikes fashioned out of scythes, as formidable to
the eye as they were clumsy to the hand. There were weavers, brewers,
carpenters, smiths, masons, bricklayers, cobblers, and representatives
of every other of the trades of peace among these improvised men of war.
Bridgewater, like Taunton, had yielded so generously of its manhood to
the service of the bastard Duke that for any to abstain whose age and
strength admitted of his bearing arms was to brand himself a coward or a
papist.
Yet Peter Blood, who was not only able to bear arms, but trained and
skilled in their use, who was certainly no coward, and a papist only
when it suited him, tended his geraniums and smoked his pipe on that
warm July evening as indifferently as if nothing were afoot. One other
thing he did. He flung after those war-fevered enthusiasts a line of
Horace--a poet for whose work he had early conceived an inordinate
affection:
NA
And now perhaps you guess why the hot, intrepid blood inherited from the
roving sires of his Somersetshire mother remained cool amidst all this
frenzied fanatical heat of rebellion; why the turbulent spirit which had
forced him once from the sedate academical bonds his father would
have imposed upon him, should now remain quiet in the very midst of
turbulence. You realize how he regarded these men who were rallying to
the banners of liberty--the banners woven by the virgins of Taunton, the
girls from the seminaries of Miss Blake and Mrs. Musgrove, who--as the
ballad runs--had ripped open their silk petticoats to make colours for
King Monmouthâ€™s army. That Latin line, contemptuously flung after them
as they clattered down the cobbled street, reveals his mind. To him they
were fools rushing in wicked frenzy upon their ruin.
You see, he knew too much about this fellow Monmouth and the pretty
brown slut who had borne him, to be deceived by the legend of
legitimacy, on the strength of which this standard of rebellion had
been raised. He had read the absurd proclamation posted at the Cross
at Bridgewater--as it had been posted also at Taunton and
elsewhere--setting forth that â€œupon the decease of our Sovereign Lord
Charles the Second, the right of succession to the Crown of England,
Scotland, France, and Ireland, with the dominions and territories
thereunto belonging, did legally descend and devolve upon the most
illustrious and high-born Prince James, Duke of Monmouth, son and heir
NA
It had moved him to laughter, as had the further announcement that
â€œJames Duke of York did first cause the said late King to be poysoned,
NA
He knew not which was the greater lie. For Mr. Blood had spent a third
of his life in the Netherlands, where this same James Scott--who now
proclaimed himself James the Second, by the grace of God, King, et
cetera--first saw the light some six-and-thirty years ago, and he was
acquainted with the story current there of the fellowâ€™s real paternity.
Far from being legitimate--by virtue of a pretended secret marriage
between Charles Stuart and Lucy Walter--it was possible that this
Monmouth who now proclaimed himself King of England was not even the
illegitimate child of the late sovereign. What but ruin and disaster
could be the end of this grotesque pretension? How could it be hoped
that England would ever swallow such a Perkin? And it was on his behalf,
to uphold his fantastic claim, that these West Country clods, led by a
few armigerous Whigs, had been seduced into rebellion!
NA
He laughed and sighed in one; but the laugh dominated the sigh, for Mr.
Blood was unsympathetic, as are most self-sufficient men; and he
was very self-sufficient; adversity had taught him so to be. A more
tender-hearted man, possessing his vision and his knowledge, might have
found cause for tears in the contemplation of these ardent, simple,
Nonconformist sheep going forth to the shambles--escorted to the
rallying ground on Castle Field by wives and daughters, sweethearts and
mothers, sustained by the delusion that they were to take the field
in defence of Right, of Liberty, and of Religion. For he knew, as
all Bridgewater knew and had known now for some hours, that it was
Monmouthâ€™s intention to deliver battle that same night. The Duke was to
lead a surprise attack upon the Royalist army under Feversham that was
now encamped on Sedgemoor. Mr. Blood assumed that Lord Feversham would
be equally well-informed, and if in this assumption he was wrong,
at least he was justified of it. He was not to suppose the Royalist
commander so indifferently skilled in the trade he followed.
Mr. Blood knocked the ashes from his pipe, and drew back to close his
window. As he did so, his glance travelling straight across the street
met at last the glance of those hostile eyes that watched him. There
were two pairs, and they belonged to the Misses Pitt, two amiable,
sentimental maiden ladies who yielded to none in Bridgewater in their
worship of the handsome Monmouth.
Mr. Blood smiled and inclined his head, for he was on friendly terms
with these ladies, one of whom, indeed, had been for a little while his
patient. But there was no response to his greeting. Instead, the eyes
gave him back a stare of cold disdain. The smile on his thin lips grew a
little broader, a little less pleasant. He understood the reason of that
hostility, which had been daily growing in this past week since Monmouth
had come to turn the brains of women of all ages. The Misses Pitt,
he apprehended, contemned him that he, a young and vigorous man, of a
military training which might now be valuable to the Cause, should stand
aloof; that he should placidly smoke his pipe and tend his geraniums on
this evening of all evenings, when men of spirit were rallying to the
Protestant Champion, offering their blood to place him on the throne
where he belonged.
If Mr. Blood had condescended to debate the matter with these ladies, he
might have urged that having had his fill of wandering and adventuring,
he was now embarked upon the career for which he had been originally
intended and for which his studies had equipped him; that he was a man
of medicine and not of war; a healer, not a slayer. But they would have
answered him, he knew, that in such a cause it behoved every man who
deemed himself a man to take up arms. They would have pointed out that
their own nephew Jeremiah, who was by trade a sailor, the master of a
ship--which by an ill-chance for that young man had come to anchor at
this season in Bridgewater Bay--had quitted the helm to snatch up a
musket in defence of Right. But Mr. Blood was not of those who argue. As
I have said, he was a self-sufficient man.
He closed the window, drew the curtains, and turned to the pleasant,
candle-lighted room, and the table on which Mrs. Barlow, his
housekeeper, was in the very act of spreading supper. To her, however,
he spoke aloud his thought.
NA
He had a pleasant, vibrant voice, whose metallic ring was softened and
muted by the Irish accent which in all his wanderings he had never lost.
It was a voice that could woo seductively and caressingly, or command in
such a way as to compel obedience. Indeed, the manâ€™s whole nature was in
that voice of his. For the rest of him, he was tall and spare, swarthy
of tint as a gipsy, with eyes that were startlingly blue in that dark
face and under those level black brows. In their glance those eyes,
flanking a high-bridged, intrepid nose, were of singular penetration
and of a steady haughtiness that went well with his firm lips. Though
dressed in black as became his calling, yet it was with an elegance
derived from the love of clothes that is peculiar to the adventurer he
had been, rather than to the staid medicus he now was. His coat was of
fine camlet, and it was laced with silver; there were ruffles of Mechlin
at his wrists and a Mechlin cravat encased his throat. His great black
periwig was as sedulously curled as any at Whitehall.
Seeing him thus, and perceiving his real nature, which was plain upon
him, you might have been tempted to speculate how long such a man would
be content to lie by in this little backwater of the world into which
chance had swept him some six months ago; how long he would continue to
pursue the trade for which he had qualified himself before he had begun
to live. Difficult of belief though it may be when you know his history,
previous and subsequent, yet it is possible that but for the trick
that Fate was about to play him, he might have continued this peaceful
existence, settling down completely to the life of a doctor in this
Somersetshire haven. It is possible, but not probable.
He was the son of an Irish medicus, by a Somersetshire lady in whose
veins ran the rover blood of the Frobishers, which may account for a
certain wildness that had early manifested itself in his disposition.
This wildness had profoundly alarmed his father, who for an Irishman was
of a singularly peace-loving nature. He had early resolved that the
boy should follow his own honourable profession, and Peter Blood, being
quick to learn and oddly greedy of knowledge, had satisfied his parent
by receiving at the age of twenty the degree of baccalaureus medicinae
at Trinity College, Dublin. His father survived that satisfaction by
three months only. His mother had then been dead some years already.
Thus Peter Blood came into an inheritance of some few hundred pounds,
with which he had set out to see the world and give for a season a free
rein to that restless spirit by which he was imbued. A set of curious
chances led him to take service with the Dutch, then at war with France;
and a predilection for the sea made him elect that this service should
be upon that element. He had the advantage of a commission under the
famous de Ruyter, and fought in the Mediterranean engagement in which
that great Dutch admiral lost his life.
After the Peace of Nimeguen his movements are obscure. But we know that
he spent two years in a Spanish prison, though we do not know how he
contrived to get there. It may be due to this that upon his release
he took his sword to France, and saw service with the French in their
warring upon the Spanish Netherlands. Having reached, at last, the age
of thirty-two, his appetite for adventure surfeited, his health having
grown indifferent as the result of a neglected wound, he was suddenly
overwhelmed by homesickness. He took ship from Nantes with intent to
cross to Ireland. But the vessel being driven by stress of weather
into Bridgewater Bay, and Bloodâ€™s health having grown worse during the
voyage, he decided to go ashore there, additionally urged to it by the
fact that it was his motherâ€™s native soil.
Thus in January of that year 1685 he had come to Bridgewater, possessor
of a fortune that was approximately the same as that with which he had
originally set out from Dublin eleven years ago.
Because he liked the place, in which his health was rapidly restored
to him, and because he conceived that he had passed through adventures
enough for a manâ€™s lifetime, he determined to settle there, and take
up at last the profession of medicine from which he had, with so little
profit, broken away.
That is all his story, or so much of it as matters up to that night, six
months later, when the battle of Sedgemoor was fought.
Deeming the impending action no affair of his, as indeed it was not, and
indifferent to the activity with which Bridgewater was that night agog,
Mr. Blood closed his ears to the sounds of it, and went early to bed. He
was peacefully asleep long before eleven oâ€™clock, at which hour, as
you know, Monmouth rode but with his rebel host along the Bristol Road,
circuitously to avoid the marshland that lay directly between himself
and the Royal Army. You also know that his numerical advantage--possibly
counter-balanced by the greater steadiness of the regular troops on the
other side--and the advantages he derived from falling by surprise upon
an army that was more or less asleep, were all lost to him by blundering
and bad leadership before ever he was at grips with Feversham.
The armies came into collision in the neighbourhood of two oâ€™clock in
the morning. Mr. Blood slept undisturbed through the distant boom of
cannon. Not until four oâ€™clock, when the sun was rising to dispel the
last wisps of mist over that stricken field of battle, did he awaken
from his tranquil slumbers.
He sat up in bed, rubbed the sleep from his eyes, and collected himself.
Blows were thundering upon the door of his house, and a voice was
calling incoherently. This was the noise that had aroused him.
Conceiving that he had to do with some urgent obstetrical case, he
reached for bedgown and slippers, to go below. On the landing he almost
collided with Mrs. Barlow, new-risen and unsightly, in a state of panic.
He quieted her cluckings with a word of reassurance, and went himself to
open.
There in slanting golden light of the new-risen sun stood a breathless,
wild-eyed man and a steaming horse. Smothered in dust and grime, his
clothes in disarray, the left sleeve of his doublet hanging in rags,
this young man opened his lips to speak, yet for a long moment remained
speechless.
In that moment Mr. Blood recognized him for the young shipmaster,
Jeremiah Pitt, the nephew of the maiden ladies opposite, one who had
been drawn by the general enthusiasm into the vortex of that rebellion.
The street was rousing, awakened by the sailorâ€™s noisy advent; doors
were opening, and lattices were being unlatched for the protrusion of
anxious, inquisitive heads.
NA
NA
But the wild-eyed lad paid no heed to the admonition. He plunged,
headlong, into speech, gasping, breathless.
NA
Farm by the river. I bore him thither... and... and he sent me for you.
NA
He would have clutched the doctor, and haled him forth by force in
bedgown and slippers as he was. But the doctor eluded that too eager
hand.
NA
very friendly, generous patron to him since his settling in these parts.
And Mr. Blood was eager enough to do what he now could to discharge
the debt, grieved that the occasion should have arisen, and in such a
manner--for he knew quite well that the rash young nobleman had been an
active agent of the Dukeâ€™s. â€œTo be sure, Iâ€™ll come. But first give me
NA
NA
â€œBe easy now. Iâ€™ll lose none. I tell ye again, yeâ€™ll go quickest by
NA
parlour.
Young Pitt waved aside the invitation.
NA
and to fetch a case of instruments.
Questions concerning the precise nature of Lord Gildoyâ€™s hurt could wait
until they were on their way. Whilst he pulled on his boots, he gave
Mrs. Barlow instructions for the day, which included the matter of a
dinner he was not destined to eat.
When at last he went forth again, Mrs. Barlow clucking after him like
a disgruntled fowl, he found young Pitt smothered in a crowd of scared,
half-dressed townsfolk--mostly women--who had come hastening for news
of how the battle had sped. The news he gave them was to be read in the
lamentations with which they disturbed the morning air.
At sight of the doctor, dressed and booted, the case of instruments
tucked under his arm, the messenger disengaged himself from those who
pressed about, shook off his weariness and the two tearful aunts that
clung most closely, and seizing the bridle of his horse, he climbed to
the saddle.
NA
Mr. Blood, without wasting words, did as he was bidden. Pitt touched
the horse with his spur. The little crowd gave way, and thus, upon
the crupper of that doubly-laden horse, clinging to the belt of his
companion, Peter Blood set out upon his Odyssey. For this Pitt, in whom
he beheld no more than the messenger of a wounded rebel gentleman, was
indeed the very messenger of Fate.
CHAPTER II. KIRKEâ€™S DRAGOONS
Oglethorpeâ€™s farm stood a mile or so to the south of Bridgewater on the
right bank of the river. It was a straggling Tudor building showing grey
above the ivy that clothed its lower parts. Approaching it now, through
the fragrant orchards amid which it seemed to drowse in Arcadian peace
beside the waters of the Parrett, sparkling in the morning sunlight,
Mr. Blood might have had a difficulty in believing it part of a world
tormented by strife and bloodshed.
On the bridge, as they had been riding out of Bridgewater, they had met
a vanguard of fugitives from the field of battle, weary, broken men,
many of them wounded, all of them terror-stricken, staggering in
speedless haste with the last remnants of their strength into the
shelter which it was their vain illusion the town would afford them.
Eyes glazed with lassitude and fear looked up piteously out of haggard
faces at Mr. Blood and his companion as they rode forth; hoarse voices
cried a warning that merciless pursuit was not far behind. Undeterred,
however, young Pitt rode amain along the dusty road by which these
poor fugitives from that swift rout on Sedgemoor came flocking in
ever-increasing numbers. Presently he swung aside, and quitting the road
took to a pathway that crossed the dewy meadowlands. Even here they
met odd groups of these human derelicts, who were scattering in all
directions, looking fearfully behind them as they came through the long
grass, expecting at every moment to see the red coats of the dragoons.
But as Pittâ€™s direction was a southward one, bringing them ever nearer
to Fevershamâ€™s headquarters, they were presently clear of that human
flotsam and jetsam of the battle, and riding through the peaceful
orchards heavy with the ripening fruit that was soon to make its annual
yield of cider.
At last they alighted on the kidney stones of the courtyard, and Baynes,
the master, of the homestead, grave of countenance and flustered of
manner, gave them welcome.
In the spacious, stone-flagged hall, the doctor found Lord
Gildoy--a very tall and dark young gentleman, prominent of chin and
nose--stretched on a cane day-bed under one of the tall mullioned
windows, in the care of Mrs. Baynes and her comely daughter. His cheeks
were leaden-hued, his eyes closed, and from his blue lips came with each
laboured breath a faint, moaning noise.
Mr. Blood stood for a moment silently considering his patient. He
deplored that a youth with such bright hopes in life as Lord Gildoyâ€™s
should have risked all, perhaps existence itself, to forward the
ambition of a worthless adventurer. Because he had liked and honoured
this brave lad he paid his case the tribute of a sigh. Then he knelt to
his task, ripped away doublet and underwear to lay bare his lordshipâ€™s
mangled side, and called for water and linen and what else he needed for
his work.
He was still intent upon it a half-hour later when the dragoons invaded
the homestead. The clatter of hooves and hoarse shouts that heralded
their approach disturbed him not at all. For one thing, he was not
easily disturbed; for another, his task absorbed him. But his lordship,
who had now recovered consciousness, showed considerable alarm, and the
battle-stained Jeremy Pitt sped to cover in a clothes-press. Baynes was
uneasy, and his wife and daughter trembled. Mr. Blood reassured them.
NA
Christian men do not make war upon the wounded, nor upon those who
NA
He held a glass of cordial, prepared under his directions, to his
NA
And then they came rattling and clanking into the stone-flagged hall--a
round dozen jack-booted, lobster-coated troopers of the Tangiers
Regiment, led by a sturdy, black-browed fellow with a deal of gold lace
about the breast of his coat.
Baynes stood his ground, his attitude half-defiant, whilst his wife
and daughter shrank away in renewed fear. Mr. Blood, at the head of the
day-bed, looked over his shoulder to take stock of the invaders.
The officer barked an order, which brought his men to an attentive halt,
then swaggered forward, his gloved hand bearing down the pummel of
his sword, his spurs jingling musically as he moved. He announced his
authority to the yeoman.
â€œI am Captain Hobart, of Colonel Kirkeâ€™s dragoons. What rebels do you
NA
The yeoman took alarm at that ferocious truculence. It expressed itself
in his trembling voice.
NA
NA
scowled down upon the grey-faced sufferer.
â€œNo need to ask how he came in this state and by his wounds. A damned

NA
Mr. Blood got between the day-bed and the troopers.
NA

NA
Captain Hobart was amused.
â€œOh, I am to be tender of the lives of these rebels! Odds blood! Do you
think itâ€™s to benefit his health weâ€™re taking him? Thereâ€™s gallows being
planted along the road from Weston to Bridgewater, and heâ€™ll serve
for one of them as well as another. Colonel Kirkeâ€™ll learn these
NA
â€œYouâ€™re hanging men without trial? Faith, then, itâ€™s mistaken I am.
NA
The Captain considered him with a kindling eye. He looked him over from
the soles of his riding-boots to the crown of his periwig. He noted
the spare, active frame, the arrogant poise of the head, the air of
authority that invested Mr. Blood, and soldier recognized soldier. The
Captainâ€™s eyes narrowed. Recognition went further.
NA
NA
â€œAye--aye! Codso! Thatâ€™s the name. You were in French service once, were

If Mr. Blood was surprised, he did not betray it.

Mr. Bloodâ€™s smile annoyed him.
NA
The Captain sneered. â€œWhich you reached by way of Lyme Regis in the

It was Mr. Bloodâ€™s turn to sneer. â€œIf your wit were as big as your

For a moment the dragoon was speechless. The colour deepened in his
face.
NA
â€œFaith, yes. Yeâ€™ve the look and the manners of a hangman. But if you
practise your trade on my patient here, you may be putting a rope round
your own neck. Heâ€™s not the kind you may string up and no questions
NA
NA
The Captain was taken aback by these three words, which Mr. Blood had
stressed.
â€œSure, now, any but a fool or a savage would have asked his name before
NA
And then his lordship spoke for himself, in a weak voice.
â€œI make no concealment of my association with the Duke of Monmouth.
Iâ€™ll take the consequences. But, if you please, Iâ€™ll take them after
NA
The feeble voice ceased, and was followed by a momentâ€™s silence. As is
common in many blustering men, there was a deal of timidity deep down
in Hobart. The announcement of his lordshipâ€™s rank had touched those
depths. A servile upstart, he stood in awe of titles. And he stood in
awe of his colonel. Percy Kirke was not lenient with blunderers.
By a gesture he checked his men. He must consider. Mr. Blood, observing
his pause, added further matter for his consideration.
â€œYeâ€™ll be remembering, Captain, that Lord Gildoy will have friends and
relatives on the Tory side, whoâ€™ll have something to say to Colonel
Kirke if his lordship should be handled like a common felon. Youâ€™ll go
warily, Captain, or, as Iâ€™ve said, itâ€™s a halter for your neck yeâ€™ll be

Captain Hobart swept the warning aside with a bluster of contempt, but
NA

NA
NA
NA
confirmed his order by a gesture. Two of his men took up the day-bed,
and swung to depart with it.
Gildoy made a feeble effort to put forth a hand towards Mr. Blood.
NA
NA
NA
NA
As his lordship was carried out, the Captain became brisk. He turned
upon the yeoman.
NA
NA
â€œWeâ€™ve dealt with his lordship for the present. Weâ€™ll deal with you in
a moment when weâ€™ve searched your house. And, by God, if youâ€™ve lied to

went out. In a moment they were heard moving noisily in the adjacent
room. Meanwhile, the Captain was questing about the hall, sounding the
wainscoting with the butt of a pistol.
Mr. Blood saw no profit to himself in lingering.
NA
NA
NA
NA
But the Captain did not heed him. He was stooping to pick up a soiled
and dusty hat in which there was pinned a little bunch of oak leaves. It
had been lying near the clothes-press in which the unfortunate Pitt had
taken refuge. The Captain smiled malevolently. His eyes raked the room,
resting first sardonically on the yeoman, then on the two women in the
background, and finally on Mr. Blood, who sat with one leg thrown over
the other in an attitude of indifference that was far from reflecting
his mind.
Then the Captain stepped to the press, and pulled open one of the wings
of its massive oaken door. He took the huddled inmate by the collar of
his doublet, and lugged him out into the open.
NA
Mr. Blood had a vision of those gallows of which Captain Hobart had
spoken, and of this unfortunate young shipmaster going to adorn one of
them, strung up without trial, in the place of the other victim of whom
the Captain had been cheated. On the spot he invented not only a title
but a whole family for the young rebel.
â€œFaith, yeâ€™ve said it, Captain. This is Viscount Pitt, first cousin to
Sir Thomas Vernon, whoâ€™s married to that slut Moll Kirke, sister to your
NA
Both the Captain and his prisoner gasped. But whereas thereafter young
Pitt discreetly held his peace, the Captain rapped out a nasty oath. He
considered his prisoner again.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
 He thrust the lad into the hands of his men. â€œFetch him along to
NA
NA
There was a moment of confusion. Baynes struggled in the grip of the
troopers, protesting vehemently. The terrified women screamed until
silenced by a greater terror. The Captain strode across to them. He took
the girl by the shoulders. She was a pretty, golden-headed creature,
with soft blue eyes that looked up entreatingly, piteously into the face
of the dragoon. He leered upon her, his eyes aglow, took her chin in his
hand, and set her shuddering by his brutal kiss.
NA
NA
And he swung away again, leaving her faint and trembling in the arms of
her anguished mother. His men stood, grinning, awaiting orders, the two
prisoners now fast pinioned.

NA
NA
Mr. Blood started out of his musings. He had been considering that in
his case of instruments there was a lancet with which he might perform
on Captain Hobart a beneficial operation. Beneficial, that is, to
humanity. In any case, the dragoon was obviously plethoric and would
be the better for a blood-letting. The difficulty lay in making the
opportunity. He was beginning to wonder if he could lure the Captain
aside with some tale of hidden treasure, when this untimely interruption
set a term to that interesting speculation.
He sought to temporize.

â€œThereâ€™s a gallows for you if you prefer it. Itâ€™s merely a question of

Rude hands seized Mr. Blood, and that precious lancet was in the case on
the table out of reach. He twisted out of the grip of the dragoons, for
he was strong and agile, but they closed with him again immediately, and
bore him down. Pinning him to the ground, they tied his wrists behind
his back, then roughly pulled him to his feet again.
NA
the other waiting troopers. â€œGo search the house, from attic to cellar;
NA
The soldiers trailed out by the door leading to the interior. Mr. Blood
was thrust by his guards into the courtyard, where Pitt and Baynes
already waited. From the threshold of the hall, he looked back at
Captain Hobart, and his sapphire eyes were blazing. On his lips trembled
a threat of what he would do to Hobart if he should happen to survive
this business. Betimes he remembered that to utter it were probably to
extinguish his chance of living to execute it. For to-day the Kingâ€™s men
were masters in the West, and the West was regarded as enemy country, to
be subjected to the worst horror of war by the victorious side. Here a
captain of horse was for the moment lord of life and death.
Under the apple-trees in the orchard Mr. Blood and his companions in
misfortune were made fast each to a trooperâ€™s stirrup leather. Then at
the sharp order of the cornet, the little troop started for Bridgewater.
As they set out there was the fullest confirmation of Mr. Bloodâ€™s
hideous assumption that to the dragoons this was a conquered enemy
country. There were sounds of rending timbers, of furniture smashed and
overthrown, the shouts and laughter of brutal men, to announce that this
hunt for rebels was no more than a pretext for pillage and destruction.
Finally above all other sounds came the piercing screams of a woman in
acutest agony.
Baynes checked in his stride, and swung round writhing, his face ashen.
As a consequence he was jerked from his feet by the rope that attached
him to the stirrup leather, and he was dragged helplessly a yard or two
before the trooper reined in, cursing him foully, and striking him with
the flat of his sword.
It came to Mr. Blood, as he trudged forward under the laden apple-trees
on that fragrant, delicious July morning, that man--as he had long
suspected--was the vilest work of God, and that only a fool would set
himself up as a healer of a species that was best exterminated.
CHAPTER III. THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE
It was not until two months later--on the 19th of September, if you
must have the actual date--that Peter Blood was brought to trial, upon
a charge of high treason. We know that he was not guilty of this; but
we need not doubt that he was quite capable of it by the time he was
indicted. Those two months of inhuman, unspeakable imprisonment had
moved his mind to a cold and deadly hatred of King James and his
representatives. It says something for his fortitude that in all the
circumstances he should still have had a mind at all. Yet, terrible
as was the position of this entirely innocent man, he had cause for
thankfulness on two counts. The first of these was that he should have
been brought to trial at all; the second, that his trial took place
on the date named, and not a day earlier. In the very delay which
exacerbated him lay--although he did not realize it--his only chance of
avoiding the gallows.
Easily, but for the favour of Fortune, he might have been one of those
haled, on the morrow of the battle, more or less haphazard from
the overflowing gaol at Bridgewater to be summarily hanged in the
market-place by the bloodthirsty Colonel Kirke. There was about the
Colonel of the Tangiers Regiment a deadly despatch which might have
disposed in like fashion of all those prisoners, numerous as they were,
but for the vigorous intervention of Bishop Mews, which put an end to
the drumhead courts-martial.
Even so, in that first week after Sedgemoor, Kirke and Feversham
contrived between them to put to death over a hundred men after a trial
so summary as to be no trial at all. They required human freights for
the gibbets with which they were planting the countryside, and they
little cared how they procured them or what innocent lives they took.
What, after all, was the life of a clod? The executioners were kept busy
with rope and chopper and cauldrons of pitch. I spare you the details of
that nauseating picture. It is, after all, with the fate of Peter Blood
that we are concerned rather than with that of the Monmouth rebels.
He survived to be included in one of those melancholy droves of
prisoners who, chained in pairs, were marched from Bridgewater to
Taunton. Those who were too sorely wounded to march were conveyed in
carts, into which they were brutally crowded, their wounds undressed and
festering. Many were fortunate enough to die upon the way. When Blood
insisted upon his right to exercise his art so as to relieve some of
this suffering, he was accounted importunate and threatened with a
flogging. If he had one regret now it was that he had not been out with
Monmouth. That, of course, was illogical; but you can hardly expect
logic from a man in his position.
His chain companion on that dreadful march was the same Jeremy Pitt who
had been the agent of his present misfortunes. The young shipmaster
had remained his close companion after their common arrest. Hence,
fortuitously, had they been chained together in the crowded prison,
where they were almost suffocated by the heat and the stench during
those days of July, August, and September.
Scraps of news filtered into the gaol from the outside world. Some may
have been deliberately allowed to penetrate. Of these was the tale of
Monmouthâ€™s execution. It created profoundest dismay amongst those men
who were suffering for the Duke and for the religious cause he had
professed to champion. Many refused utterly to believe it. A wild story
began to circulate that a man resembling Monmouth had offered himself up
in the Dukeâ€™s stead, and that Monmouth survived to come again in glory
to deliver Zion and make war upon Babylon.
Mr. Blood heard that tale with the same indifference with which he had
received the news of Monmouthâ€™s death. But one shameful thing he heard
in connection with this which left him not quite so unmoved, and served
to nourish the contempt he was forming for King James. His Majesty had
consented to see Monmouth. To have done so unless he intended to pardon
him was a thing execrable and damnable beyond belief; for the only other
object in granting that interview could be the evilly mean satisfaction
of spurning the abject penitence of his unfortunate nephew.
Later they heard that Lord Grey, who after the Duke--indeed, perhaps,
before him--was the main leader of the rebellion, had purchased his own
pardon for forty thousand pounds. Peter Blood found this of a piece with
the rest. His contempt for King James blazed out at last.
â€œWhy, hereâ€™s a filthy mean creature to sit on a throne. If I had known
as much of him before as I know to-day, I donâ€™t doubt I should have
NA
NA
Young Pitt, whom he addressed, turned towards him a face from which the
ruddy tan of the sea had faded almost completely during those months of
captivity. His grey eyes were round and questioning. Blood answered him.
â€œSure, now, weâ€™ve never seen his lordship since that day at
Oglethorpeâ€™s. And where are the other gentry that were taken?--the real
leaders of this plaguey rebellion. Greyâ€™s case explains their absence,
I think. They are wealthy men that can ransom themselves. Here awaiting
the gallows are none but the unfortunates who followed; those who had
the honour to lead them go free. Itâ€™s a curious and instructive reversal
of the usual way of these things. Faith, itâ€™s an uncertain world
NA
He laughed, and settled down into that spirit of scorn, wrapped in
which he stepped later into the great hall of Taunton Castle to take his
trial. With him went Pitt and the yeoman Baynes. The three of them were
to be tried together, and their case was to open the proceedings of that
ghastly day.
The hall, even to the galleries--thronged with spectators, most of whom
were ladies--was hung in scarlet; a pleasant conceit, this, of the Lord
Chief Justiceâ€™s, who naturally enough preferred the colour that should
reflect his own bloody mind.
At the upper end, on a raised dais, sat the Lords Commissioners, the
five judges in their scarlet robes and heavy dark periwigs, Baron
Jeffreys of Wem enthroned in the middle place.
The prisoners filed in under guard. The crier called for silence under
pain of imprisonment, and as the hum of voices gradually became hushed,
Mr. Blood considered with interest the twelve good men and true that
composed the jury. Neither good nor true did they look. They were
scared, uneasy, and hangdog as any set of thieves caught with their
hands in the pockets of their neighbours. They were twelve shaken men,
each of whom stood between the sword of the Lord Chief Justiceâ€™s recent
bloodthirsty charge and the wall of his own conscience.
From them Mr. Bloodâ€™s calm, deliberate glance passed on to consider the
Lords Commissioners, and particularly the presiding Judge, that Lord
Jeffreys, whose terrible fame had come ahead of him from Dorchester.
He beheld a tall, slight man on the young side of forty, with an oval
face that was delicately beautiful. There were dark stains of suffering
or sleeplessness under the low-lidded eyes, heightening their brilliance
and their gentle melancholy. The face was very pale, save for the vivid
colour of the full lips and the hectic flush on the rather high but
inconspicuous cheek-bones. It was something in those lips that marred
the perfection of that countenance; a fault, elusive but undeniable,
lurked there to belie the fine sensitiveness of those nostrils, the
tenderness of those dark, liquid eyes and the noble calm of that pale
brow.
The physician in Mr. Blood regarded the man with peculiar interest
knowing as he did the agonizing malady from which his lordship suffered,
and the amazingly irregular, debauched life that he led in spite of
it--perhaps because of it.
NA
Abruptly he was recalled to his position by the harsh voice of the clerk
of arraigns. His obedience was mechanical, and the clerk droned out the
wordy indictment which pronounced Peter Blood a false traitor against
the Most Illustrious and Most Excellent Prince, James the Second, by
the grace of God, of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland King, his
supreme and natural lord. It informed him that, having no fear of God in
his heart, but being moved and seduced by the instigation of the Devil,
he had failed in the love and true and due natural obedience towards his
said lord the King, and had moved to disturb the peace and tranquillity
of the kingdom and to stir up war and rebellion to depose his said lord
the King from the title, honour, and the regal name of the imperial
crown--and much more of the same kind, at the end of all of which he
was invited to say whether he was guilty or not guilty. He answered more
than was asked.
NA
A small, sharp-faced man at a table before and to the right of him
bounced up. It was Mr. Pollexfen, the Judge-Advocate.

addressing himself to the bench. â€œOn this same subject of words, may it
please your lordships, I am guilty of nothing to justify any of those
words I have heard used to describe me, unless it be of a want of
patience at having been closely confined for two months and longer in a
NA
Being started, he would have added a deal more; but at this point the
Lord Chief Justice interposed in a gentle, rather plaintive voice.
â€œLook you, sir: because we must observe the common and usual methods of
trial, I must interrupt you now. You are no doubt ignorant of the forms
NA
â€œNot only ignorant, my lord, but hitherto most happy in that ignorance.
NA
A pale smile momentarily lightened the wistful countenance.
â€œI believe you. You shall be fully heard when you come to your defence.
NA
Enheartened by that apparent sympathy and consideration, Mr. Blood
answered thereafter, as was required of him, that he would be tried by
God and his country. Whereupon, having prayed to God to send him a good
deliverance, the clerk called upon Andrew Baynes to hold up his hand and
plead.
From Baynes, who pleaded not guilty, the clerk passed on to Pitt, who
boldly owned his guilt. The Lord Chief Justice stirred at that.
NA
â€œIf all were as obstinate as his two fellow-rebels, there would never be
NA
After that ominous interpolation, delivered with an inhuman iciness that
sent a shiver through the court, Mr. Pollexfen got to his feet. With
great prolixity he stated the general case against the three men, and
the particular case against Peter Blood, whose indictment was to be
taken first.
The only witness called for the King was Captain Hobart. He testified
briskly to the manner in which he had found and taken the three
prisoners, together with Lord Gildoy. Upon the orders of his colonel he
would have hanged Pitt out of hand, but was restrained by the lies of
the prisoner Blood, who led him to believe that Pitt was a peer of the
realm and a person of consideration.
As the Captainâ€™s evidence concluded, Lord Jeffreys looked across at
Peter Blood.
NA
NA
â€œI am glad to have your admission of that without any of the
prevarications that are usual in your kind. And I will say this, that
here prevarication would avail you little. For we always have the truth
NA
Baynes and Pitt similarly admitted the accuracy of the Captainâ€™s
evidence, whereupon the scarlet figure of the Lord Chief Justice heaved
a sigh of relief.
NA
 There was now no trace of gentleness in his voice. It was brisk and
rasping, and the lips through which it passed were curved in scorn. â€œI
take it, Mr. Pollexfen, that the wicked treason of these three rogues
being established--indeed, admitted by them--there is no more to be
NA
Peter Bloodâ€™s voice rang out crisply, on a note that almost seemed to
contain laughter.
NA
His lordship looked at him, first in blank amazement at his audacity,
then gradually with an expression of dull anger. The scarlet lips fell
into unpleasant, cruel lines that transfigured the whole countenance.
NA
â€œI would have your lordship and the gentlemen of the jury hear me on my
NA
NA
harsh as a file. He writhed as he spoke, and for an instant his features
were distorted. A delicate dead-white hand, on which the veins showed
blue, brought forth a handkerchief with which he dabbed his lips and
then his brow. Observing him with his physicianâ€™s eye, Peter Blood
judged him a prey to the pain of the disease that was destroying him.
NA
NA
NA
NA
latter shifted uncomfortably under the confident flash of his blue eyes.
Lord Jeffreysâ€™s bullying charge had whipped the spirit out of them. Had
they, themselves, been prisoners accused of treason, he could not have
arraigned them more ferociously.
Peter Blood stood boldly forward, erect, self-possessed, and saturnine.
He was freshly shaven, and his periwig, if out of curl, was at least
carefully combed and dressed.
â€œCaptain Hobart has testified to what he knows--that he found me at
Oglethorpeâ€™s Farm on the Monday morning after the battle at Weston. But
NA
Again the Judge broke in. â€œWhy, what should you have been doing there
in the company of rebels, two of whom--Lord Gildoy and your fellow

NA
â€œI pray you do, and in Godâ€™s name be brief, man. For if I am to be

then an officer in the French service. You heard the prisoner admit that

â€œWhy, so he had. Yet what I am telling you is also true, so it is. For
some years I was a soldier; but before that I was a physician, and I

â€œThereâ€™s not the need to waste our time with that. I will convict you
out of your own rascally mouth. I will ask you only this: How came you,

â€œI was never with that army. No witness has sworn to that, and I dare

There was a ripple of laughter in the galleries, instantly quelled by
the fierce glare of the Judge and the voice of the crier.
Lord Jeffreys leaned farther forward upon his desk. He raised that
delicate white hand, still clutching its handkerchief, and sprouting
from a froth of lace.

immortal soul, and there is nothing in the world equal to it in value.

thou and we and all persons are to stand at the last day, will take
vengeance on thee for every falsehood, and justly strike thee into
eternal flames, make thee drop into the bottomless pit of fire and

Peter Blood gaped at him a moment in consternation. The man was
incredible, unreal, fantastic, a nightmare judge. Then he collected
himself to answer.
â€œI was summoned that morning to succour Lord Gildoy, and I conceived it

twisted lips red as the blood for which they thirsted--glared upon
him in evil mockery. Then he controlled himself as if by an effort.
He sighed. He resumed his earlier gentle plaintiveness. â€œLord! How you

NA
â€œOh! Master Pitt will testify--he that is himself a traitor

â€œGood Master Baynes will have to answer for himself; and I doubt not

â€œI could bring others from Bridgewater, who saw me set out that morning

His lordship smiled. â€œIt will not be necessary. For, mark me, I do not
intend to waste more time on you. Answer me only this: When Master Pitt,
as you pretend, came to summon you, did you know that he had been, as

Peter Blood lost patience for a moment. â€œMy business, my lord, was with

A murmur from the galleries and even from the jury approved him. It
served only to drive his terrible judge into a deeper fury.
â€œJesus God! Was there ever such an impudent villain in the world as

and withal you cannot but observe the spirit of this sort of people,

this, sir: When you cozened Captain Hobart with your lies concerning the

It was a shrewd, sharp thrust aimed at the jury, and it reveals,
I think, the alertness of the manâ€™s mind, his self-possession ever
steadiest in moments of dire peril. With any other jury it must have
made the impression that he hoped to make. It may even have made its
impression upon these poor pusillanimous sheep. But the dread judge was
there to efface it.
He gasped aloud, then flung himself violently forward.
NA
rascal? But I have done with you. I see thee, villain, I see thee
NA
Having spoken so, gloatingly, evilly, he sank back again, and composed
himself. It was as if a curtain fell. All emotion passed again from his
pale face. Back to invest it again came that gentle melancholy. Speaking
after a momentâ€™s pause, his voice was soft, almost tender, yet every
word of it carried sharply through that hushed court.
â€œIf I know my own heart it is not in my nature to desire the hurt of
anybody, much less to delight in his eternal perdition. It is out of
compassion for you that I have used all these words--because I would
have you have some regard for your immortal soul, and not ensure its
damnation by obdurately persisting in falsehood and prevarication. But I
see that all the pains in the world, and all compassion and charity are

to the jury that countenance of wistful beauty. â€œGentlemen, I must tell
you for law, of which we are the judges, and not you, that if any person
be in actual rebellion against the King, and another person--who really
and actually was not in rebellion--does knowingly receive, harbour,
comfort, or succour him, such a person is as much a traitor as he who
indeed bore arms. We are bound by our oaths and consciences to declare
to you what is law; and you are bound by your oaths and your consciences
NA
Upon that he proceeded to his summing-up, showing how Baynes and Blood
were both guilty of treason, the first for having harboured a traitor,
the second for having succoured that traitor by dressing his wounds. He
interlarded his address by sycophantic allusions to his natural lord
and lawful sovereign, the King, whom God had set over them, and with
vituperations of Nonconformity and of Monmouth, of whom--in his own
words--he dared boldly affirm that the meanest subject within the
kingdom that was of legitimate birth had a better title to the crown.
â€œJesus God! That ever we should have such a generation of vipers among
NA
exhausted by the violence he had used. A moment he was still, dabbing
his lips again; then he moved uneasily; once more his features were
twisted by pain, and in a few snarling, almost incoherent words he
dismissed the jury to consider the verdict.
Peter Blood had listened to the intemperate, the blasphemous, and almost
obscene invective of that tirade with a detachment that afterwards, in
retrospect, surprised him. He was so amazed by the man, by the reactions
taking place in him between mind and body, and by his methods of
bullying and coercing the jury into bloodshed, that he almost forgot
that his own life was at stake.
The absence of that dazed jury was a brief one. The verdict found the
three prisoners guilty. Peter Blood looked round the scarlet-hung court.
For an instant that foam of white faces seemed to heave before him. Then
he was himself again, and a voice was asking him what he had to say
for himself, why sentence of death should not be passed upon him, being
convicted of high treason.
He laughed, and his laugh jarred uncannily upon the deathly stillness
of the court. It was all so grotesque, such a mockery of justice
administered by that wistful-eyed jack-pudding in scarlet, who was
himself a mockery--the venal instrument of a brutally spiteful and
vindictive king. His laughter shocked the austerity of that same
jack-pudding.
â€œDo you laugh, sirrah, with the rope about your neck, upon the very

And then Blood took his revenge.
â€œFaith, itâ€™s in better case I am for mirth than your lordship. For I
have this to say before you deliver judgment. Your lordship sees me--an
innocent man whose only offence is that I practised charity--with a
halter round my neck. Your lordship, being the justiciar, speaks with
knowledge of what is to come to me. I, being a physician, may speak with
knowledge of what is to come to your lordship. And I tell you that I
would not now change places with you--that I would not exchange this
halter that you fling about my neck for the stone that you carry in
your body. The death to which you may doom me is a light pleasantry by
contrast with the death to which your lordship has been doomed by that
NA
The Lord Chief Justice sat stiffly upright, his face ashen, his lips
twitching, and whilst you might have counted ten there was no sound in
that paralyzed court after Peter Blood had finished speaking. All those
who knew Lord Jeffreys regarded this as the lull before the storm, and
braced themselves for the explosion. But none came.
Slowly, faintly, the colour crept back into that ashen face. The scarlet
figure lost its rigidity, and bent forward. His lordship began to speak.
In a muted voice and briefly--much more briefly than his wont on such
occasions and in a manner entirely mechanical, the manner of a man
whose thoughts are elsewhere while his lips are speaking--he delivered
sentence of death in the prescribed form, and without the least
allusion to what Peter Blood had said. Having delivered it, he sank back
exhausted, his eyes half-closed, his brow agleam with sweat.
The prisoners filed out.
Mr. Pollexfen--a Whig at heart despite the position of Judge-Advocate
which he occupied--was overheard by one of the jurors to mutter in the
ear of a brother counsel:
â€œOn my soul, that swarthy rascal has given his lordship a scare. Itâ€™s a
NA
CHAPTER IV. HUMAN MERCHANDISE
Mr. Pollexfen was at one and the same time right and wrong--a condition
much more common than is generally supposed.
He was right in his indifferently expressed thought that a man whose
mien and words could daunt such a lord of terror as Jeffreys, should by
the dominance of his nature be able to fashion himself a considerable
destiny. He was wrong--though justifiably so--in his assumption that
Peter Blood must hang.
I have said that the tribulations with which he was visited as a result
of his errand of mercy to Oglethorpeâ€™s Farm contained--although as yet
he did not perceive it, perhaps--two sources of thankfulness: one that
he was tried at all; the other that his trial took place on the 19th
of September. Until the 18th, the sentences passed by the court of the
Lords Commissioners had been carried out literally and expeditiously.
But on the morning of the 19th there arrived at Taunton a courier from
Lord Sunderland, the Secretary of State, with a letter for Lord Jeffreys
wherein he was informed that His Majesty had been graciously pleased
to command that eleven hundred rebels should be furnished for
transportation to some of His Majestyâ€™s southern plantations, Jamaica,
Barbados, or any of the Leeward Islands.
You are not to suppose that this command was dictated by any sense of
mercy. Lord Churchill was no more than just when he spoke of the Kingâ€™s
heart as being as insensible as marble. It had been realized that in
these wholesale hangings there was taking place a reckless waste of
valuable material. Slaves were urgently required in the plantations,
and a healthy, vigorous man could be reckoned worth at least from ten
to fifteen pounds. Then, there were at court many gentlemen who had some
claim or other upon His Majestyâ€™s bounty. Here was a cheap and ready way
to discharge these claims. From amongst the convicted rebels a certain
number might be set aside to be bestowed upon those gentlemen, so that
they might dispose of them to their own profit.
My Lord Sunderlandâ€™s letter gives precise details of the royal
munificence in human flesh. A thousand prisoners were to be distributed
among some eight courtiers and others, whilst a postscriptum to his
lordshipâ€™s letter asked for a further hundred to be held at the disposal
of the Queen. These prisoners were to be transported at once to His
Majestyâ€™s southern plantations, and to be kept there for the space of
ten years before being restored to liberty, the parties to whom they
were assigned entering into security to see that transportation was
immediately effected.
We know from Lord Jeffreysâ€™s secretary how the Chief Justice inveighed
that night in drunken frenzy against this misplaced clemency to which
His Majesty had been persuaded. We know how he attempted by letter to
induce the King to reconsider his decision. But James adhered to it. It
was--apart from the indirect profit he derived from it--a clemency
full worthy of him. He knew that to spare lives in this fashion was to
convert them into living deaths. Many must succumb in torment to the
horrors of West Indian slavery, and so be the envy of their surviving
companions.
Thus it happened that Peter Blood, and with him Jeremy Pitt and Andrew
Baynes, instead of being hanged, drawn, and quartered as their sentences
directed, were conveyed to Bristol and there shipped with some fifty
others aboard the Jamaica Merchant. From close confinement under
hatches, ill-nourishment and foul water, a sickness broke out amongst
them, of which eleven died. Amongst these was the unfortunate yeoman
from Oglethorpeâ€™s Farm, brutally torn from his quiet homestead amid
the fragrant cider orchards for no other sin but that he had practised
mercy.
The mortality might have been higher than it was but for Peter Blood.
At first the master of the Jamaica Merchant had answered with oaths and
threats the doctorâ€™s expostulations against permitting men to perish
in this fashion, and his insistence that he should be made free of the
medicine chest and given leave to minister to the sick. But presently
Captain Gardner came to see that he might be brought to task for
these too heavy losses of human merchandise and because of this he was
belatedly glad to avail himself of the skill of Peter Blood. The doctor
went to work zealously and zestfully, and wrought so ably that, by his
ministrations and by improving the condition of his fellow-captives, he
checked the spread of the disease.
Towards the middle of December the Jamaica Merchant dropped anchor in
Carlisle Bay, and put ashore the forty-two surviving rebels-convict.
If these unfortunates had imagined--as many of them appear to have
done--that they were coming into some wild, savage country, the
prospect, of which they had a glimpse before they were hustled over
the shipâ€™s side into the waiting boats, was enough to correct the
impression. They beheld a town of sufficiently imposing proportions
composed of houses built upon European notions of architecture, but
without any of the huddle usual in European cities. The spire of a
church rose dominantly above the red roofs, a fort guarded the entrance
of the wide harbour, with guns thrusting their muzzles between the
crenels, and the wide facade of Government House revealed itself
dominantly placed on a gentle hill above the town. This hill was vividly
green as is an English hill in April, and the day was such a day as
April gives to England, the season of heavy rains being newly ended.
On a wide cobbled space on the sea front they found a guard of
red-coated militia drawn up to receive them, and a crowd--attracted by
their arrival--which in dress and manner differed little from a crowd in
a seaport at home save that it contained fewer women and a great number
of negroes.
To inspect them, drawn up there on the mole, came Governor Steed,
a short, stout, red-faced gentleman, in blue taffetas burdened by a
prodigious amount of gold lace, who limped a little and leaned heavily
upon a stout ebony cane. After him, in the uniform of a colonel of the
Barbados Militia, rolled a tall, corpulent man who towered head and
shoulders above the Governor, with malevolence plainly written on his
enormous yellowish countenance. At his side, and contrasting oddly with
his grossness, moving with an easy stripling grace, came a slight young
lady in a modish riding-gown. The broad brim of a grey hat with scarlet
sweep of ostrich plume shaded an oval face upon which the climate of
the Tropic of Cancer had made no impression, so delicately fair was its
complexion. Ringlets of red-brown hair hung to her shoulders. Frankness
looked out from her hazel eyes which were set wide; commiseration
repressed now the mischievousness that normally inhabited her fresh
young mouth.
Peter Blood caught himself staring in a sort of amazement at that
piquant face, which seemed here so out of place, and finding his stare
returned, he shifted uncomfortably. He grew conscious of the sorry
figure that he cut. Unwashed, with rank and matted hair and a
disfiguring black beard upon his face, and the erstwhile splendid suit
of black camlet in which he had been taken prisoner now reduced to rags
that would have disgraced a scarecrow, he was in no case for inspection
by such dainty eyes as these. Nevertheless, they continued to inspect
him with round-eyed, almost childlike wonder and pity. Their owner put
forth a hand to touch the scarlet sleeve of her companion, whereupon
with an ill-tempered grunt the man swung his great bulk round so that he
directly confronted her.
Looking up into his face, she was speaking to him earnestly, but the
Colonel plainly gave her no more than the half of his attention. His
little beady eyes, closely flanking a fleshly, pendulous nose, had
passed from her and were fixed upon fair-haired, sturdy young Pitt, who
was standing beside Blood.
The Governor had also come to a halt, and for a moment now that little
group of three stood in conversation. What the lady said, Peter could
not hear at all, for she lowered her voice; the Colonelâ€™s reached him
in a confused rumble, but the Governor was neither considerate nor
indistinct; he had a high-pitched voice which carried far, and believing
himself witty, he desired to be heard by all.
â€œBut, my dear Colonel Bishop, it is for you to take first choice from
this dainty nosegay, and at your own price. After that weâ€™ll send the

Colonel Bishop nodded his acknowledgment. He raised his voice in
answering. â€œYour excellency is very good. But, faith, theyâ€™re a weedy
NA
scanned them again, and his contempt of them deepened the malevolence of
his face. It was as if he were annoyed with them for being in no better
condition. Then he beckoned forward Captain Gardner, the master of the
Jamaica Merchant, and for some minutes stood in talk with him over a
list which the latter produced at his request.
Presently he waved aside the list and advanced alone towards the
rebels-convict, his eyes considering them, his lips pursed. Before the
young Somersetshire shipmaster he came to a halt, and stood an instant
pondering him. Then he fingered the muscles of the young manâ€™s arm,
and bade him open his mouth that he might see his teeth. He pursed his
coarse lips again and nodded.
He spoke to Gardner over his shoulder.

The Captain made a face of dismay. â€œFifteen pounds! It isnâ€™t half what I

NA

â€œI can get a negro for that. These white swine donâ€™t live. Theyâ€™re not
NA
Gardner broke into protestations of Pittâ€™s health, youth, and vigour.
It was not a man he was discussing; it was a beast of burden. Pitt, a
sensitive lad, stood mute and unmoving. Only the ebb and flow of colour
in his cheeks showed the inward struggle by which he maintained his
self-control.
Peter Blood was nauseated by the loathsome haggle.
In the background, moving slowly away down the line of prisoners, went
the lady in conversation with the Governor, who smirked and preened
himself as he limped beside her. She was unconscious of the loathly
business the Colonel was transacting. Was she, wondered Blood,
indifferent to it?
Colonel Bishop swung on his heel to pass on.
â€œIâ€™ll go as far as twenty pounds. Not a penny more, and itâ€™s twice as
NA
Captain Gardner, recognizing the finality of the tone, sighed and
yielded. Already Bishop was moving down the line. For Mr. Blood, as
for a weedy youth on his left, the Colonel had no more than a glance of
contempt. But the next man, a middle-aged Colossus named Wolverstone,
who had lost an eye at Sedgemoor, drew his regard, and the haggling was
recommenced.
Peter Blood stood there in the brilliant sunshine and inhaled the
fragrant air, which was unlike any air that he had ever breathed. It
was laden with a strange perfume, blend of logwood flower, pimento, and
aromatic cedars. He lost himself in unprofitable speculations born of
that singular fragrance. He was in no mood for conversation, nor was
Pitt, who stood dumbly at his side, and who was afflicted mainly at the
moment by the thought that he was at last about to be separated from
this man with whom he had stood shoulder to shoulder throughout all
these troublous months, and whom he had come to love and depend upon for
guidance and sustenance. A sense of loneliness and misery pervaded him
by contrast with which all that he had endured seemed as nothing. To
Pitt, this separation was the poignant climax of all his sufferings.
Other buyers came and stared at them, and passed on. Blood did not heed
them. And then at the end of the line there was a movement. Gardner was
speaking in a loud voice, making an announcement to the general public
of buyers that had waited until Colonel Bishop had taken his choice of
that human merchandise. As he finished, Blood, looking in his direction,
noticed that the girl was speaking to Bishop, and pointing up the line
with a silver-hilted riding-whip she carried. Bishop shaded his eyes
with his hand to look in the direction in which she was pointing.
Then slowly, with his ponderous, rolling gait, he approached again
accompanied by Gardner, and followed by the lady and the Governor.
On they came until the Colonel was abreast of Blood. He would have
passed on, but that the lady tapped his arm with her whip.

NA
staring into a pair of beady brown eyes sunk into a yellow, fleshly face
like currants into a dumpling. He felt the colour creeping into his face
under the insult of that contemptuous inspection. â€œBah! A bag of bones.

He was turning away when Gardner interposed.
â€œHe maybe lean, but heâ€™s tough; tough and healthy. When half of them was
sick and the other half sickening, this rogue kept his legs and doctored
his fellows. But for him thereâ€™d haâ€™ been more deaths than there was.
Say fifteen pounds for him, Colonel. Thatâ€™s cheap enough. Heâ€™s tough, I
tell your honour--tough and strong, though he be lean. And heâ€™s just the

There came a chuckle from Governor Steed. â€œYou hear, Colonel. Trust

pleased with his wit.
But he laughed alone. A cloud of annoyance swept across the face of
the Colonelâ€™s niece, whilst the Colonel himself was too absorbed in the
consideration of this bargain to heed the Governorâ€™s humour. He twisted
his lip a little, stroking his chin with his hand the while. Jeremy Pitt
had almost ceased to breathe.
NA
Peter Blood prayed that the offer might be rejected. For no reason that
he could have given you, he was taken with repugnance at the thought
of becoming the property of this gross animal, and in some sort the
property of that hazel-eyed young girl. But it would need more than
repugnance to save him from his destiny. A slave is a slave, and has
no power to shape his fate. Peter Blood was sold to Colonel Bishop--a
disdainful buyer--for the ignominious sum of ten pounds.
CHAPTER V. ARABELLA BISHOP
One sunny morning in January, about a month after the arrival of the
Jamaica Merchant at Bridgetown, Miss Arabella Bishop rode out from her
uncleâ€™s fine house on the heights to the northwest of the city. She was
attended by two negroes who trotted after her at a respectful distance,
and her destination was Government House, whither she went to visit the
Governorâ€™s lady, who had lately been ailing. Reaching the summit of
a gentle, grassy slope, she met a tall, lean man dressed in a sober,
gentlemanly fashion, who was walking in the opposite direction. He was
a stranger to her, and strangers were rare enough in the island. And yet
in some vague way he did not seem quite a stranger.
Miss Arabella drew rein, affecting to pause that she might admire the
prospect, which was fair enough to warrant it. Yet out of the corner
of those hazel eyes she scanned this fellow very attentively as he came
nearer. She corrected her first impression of his dress. It was
sober enough, but hardly gentlemanly. Coat and breeches were of plain
homespun; and if the former sat so well upon him it was more by virtue
of his natural grace than by that of tailoring. His stockings were of
cotton, harsh and plain, and the broad castor, which he respectfully
doffed as he came up with her, was an old one unadorned by band or
feather. What had seemed to be a periwig at a little distance was now
revealed for the manâ€™s own lustrous coiling black hair.
Out of a brown, shaven, saturnine face two eyes that were startlingly
blue considered her gravely. The man would have passed on but that she
detained him.
NA
Her voice was crisp and boyish, and there was something of boyishness
in her manner--if one can apply the term to so dainty a lady. It arose
perhaps from an ease, a directness, which disdained the artifices of her
sex, and set her on good terms with all the world. To this it may be
due that Miss Arabella had reached the age of five and twenty not merely
unmarried but unwooed. She used with all men a sisterly frankness which
in itself contains a quality of aloofness, rendering it difficult for
any man to become her lover.
Her negroes had halted at some distance in the rear, and they squatted
now upon the short grass until it should be her pleasure to proceed upon
her way.
The stranger came to a standstill upon being addressed.
NA
NA
â€œYour uncleâ€™s, leastways. Let me present myself. I am called Peter
Blood, and I am worth precisely ten pounds. I know it because that
is the sum your uncle paid for me. It is not every man has the same
NA
She recognized him then. She had not seen him since that day upon the
mole a month ago, and that she should not instantly have known him
again despite the interest he had then aroused in her is not surprising,
considering the change he had wrought in his appearance, which now was
hardly that of a slave.
NA
NA
NA
NA
What she had heard was that this rebel-convict had been discovered to
be a physician. The thing had come to the ears of Governor Steed, who
suffered damnably from the gout, and Governor Steed had borrowed the
fellow from his purchaser. Whether by skill or good fortune, Peter Blood
had afforded the Governor that relief which his excellency had failed to
obtain from the ministrations of either of the two physicians practising
in Bridgetown. Then the Governorâ€™s lady had desired him to attend her
for the megrims. Mr. Blood had found her suffering from nothing worse
than peevishness--the result of a natural petulance aggravated by the
dulness of life in Barbados to a lady of her social aspirations. But he
had prescribed for her none the less, and she had conceived herself the
better for his prescription. After that the fame of him had gone through
Bridgetown, and Colonel Bishop had found that there was more profit to
be made out of this new slave by leaving him to pursue his profession
than by setting him to work on the plantations, for which purpose he had
been originally acquired.
â€œIt is yourself, madam, I have to thank for my comparatively easy
NA
NA
The gratitude was in his words rather than in his tone. Was he mocking,
she wondered, and looked at him with the searching frankness that
another might have found disconcerting. He took the glance for a
question, and answered it.
NA
the facts of my shining abilities might never have been brought to
light, and I should be hewing and hoeing at this moment like the poor

â€œBut he would not have done so had you not urged him. I perceived your

NA
 There was a slight severity in her tone, as if to reprove the mixture of
mockery and flippancy in which he seemed to be speaking.
She proceeded to explain herself. â€œMy uncle may appear to you a hard
man. No doubt he is. They are all hard men, these planters. It is the
life, I suppose. But there are others here who are worse. There is Mr.
Crabston, for instance, up at Speightstown. He was there on the mole,
waiting to buy my uncleâ€™s leavings, and if you had fallen into his

He was a little bewildered.

â€œOn the contrary. The others are all worthy rebels. I am not. That
is the difference. I was one who had not the wit to see that England
requires purifying. I was content to pursue a doctorâ€™s trade in
Bridgewater whilst my betters were shedding their blood to drive out an

 said he.
She made a little impatient movement with her hand, and looked away from
him a moment, out to sea. Quite suddenly she looked at him again; and
now her brows were knit.

He saw the thing she apprehended, and he laughed. â€œFaith, now, itâ€™s a

He looked first to right, then to left as he spoke, from the distant
shadowy bulk of Mount Hillbay to the limitless ocean ruffled by the
winds of heaven. Then, as if the fair prospect rendered him conscious
of his own littleness and the insignificance of his woes, he fell
thoughtful.

her horse with her little silver-hilted whip. â€œI congratulate you on
NA
He bowed, and she moved on. Her negroes sprang up, and went trotting
after her.
Awhile Peter Blood remained standing there, where she left him, conning
the sunlit waters of Carlisle Bay below, and the shipping in that
spacious haven about which the gulls were fluttering noisily.
It was a fair enough prospect, he reflected, but it was a prison, and in
announcing that he preferred it to England, he had indulged that almost
laudable form of boasting which lies in belittling our misadventures.
He turned, and resuming his way, went off in long, swinging strides
towards the little huddle of huts built of mud and wattles--a miniature
village enclosed in a stockade which the plantation slaves inhabited,
and where he, himself, was lodged with them.
Through his mind sang the line of Lovelace:
  â€œStone walls do not a prison make,
NA
But he gave it a fresh meaning, the very converse of that which its
author had intended. A prison, he reflected, was a prison, though it had
neither walls nor bars, however spacious it might be. And as he realized
it that morning so he was to realize it increasingly as time sped on.
Daily he came to think more of his clipped wings, of his exclusion from
the world, and less of the fortuitous liberty he enjoyed. Nor did the
contrasting of his comparatively easy lot with that of his unfortunate
fellow-convicts bring him the satisfaction a differently constituted
mind might have derived from it. Rather did the contemplation of their
misery increase the bitterness that was gathering in his soul.
Of the forty-two who had been landed with him from the Jamaica Merchant,
Colonel Bishop had purchased no less than twenty-five. The remainder had
gone to lesser planters, some of them to Speightstown, and others still
farther north. What may have been the lot of the latter he could not
tell, but amongst Bishopâ€™s slaves Peter Blood came and went freely,
sleeping in their quarters, and their lot he knew to be a brutalizing
misery. They toiled in the sugar plantations from sunrise to sunset, and
if their labours flagged, there were the whips of the overseer and his
men to quicken them. They went in rags, some almost naked; they dwelt
in squalor, and they were ill-nourished on salted meat and maize
dumplings--food which to many of them was for a season at least so
nauseating that two of them sickened and died before Bishop remembered
that their lives had a certain value in labour to him and yielded to
Bloodâ€™s intercessions for a better care of such as fell ill. To curb
insubordination, one of them who had rebelled against Kent, the brutal
overseer, was lashed to death by negroes under his comradesâ€™ eyes, and
another who had been so misguided as to run away into the woods was
tracked, brought back, flogged, and then branded on the forehead with
NA
as long as he lived. Fortunately for him the poor fellow died as a
consequence of the flogging.
After that a dull, spiritless resignation settled down upon the
remainder. The most mutinous were quelled, and accepted their
unspeakable lot with the tragic fortitude of despair.
Peter Blood alone, escaping these excessive sufferings, remained
outwardly unchanged, whilst inwardly the only change in him was a daily
deeper hatred of his kind, a daily deeper longing to escape from this
place where man defiled so foully the lovely work of his Creator. It was
a longing too vague to amount to a hope. Hope here was inadmissible.
And yet he did not yield to despair. He set a mask of laughter on his
saturnine countenance and went his way, treating the sick to the
profit of Colonel Bishop, and encroaching further and further upon the
preserves of the two other men of medicine in Bridgetown.
Immune from the degrading punishments and privations of his
fellow-convicts, he was enabled to keep his self-respect, and was
treated without harshness even by the soulless planter to whom he had
been sold. He owed it all to gout and megrims. He had won the esteem of
Governor Steed, and--what is even more important--of Governor Steedâ€™s
lady, whom he shamelessly and cynically flattered and humoured.
Occasionally he saw Miss Bishop, and they seldom met but that she paused
to hold him in conversation for some moments, evincing her interest
in him. Himself, he was never disposed to linger. He was not, he told
himself, to be deceived by her delicate exterior, her sapling grace, her
easy, boyish ways and pleasant, boyish voice. In all his life--and it
had been very varied--he had never met a man whom he accounted more
beastly than her uncle, and he could not dissociate her from the man.
She was his niece, of his own blood, and some of the vices of it, some
of the remorseless cruelty of the wealthy planter must, he argued,
inhabit that pleasant body of hers. He argued this very often to
himself, as if answering and convincing some instinct that pleaded
otherwise, and arguing it he avoided her when it was possible, and was
frigidly civil when it was not.
Justifiable as his reasoning was, plausible as it may seem, yet he would
have done better to have trusted the instinct that was in conflict
with it. Though the same blood ran in her veins as in those of Colonel
Bishop, yet hers was free of the vices that tainted her uncleâ€™s, for
these vices were not natural to that blood; they were, in his
case, acquired. Her father, Tom Bishop--that same Colonel Bishopâ€™s
brother--had been a kindly, chivalrous, gentle soul, who, broken-hearted
by the early death of a young wife, had abandoned the Old World and
sought an anodyne for his grief in the New. He had come out to the
Antilles, bringing with him his little daughter, then five years of age,
and had given himself up to the life of a planter. He had prospered
from the first, as men sometimes will who care nothing for prosperity.
Prospering, he had bethought him of his younger brother, a soldier at
home reputed somewhat wild. He had advised him to come out to Barbados;
and the advice, which at another season William Bishop might have
scorned, reached him at a moment when his wildness was beginning to bear
such fruit that a change of climate was desirable. William came, and
was admitted by his generous brother to a partnership in the prosperous
plantation. Some six years later, when Arabella was fifteen, her father
died, leaving her in her uncleâ€™s guardianship. It was perhaps his one
mistake. But the goodness of his own nature coloured his views of other
men; moreover, himself, he had conducted the education of his daughter,
giving her an independence of character upon which perhaps he counted
unduly. As things were, there was little love between uncle and niece.
But she was dutiful to him, and he was circumspect in his behaviour
before her. All his life, and for all his wildness, he had gone in a
certain awe of his brother, whose worth he had the wit to recognize;
and now it was almost as if some of that awe was transferred to his
brotherâ€™s child, who was also, in a sense, his partner, although she
took no active part in the business of the plantations.
Peter Blood judged her--as we are all too prone to judge--upon
insufficient knowledge.
He was very soon to have cause to correct that judgment. One day towards
the end of May, when the heat was beginning to grow oppressive, there
crawled into Carlisle Bay a wounded, battered English ship, the Pride of
Devon, her freeboard scarred and broken, her coach a gaping wreck, her
mizzen so shot away that only a jagged stump remained to tell the place
where it had stood. She had been in action off Martinique with two
Spanish treasure ships, and although her captain swore that the
Spaniards had beset him without provocation, it is difficult to avoid a
suspicion that the encounter had been brought about quite otherwise. One
of the Spaniards had fled from the combat, and if the Pride of Devon had
not given chase it was probably because she was by then in no case to
do so. The other had been sunk, but not before the English ship had
transferred to her own hold a good deal of the treasure aboard the
Spaniard. It was, in fact, one of those piratical affrays which were a
perpetual source of trouble between the courts of St. Jamesâ€™s and the
Escurial, complaints emanating now from one and now from the other side.
Steed, however, after the fashion of most Colonial governors, was
willing enough to dull his wits to the extent of accepting the English
seamanâ€™s story, disregarding any evidence that might belie it. He shared
the hatred so richly deserved by arrogant, overbearing Spain that
was common to men of every other nation from the Bahamas to the Main.
Therefore he gave the Pride of Devon the shelter she sought in his
harbour and every facility to careen and carry out repairs.
But before it came to this, they fetched from her hold over a score of
English seamen as battered and broken as the ship herself, and together
with these some half-dozen Spaniards in like case, the only survivors of
a boarding party from the Spanish galleon that had invaded the English
ship and found itself unable to retreat. These wounded men were conveyed
to a long shed on the wharf, and the medical skill of Bridgetown was
summoned to their aid. Peter Blood was ordered to bear a hand in this
work, and partly because he spoke Castilian--and he spoke it as fluently
as his own native tongue--partly because of his inferior condition as a
slave, he was given the Spaniards for his patients.
Now Blood had no cause to love Spaniards. His two years in a Spanish
prison and his subsequent campaigning in the Spanish Netherlands had
shown him a side of the Spanish character which he had found anything
but admirable. Nevertheless he performed his doctorâ€™s duties zealously
and painstakingly, if emotionlessly, and even with a certain superficial
friendliness towards each of his patients. These were so surprised at
having their wounds healed instead of being summarily hanged that they
manifested a docility very unusual in their kind. They were shunned,
however, by all those charitably disposed inhabitants of Bridgetown who
flocked to the improvised hospital with gifts of fruit and flowers and
delicacies for the injured English seamen. Indeed, had the wishes of
some of these inhabitants been regarded, the Spaniards would have been
left to die like vermin, and of this Peter Blood had an example almost
at the very outset.
With the assistance of one of the negroes sent to the shed for the
purpose, he was in the act of setting a broken leg, when a deep, gruff
voice, that he had come to know and dislike as he had never disliked the
voice of living man, abruptly challenged him.

Blood did not look up from his task. There was not the need. He knew the

the window. The half-naked man on the straw rolled his black eyes to
stare up fearfully out of a clay-coloured face at this intruder. A
knowledge of English was unnecessary to inform him that here came an
enemy. The harsh, minatory note of that voice sufficiently expressed the
fact. â€œI can see that, fool; just as I can see what the rascal is. Who

said shortly, and resumed his work.
â€œIn pain, is he? I hope he is, the damned piratical dog. But will you
NA
The Colonel delivered himself in a roar, infuriated by what he conceived
to be defiance, and defiance expressing itself in the most unruffled
disregard of himself. His long bamboo cane was raised to strike. Peter
Bloodâ€™s blue eyes caught the flash of it, and he spoke quickly to arrest
the blow.
â€œNot insubordinate, sir, whatever I may be. I am acting upon the express

The Colonel checked, his great face empurpling. His mouth fell open.
NA
without another word to Blood rolled away towards the other end of the
shed where the Governor was standing at the moment.
Peter Blood chuckled. But his triumph was dictated less by humanitarian
considerations than by the reflection that he had baulked his brutal
owner.
The Spaniard, realizing that in this altercation, whatever its nature,
the doctor had stood his friend, ventured in a muted voice to ask him
what had happened. But the doctor shook his head in silence, and pursued
his work. His ears were straining to catch the words now passing between
Steed and Bishop. The Colonel was blustering and storming, the great
bulk of him towering above the wizened little overdressed figure of the
Governor. But the little fop was not to be browbeaten. His excellency
was conscious that he had behind him the force of public opinion to
support him. Some there might be, but they were not many, who held such
ruthless views as Colonel Bishop. His excellency asserted his authority.
It was by his orders that Blood had devoted himself to the wounded
Spaniards, and his orders were to be carried out. There was no more to
be said.
Colonel Bishop was of another opinion. In his view there was a
great deal to be said. He said it, with great circumstance, loudly,
vehemently, obscenely--for he could be fluently obscene when moved to
anger.
NA
the Colonelâ€™s pride a wound that was to smart resentfully for many a
week. At the moment it struck him silent, and sent him stamping out of
the shed in a rage for which he could find no words.
It was two days later when the ladies of Bridgetown, the wives and
daughters of her planters and merchants, paid their first visit of
charity to the wharf, bringing their gifts to the wounded seamen.
Again Peter Blood was there, ministering to the sufferers in his care,
moving among those unfortunate Spaniards whom no one heeded. All the
charity, all the gifts were for the members of the crew of the Pride
of Devon. And this Peter Blood accounted natural enough. But rising
suddenly from the re-dressing of a wound, a task in which he had
been absorbed for some moments, he saw to his surprise that one lady,
detached from the general throng, was placing some plantains and a
bundle of succulent sugar cane on the cloak that served one of his
patients for a coverlet. She was elegantly dressed in lavender silk and
was followed by a half-naked negro carrying a basket.
Peter Blood, stripped of his coat, the sleeves of his coarse shirt
rolled to the elbow, and holding a bloody rag in his hand, stood at gaze
a moment. The lady, turning now to confront him, her lips parting in a
smile of recognition, was Arabella Bishop.

misapprehension, and also tinged never so faintly by something of the
derision that was in his soul.
The smile with which she had been greeting him withered on her lips. She

That answer, and its implied rebuke, took him by surprise.

She caught the irony now more plainly in his voice. She continued to
stare at him.

He saw her now, it seemed to him, for the first time, and saw how he had
misjudged her.
â€œSure, now, how was I to guess that... that Colonel Bishop could have

NA
 Having withered him with that and her glance, she turned to her negro
and the basket that he carried. From this she lifted now the fruits and
delicacies with which it was laden, and piled them in such heaps upon
the beds of the six Spaniards that by the time she had so served the
last of them her basket was empty, and there was nothing left for her
own fellow-countrymen. These, indeed, stood in no need of her bounty--as
she no doubt observed--since they were being plentifully supplied by
others.
Having thus emptied her basket, she called her negro, and without
another word or so much as another glance at Peter Blood, swept out of
the place with her head high and chin thrust forward.
Peter watched her departure. Then he fetched a sigh.
It startled him to discover that the thought that he had incurred her
anger gave him concern. It could not have been so yesterday. It became
so only since he had been vouchsafed this revelation of her true nature.
â€œBad cess to it now, it serves me right. It seems I know nothing at all
of human nature. But how the devil was I to guess that a family that can

CHAPTER VI. PLANS OF ESCAPE
After that Arabella Bishop went daily to the shed on the wharf with
gifts of fruit, and later of money and of wearing apparel for the
Spanish prisoners. But she contrived so to time her visits that Peter
Blood never again met her there. Also his own visits were growing
shorter in a measure as his patients healed. That they all throve and
returned to health under his care, whilst fully one third of the wounded
in the care of Whacker and Bronson--the two other surgeons--died
of their wounds, served to increase the reputation in which this
rebel-convict stood in Bridgetown. It may have been no more than the
fortune of war. But the townsfolk did not choose so to regard it. It
led to a further dwindling of the practices of his free colleagues and a
further increase of his own labours and his ownerâ€™s profit. Whacker
and Bronson laid their heads together to devise a scheme by which this
intolerable state of things should be brought to an end. But that is to
anticipate.
One day, whether by accident or design, Peter Blood came striding down
the wharf a full half-hour earlier than usual, and so met Miss Bishop
just issuing from the shed. He doffed his hat and stood aside to give
her passage. She took it, chin in the air, and eyes which disdained to
look anywhere where the sight of him was possible.
NA
She grew conscious of his presence, and looked him over with an air that
was faintly, mockingly searching.
NA
Peter groaned. â€œAm I so hopelessly beyond forgiveness? I ask it very

It was to be a morning of excitements. As he was leaving an hour or so
later, Whacker, the younger of the other two physicians, joined him--an
unprecedented condescension this, for hitherto neither of them had

â€œIf you are for Colonel Bishopâ€™s, Iâ€™ll walk with you a little way,

pendulous cheeks and hard blue eyes.
Peter Blood was startled. But he dissembled it.

sneered. Peter Blood was not quite certain. â€œShe encroaches a deal upon
your time, I hear. Youth and good looks, Doctor Blood! Youth and
good looks! They are inestimable advantages in our profession as in

Peter stared at him. â€œIf you mean what you seem to mean, you had better

 Instinctively his voice grew lower. â€œThis slavery in which you find

NA
Dr. Whacker drew still closer to him as they stepped along the wharf. He
lowered his voice to a still more confidential tone. His hard blue eyes
peered up into the swart, sardonic face of his companion, who was a head
taller than himself.
â€œHow often have I not seen you staring out over the sea, your soul in
your eyes! Donâ€™t I know what you are thinking? If you could escape from
this hell of slavery, you could exercise the profession of which you
are an ornament as a free man with pleasure and profit to yourself. The

more than a stepping-stone to the great world, which would lie open to

Dr. Whacker ceased. He was pale and a little out of breath. But his hard
eyes continued to study his impassive companion.
NA
Yet Blood did not immediately answer. His mind was heaving in tumult,
and he was striving to calm it that he might take a proper survey of
this thing flung into it to create so monstrous a disturbance. He began
where another might have ended.
NA
NA
NA
But he never heeded the answer. Whilst Dr. Whacker was professing that
his heart bled for a brother doctor languishing in slavery, denied the
opportunity which his gifts entitled him to make for himself, Peter
Blood pounced like a hawk upon the obvious truth. Whacker and his
colleague desired to be rid of one who threatened to ruin them.
Sluggishness of decision was never a fault of Bloodâ€™s. He leapt where
another crawled. And so this thought of evasion never entertained until
planted there now by Dr. Whacker sprouted into instant growth.
NA
explaining, and to save Dr. Whackerâ€™s face he played the hypocrite. â€œIt
is very noble in you--very brotherly, as between men of medicine. It is

The hard eyes flashed, the husky voice grew tremulous as the other asked
almost too eagerly:

NA

NA
NA
â€œIt shall be forthcoming. It shall be a loan, which you shall repay
NA
NA
understanding. The other doctor was also in the business.
They were approaching the peopled part of the mole. Quickly, but
eloquently, Blood expressed his thanks, where he knew that no thanks
were due.
NA
NA
In that at least he tittered no more than the bare truth, and expressed
it very baldly. It was, indeed, as if a door had been suddenly flung
open to the sunlight for escape from a dark prison in which a man had
thought to spend his life.
He was in haste now to be alone, to straighten out his agitated mind
and plan coherently what was to be done. Also he must consult another.
Already he had hit upon that other. For such a voyage a navigator would
be necessary, and a navigator was ready to his hand in Jeremy Pitt. The
first thing was to take counsel with the young shipmaster, who must be
associated with him in this business if it were to be undertaken. All
that day his mind was in turmoil with this new hope, and he was sick
with impatience for night and a chance to discuss the matter with
his chosen partner. As a result Blood was betimes that evening in the
spacious stockade that enclosed the huts of the slaves together with the
big white house of the overseer, and he found an opportunity of a few
words with Pitt, unobserved by the others.
â€œTo-night when all are asleep, come to my cabin. I have something to say
NA
The young man stared at him, roused by Bloodâ€™s pregnant tone out of the
mental lethargy into which he had of late been lapsing as a result of
the dehumanizing life he lived. Then he nodded understanding and assent,
and they moved apart.
The six months of plantation life in Barbados had made an almost tragic
mark upon the young seaman. His erstwhile bright alertness was
all departed. His face was growing vacuous, his eyes were dull and
lack-lustre, and he moved in a cringing, furtive manner, like an
over-beaten dog. He had survived the ill-nourishment, the excessive
work on the sugar plantation under a pitiless sun, the lashes of the
overseerâ€™s whip when his labours flagged, and the deadly, unrelieved
animal life to which he was condemned. But the price he was paying for
survival was the usual price. He was in danger of becoming no better
than an animal, of sinking to the level of the negroes who sometimes
toiled beside him. The man, however, was still there, not yet dormant,
but merely torpid from a surfeit of despair; and the man in him promptly
shook off that torpidity and awoke at the first words Blood spoke to him
that night--awoke and wept.
NA
sobbing like a child.
NA
the ladâ€™s blubbering. He crossed to Pittâ€™s side, and set a restraining
hand upon his shoulder. â€œFor Godâ€™s sake, command yourself. If weâ€™re
NA
Among the privileges enjoyed by Blood was that of a hut to himself, and
they were alone in this. But, after all, it was built of wattles thinly
plastered with mud, and its door was composed of bamboos, through which
sound passed very easily. Though the stockade was locked for the night,
and all within it asleep by now--it was after midnight--yet a prowling
overseer was not impossible, and a sound of voices must lead to
discovery. Pitt realized this, and controlled his outburst of emotion.
Sitting close thereafter they talked in whispers for an hour or more,
and all the while those dulled wits of Pittâ€™s were sharpening themselves
anew upon this precious whetstone of hope. They would need to recruit
others into their enterprise, a half-dozen at least, a half-score if
possible, but no more than that. They must pick the best out of that
score of survivors of the Monmouth men that Colonel Bishop had acquired.
Men who understood the sea were desirable. But of these there were only
two in that unfortunate gang, and their knowledge was none too full.
They were Hagthorpe, a gentleman who had served in the Royal Navy, and
Nicholas Dyke, who had been a petty officer in the late kingâ€™s time, and
there was another who had been a gunner, a man named Ogle.
It was agreed before they parted that Pitt should begin with these three
and then proceed to recruit some six or eight others. He was to move
with the utmost caution, sounding his men very carefully before making
anything in the nature of a disclosure, and even then avoid rendering
that disclosure so full that its betrayal might frustrate the plans
which as yet had to be worked out in detail. Labouring with them in
the plantations, Pitt would not want for opportunities of broaching the
matter to his fellow-slaves.
NA
parting. â€œWho goes slowly, goes safely, as the Italians have it. And
remember that if you betray yourself, you ruin all, for you are the only
NA
Pitt reassured him, and slunk off back to his own hut and the straw that
served him for a bed.
Coming next morning to the wharf, Blood found Dr. Whacker in a generous
mood. Having slept on the matter, he was prepared to advance the convict
any sum up to thirty pounds that would enable him to acquire a boat
capable of taking him away from the settlement. Blood expressed his
thanks becomingly, betraying no sign that he saw clearly into the true
reason of the otherâ€™s munificence.
NA
who will be selling me a boat and incurring the penalties in Governor
NA
Dr. Whackerâ€™s heavy face grew overcast. Thoughtfully he rubbed his chin.
â€œIâ€™ve read it--yes. And I dare not procure the boat for you. It would be
discovered. It must be. And the penalty is a fine of two hundred pounds
NA
The high hopes in Bloodâ€™s soul, began to shrink. And the shadow of his
despair overcast his face.
NA
NA
with tight lips. â€œIâ€™ve thought of it. You will see that the man who buys
the boat must be one of those who goes with you--so that he is not here
NA
â€œBut who is to go with me save men in my own case? What I cannot do,
NA
â€œThere are others detained on the island besides slaves. There are
several who are here for debt, and would be glad enough to spread
their wings. Thereâ€™s a fellow Nuttall, now, who follows the trade of
a shipwright, whom I happen to know would welcome such a chance as you
NA
â€œBut how should a debtor come with money to buy a boat? The question
NA
â€œTo be sure it will. But if you contrive shrewdly, youâ€™ll all be gone
NA
Blood nodded understanding, and the doctor, setting a hand upon his
sleeve, unfolded the scheme he had conceived.
â€œYou shall have the money from me at once. Having received it, youâ€™ll
forget that it was I who supplied it to you. You have friends in
England--relatives, perhaps--who sent it out to you through the agency
of one of your Bridgetown patients, whose name as a man of honour you
will on no account divulge lest you bring trouble upon him. That is your
NA
He paused, looking hard at Blood. Blood nodded understanding and assent.
Relieved, the doctor continued:
â€œBut there should be no questions if you go carefully to work. You
concert matters with Nuttall. You enlist him as one of your companions
and a shipwright should be a very useful member of your crew. You engage
him to discover a likely sloop whose owner is disposed to sell. Then let
your preparations all be made before the purchase is effected, so that
your escape may follow instantly upon it before the inevitable questions
NA
So well did Blood take him that within an hour he contrived to see
Nuttall, and found the fellow as disposed to the business as Dr. Whacker
had predicted. When he left the shipwright, it was agreed that Nuttall
should seek the boat required, for which Blood would at once produce the
money.
The quest took longer than was expected by Blood, who waited impatiently
with the doctorâ€™s gold concealed about his person. But at the end of
some three weeks, Nuttall--whom he was now meeting daily--informed him
that he had found a serviceable wherry, and that its owner was disposed
to sell it for twenty-two pounds. That evening, on the beach, remote
from all eyes, Peter Blood handed that sum to his new associate, and
Nuttall went off with instructions to complete the purchase late on the
following day. He was to bring the boat to the wharf, where under cover
of night Blood and his fellow-convicts would join him and make off.
Everything was ready. In the shed, from which all the wounded men had
now been removed and which had since remained untenanted, Nuttall had
concealed the necessary stores: a hundredweight of bread, a quantity
of cheese, a cask of water and some few bottles of Canary, a compass,
quadrant, chart, half-hour glass, log and line, a tarpaulin, some
carpenterâ€™s tools, and a lantern and candles. And in the stockade, all
was likewise in readiness. Hagthorpe, Dyke, and Ogle had agreed to join
the venture, and eight others had been carefully recruited. In Pittâ€™s
hut, which he shared with five other rebels-convict, all of whom were
to join in this bid for liberty, a ladder had been constructed in secret
during those nights of waiting. With this they were to surmount the
stockade and gain the open. The risk of detection, so that they made
little noise, was negligible. Beyond locking them all into that stockade
at night, there was no great precaution taken. Where, after all, could
any so foolish as to attempt escape hope to conceal himself in that
island? The chief risk lay in discovery by those of their companions
who were to be left behind. It was because of these that they must go
cautiously and in silence.
The day that was to have been their last in Barbados was a day of hope
and anxiety to the twelve associates in that enterprise, no less than to
Nuttall in the town below.
Towards sunset, having seen Nuttall depart to purchase and fetch
the sloop to the prearranged moorings at the wharf, Peter Blood came
sauntering towards the stockade, just as the slaves were being driven
in from the fields. He stood aside at the entrance to let them pass, and
beyond the message of hope flashed by his eyes, he held no communication
with them.
He entered the stockade in their wake, and as they broke their ranks
to seek their various respective huts, he beheld Colonel Bishop in talk
with Kent, the overseer. The pair were standing by the stocks, planted
in the middle of that green space for the punishment of offending
slaves.
As he advanced, Bishop turned to regard him, scowling. â€œWhere have you
NA
the Colonelâ€™s voice, yet Blood felt his heart tightening apprehensively.
NA
NA
â€œI sent for you to Dekkerâ€™s, and you were not there. You are given to
idling, my fine fellow. We shall have to quicken you one of these days
unless you cease from abusing the liberty you enjoy. Dâ€™ye forget that
NA
NA
his tongue.
NA
Remembering all that was at stake, growing suddenly conscious that
from the huts surrounding the enclosure anxious ears were listening, he
instantly practised an unusual submission.
NA
â€œAye, and youâ€™ll be sorrier yet. Thereâ€™s the Governor with an attack of
gout, screaming like a wounded horse, and you nowhere to be found. Be
off, man--away with you at speed to Government House! Youâ€™re awaited,
I tell you. Best lend him a horse, Kent, or the loutâ€™ll be all night
NA
They bustled him away, choking almost from a reluctance that he dared
not show. The thing was unfortunate; but after all not beyond remedy.
The escape was set for midnight, and he should easily be back by then.
He mounted the horse that Kent procured him, intending to make all
haste.
NA
NA
NA
Peter Bloodâ€™s heart sank like a stone through water.
NA
â€œBe off, I say. Will you stand there talking until dark? His excellency
NA
horseâ€™s quarters so brutally that the beast bounded forward all but
unseating her rider.
Peter Blood went off in a state of mind bordering on despair. And
there was occasion for it. A postponement of the escape at least until
to-morrow night was necessary now, and postponement must mean the
discovery of Nuttallâ€™s transaction and the asking of questions it would
be difficult to answer.
It was in his mind to slink back in the night, once his work at
Government House were done, and from the outside of the stockade make
known to Pitt and the others his presence, and so have them join him
that their project might still be carried out. But in this he reckoned
without the Governor, whom he found really in the thrall of a severe
attack of gout, and almost as severe an attack of temper nourished by
Bloodâ€™s delay.
The doctor was kept in constant attendance upon him until long after
midnight, when at last he was able to ease the sufferer a little by a
bleeding. Thereupon he would have withdrawn. But Steed would not hear of
it. Blood must sleep in his own chamber to be at hand in case of need.
It was as if Fate made sport of him. For that night at least the escape
must be definitely abandoned.
Not until the early hours of the morning did Peter Blood succeed in
making a temporary escape from Government House on the ground that he
required certain medicaments which he must, himself, procure from the
apothecary.
On that pretext, he made an excursion into the awakening town, and
went straight to Nuttall, whom he found in a state of livid panic. The
unfortunate debtor, who had sat up waiting through the night, conceived
that all was discovered and that his own ruin would be involved. Peter
Blood quieted his fears.
NA
he felt, â€œif I have to bleed the Governor to death. Be ready as last
NA
NA
pale, small-featured, man with weak eyes that now blinked desperately.
NA
Peter went off to the apothecary for his pretexted drugs.
Within an hour of his going came an officer of the Secretaryâ€™s to
Nuttallâ€™s miserable hovel. The seller of the boat had--as by law
required since the coming of the rebels-convict--duly reported the sale
at the Secretaryâ€™s office, so that he might obtain the reimbursement
of the ten-pound surety into which every keeper of a small boat was
compelled to enter. The Secretaryâ€™s office postponed this reimbursement
until it should have obtained confirmation of the transaction.
NA
 said the officer.
NA
of the world.
â€œYou are in no haste, it seems, to declare the same at the Secretaryâ€™s
NA
Nuttallâ€™s weak eyes blinked at a redoubled rate.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, now youâ€™re informed. See to it that you are at the Secretaryâ€™s
office before noon with the ten pounds surety into which you are obliged
NA
The pompous officer departed, leaving Nuttall in a cold perspiration
despite the heat of the morning. He was thankful that the fellow had not
asked the question he most dreaded, which was how he, a debtor, should
come by the money to buy a wherry. But this he knew was only a respite.
The question would presently be asked of a certainty, and then hell
would open for him. He cursed the hour in which he had been such a fool
as to listen to Peter Bloodâ€™s chatter of escape. He thought it very
likely that the whole plot would be discovered, and that he would
probably be hanged, or at least branded and sold into slavery like
those other damned rebels-convict, with whom he had been so mad as
to associate himself. If only he had the ten pounds for this
infernal surety, which until this moment had never entered into their
calculations, it was possible that the thing might be done quickly
and questions postponed until later. As the Secretaryâ€™s messenger had
overlooked the fact that he was a debtor, so might the others at the
Secretaryâ€™s office, at least for a day or two; and in that time he
would, he hoped, be beyond the reach of their questions. But in the
meantime what was to be done about this money? And it was to be found
before noon!
Nuttall snatched up his hat, and went out in quest of Peter Blood.
But where look for him? Wandering aimlessly up the irregular, unpaved
street, he ventured to enquire of one or two if they had seen Dr. Blood
that morning. He affected to be feeling none so well, and indeed his
appearance bore out the deception. None could give him information; and
since Blood had never told him of Whackerâ€™s share in this business, he
walked in his unhappy ignorance past the door of the one man in Barbados
who would eagerly have saved him in this extremity.
Finally he determined to go up to Colonel Bishopâ€™s plantation. Probably
Blood would be there. If he were not, Nuttall would find Pitt, and leave
a message with him. He was acquainted with Pitt and knew of Pittâ€™s share
in this business. His pretext for seeking Blood must still be that he
needed medical assistance.
And at the same time that he set out, insensitive in his anxiety to the
broiling heat, to climb the heights to the north of the town, Blood
was setting out from Government House at last, having so far eased the
Governorâ€™s condition as to be permitted to depart. Being mounted, he
would, but for an unexpected delay, have reached the stockade ahead of
Nuttall, in which case several unhappy events might have been averted.
The unexpected delay was occasioned by Miss Arabella Bishop.
They met at the gate of the luxuriant garden of Government House, and
Miss Bishop, herself mounted, stared to see Peter Blood on horseback.
It happened that he was in good spirits. The fact that the Governorâ€™s
condition had so far improved as to restore him his freedom of movement
had sufficed to remove the depression under which he had been labouring
for the past twelve hours and more. In its rebound the mercury of his
mood had shot higher far than present circumstances warranted. He was
disposed to be optimistic. What had failed last night would certainly
not fail again to-night. What was a day, after all? The Secretaryâ€™s
office might be troublesome, but not really troublesome for another
twenty-four hours at least; and by then they would be well away.
This joyous confidence of his was his first misfortune. The next was
that his good spirits were also shared by Miss Bishop, and that she
bore no rancour. The two things conjoined to make the delay that in its
consequences was so deplorable.

â€œNay, sir, that is an evasion. You shall answer me truthfully this
NA
â€œTruthfully? To answer you at all is a labour. But to answer truthfully!

â€œBad cess to your memory. Is there no good in me at all that you could

to leave her.
NA
NA
NA
â€œThatâ€™s merely a diversion, I think. By trade I am a soldier--at least,
itâ€™s a trade I followed for ten years. It brought me no great gear,
but it served me better than medicine, which, as you may observe, has
brought me into slavery. Iâ€™m thinking itâ€™s more pleasing in the sight of

NA
â€œI am Irish, you see, and I studied medicine. Therefore--since itâ€™s a
perverse nation we are--.... Oh, but itâ€™s a long story, and the Colonel
NA
of her entertainment. If he would wait a moment they would ride back
together. She had but come to enquire of the Governorâ€™s health at her
uncleâ€™s request.
So he waited, and so they rode back together to Colonel Bishopâ€™s house.
They rode very slowly, at a walking pace, and some whom they passed
marvelled to see the doctor-slave on such apparently intimate terms with
his ownerâ€™s niece. One or two may have promised themselves that they
would drop a hint to the Colonel. But the two rode oblivious of all
others in the world that morning. He was telling her the story of his
early turbulent days, and at the end of it he dwelt more fully than
hitherto upon the manner of his arrest and trial.
The tale was barely done when they drew up at the Colonelâ€™s door, and
dismounted, Peter Blood surrendering his nag to one of the negro grooms,
who informed them that the Colonel was from home at the moment.
Even then they lingered a moment, she detaining him.
NA
was a suspicion of moisture in those clear hazel eyes. With a compelling
friendliness she held out her hand to him.
NA
NA
NA
NA
 he said, with a significance which brought a tinge of colour to her
cheeks and a flutter to her eyelids.
He stooped to kiss her hand before releasing it, and she did not deny
him. Then he turned and strode off towards the stockade a half-mile
away, and a vision of her face went with him, tinted with a rising blush
and a sudden unusual shyness. He forgot in that little moment that he
was a rebel-convict with ten years of slavery before him; he forgot
that he had planned an escape, which was to be carried into effect
that night; forgot even the peril of discovery which as a result of the
Governorâ€™s gout now overhung him.
CHAPTER VII. PIRATES
Mr. James Nuttall made all speed, regardless of the heat, in his journey
from Bridgetown to Colonel Bishopâ€™s plantation, and if ever man was
built for speed in a hot climate that man was Mr. James Nuttall, with
his short, thin body, and his long, fleshless legs. So withered was
he that it was hard to believe there were any juices left in him, yet
juices there must have been, for he was sweating violently by the time
he reached the stockade.
At the entrance he almost ran into the overseer Kent, a squat,
bow-legged animal with the arms of a Hercules and the jowl of a bulldog.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
ungracious beast at all times, readier with the lash of his whip than
with his tongue.
Nuttall watched him go with satisfaction, and even noted the direction
that he took. Then he plunged into the enclosure, to verify in
mortification that Dr. Blood was not at home. A man of sense might have
sat down and waited, judging that to be the quickest and surest way in
the end. But Nuttall had no sense. He flung out of the stockade again,
hesitated a moment as to which direction he should take, and finally
decided to go any way but the way that Kent had gone. He sped across
the parched savannah towards the sugar plantation which stood solid as
a rampart and gleaming golden in the dazzling June sunshine. Avenues
intersected the great blocks of ripening amber cane. In the distance
down one of these he espied some slaves at work. Nuttall entered the
avenue and advanced upon them. They eyed him dully, as he passed them.
Pitt was not of their number, and he dared not ask for him. He continued
his search for best part of an hour, up one of those lanes and then
down another. Once an overseer challenged him, demanding to know his
business. He was looking, he said, for Dr. Blood. His cousin was
taken ill. The overseer bade him go to the devil, and get out of the
plantation. Blood was not there. If he was anywhere he would be in his
hut in the stockade.
Nuttall passed on, upon the understanding that he would go. But he went
in the wrong direction; he went on towards the side of the plantation
farthest from the stockade, towards the dense woods that fringed it
there. The overseer was too contemptuous and perhaps too languid in the
stifling heat of approaching noontide to correct his course.
Nuttall blundered to the end of the avenue, and round the corner of
it, and there ran into Pitt, alone, toiling with a wooden spade upon an
irrigation channel. A pair of cotton drawers, loose and ragged, clothed
him from waist to knee; above and below he was naked, save for a broad
hat of plaited straw that sheltered his unkempt golden head from the
rays of the tropical sun. At sight of him Nuttall returned thanks aloud
to his Maker. Pitt stared at him, and the shipwright poured out his
dismal news in a dismal tone. The sum of it was that he must have ten
pounds from Blood that very morning or they were all undone. And all he
got for his pains and his sweat was the condemnation of Jeremy Pitt.
NA
NA
NA
He forgot the jangled state of the otherâ€™s nerves after a night of
anxious wakefulness ending in a dawn of despair. â€œI thought that
NA
â€œYou thought that I could drop my spade and go and seek him for you? Is
that what you thought? My God! that our lives should depend upon such a
dummerhead. While you waste your time here, the hours are passing! And
NA
For a moment Nuttall was bereft of speech by such ingratitude. Then he
exploded.
â€œI would to Heaven I had never had no hand in this affair. I would so! I
NA
What else he wished was never known, for at that moment round the block
of cane came a big man in biscuit-coloured taffetas followed by two
negroes in cotton drawers who were armed with cutlasses. He was not
ten yards away, but his approach over the soft, yielding marl had been
unheard.
Mr. Nuttall looked wildly this way and that a moment, then bolted like
a rabbit for the woods, thus doing the most foolish and betraying thing
that in the circumstances it was possible for him to do. Pitt groaned
and stood still, leaning upon his spade.
NA
horrible threats tricked out with some rhetorical indecencies.
But the fugitive held amain, and never so much as turned his head. It
was his only remaining hope that Colonel Bishop might not have seen his
face; for the power and influence of Colonel Bishop was quite sufficient
to hang any man whom he thought would be better dead.
Not until the runagate had vanished into the scrub did the planter
sufficiently recover from his indignant amazement to remember the two
negroes who followed at his heels like a brace of hounds. It was a
bodyguard without which he never moved in his plantations since a slave
had made an attack upon him and all but strangled him a couple of years
ago.
NA
NA
It occurred to him that to catch and deal with the fellow there was not
the need to go after him, and perhaps spend the day hunting him in that
cursed wood. There was Pitt here ready to his hand, and Pitt should tell
him the identity of his bashful friend, and also the subject of that
close and secret talk he had disturbed. Pitt might, of course, be
reluctant. So much the worse for Pitt. The ingenious Colonel Bishop knew
a dozen ways--some of them quite diverting--of conquering stubbornness
in these convict dogs.
He turned now upon the slave a countenance that was inflamed by heat
internal and external, and a pair of heady eyes that were alight with
cruel intelligence. He stepped forward swinging his light bamboo cane.
NA
his spade, Jeremy Pitt hung his head a little, and shifted uncomfortably
on his bare feet. Vainly he groped for an answer in a mind that could do
nothing but curse the idiocy of Mr. James Nuttall.
The planterâ€™s bamboo cane fell on the ladâ€™s naked shoulders with
stinging force.
NA
Jeremy looked at the burly planter out of sullen, almost defiant eyes.
NA
least of the defiance aroused in him by a blow which he dared not, for
his lifeâ€™s sake, return. His body had remained unyielding under it, but
the spirit within writhed now in torment.
NA
NA
NA
NA
mastered him. â€œâ€˜Swounds! You impudent dog! Dâ€™you trifle with me? Dâ€™you
NA
Pitt shrugged, shifted sideways on his feet again, and settled into
dogged silence. Few things are more provocative; and Colonel Bishopâ€™s
temper was never one that required much provocation. Brute fury now
awoke in him. Fiercely now he lashed those defenceless shoulders,
accompanying each blow by blasphemy and foul abuse, until, stung beyond
endurance, the lingering embers of his manhood fanned into momentary
flame, Pitt sprang upon his tormentor.
But as he sprang, so also sprang the watchful blacks. Muscular bronze
arms coiled crushingly about the frail white body, and in a moment the
unfortunate slave stood powerless, his wrists pinioned behind him in a
leathern thong.
Breathing hard, his face mottled, Bishop pondered him a moment. Then:
NA
Down the long avenue between those golden walls of cane standing some
eight feet high, the wretched Pitt was thrust by his black captors in
the Colonelâ€™s wake, stared at with fearful eyes by his fellow-slaves at
work there. Despair went with him. What torments might immediately await
him he cared little, horrible though he knew they would be. The real
source of his mental anguish lay in the conviction that the elaborately
planned escape from this unutterable hell was frustrated now in the very
moment of execution.
They came out upon the green plateau and headed for the stockade and
the overseerâ€™s white house. Pittâ€™s eyes looked out over Carlisle Bay, of
which this plateau commanded a clear view from the fort on one side to
the long sheds of the wharf on the other. Along this wharf a few shallow
boats were moored, and Pitt caught himself wondering which of these was
the wherry in which with a little luck they might have been now at sea.
Out over that sea his glance ranged miserably.
In the roads, standing in for the shore before a gentle breeze that
scarcely ruffled the sapphire surface of the Caribbean, came a stately
red-hulled frigate, flying the English ensign.
Colonel Bishop halted to consider her, shading his eyes with his fleshly
hand. Light as was the breeze, the vessel spread no canvas to it beyond
that of her foresail. Furled was her every other sail, leaving a clear
view of the majestic lines of her hull, from towering stern castle to
gilded beakhead that was aflash in the dazzling sunshine.
So leisurely an advance argued a master indifferently acquainted with
these waters, who preferred to creep forward cautiously, sounding his
way. At her present rate of progress it would be an hour, perhaps,
before she came to anchorage within the harbour. And whilst the Colonel
viewed her, admiring, perhaps, the gracious beauty of her, Pitt was
hurried forward into the stockade, and clapped into the stocks that
stood there ready for slaves who required correction.
Colonel Bishop followed him presently, with leisurely, rolling gait.
â€œA mutinous cur that shows his fangs to his master must learn good
NA
about his executionerâ€™s job.
That with his own hands he should do that which most men of his station
would, out of self-respect, have relegated to one of the negroes, gives
you the measure of the manâ€™s beastliness. It was almost as if with
relish, as if gratifying some feral instinct of cruelty, that he now
lashed his victim about head and shoulders. Soon his cane was reduced,
to splinters by his violence. You know, perhaps, the sting of a flexible
bamboo cane when it is whole. But do you realize its murderous quality
when it has been split into several long lithe blades, each with an edge
that is of the keenness of a knife?
When, at last, from very weariness, Colonel Bishop flung away the stump
and thongs to which his cane had been reduced, the wretched slaveâ€™s back
was bleeding pulp from neck to waist.
As long as full sensibility remained, Jeremy Pitt had made no sound.
But in a measure as from pain his senses were mercifully dulled, he sank
forward in the stocks, and hung there now in a huddled heap, faintly
moaning.
Colonel Bishop set his foot upon the crossbar, and leaned over his
victim, a cruel smile on his full, coarse face.
NA
that shy friend of yours, you shall stay here without meat or
drink--without meat or drink, dâ€™ ye hear me?--until you please to tell
NA
had enough of this, send me word, and weâ€™ll have the branding-irons to
NA
On that he swung on his heel, and strode out of the stockade, his
negroes following.
Pitt had heard him, as we hear things in our dreams. At the moment so
spent was he by his cruel punishment, and so deep was the despair into
which he had fallen, that he no longer cared whether he lived or died.
Soon, however, from the partial stupor which pain had mercifully
induced, a new variety of pain aroused him. The stocks stood in the
open under the full glare of the tropical sun, and its blistering rays
streamed down upon that mangled, bleeding back until he felt as if
flames of fire were searing it. And, soon, to this was added a torment
still more unspeakable. Flies, the cruel flies of the Antilles, drawn by
the scent of blood, descended in a cloud upon him.
Small wonder that the ingenious Colonel Bishop, who so well understood
the art of loosening stubborn tongues, had not deemed it necessary to
have recourse to other means of torture. Not all his fiendish cruelty
could devise a torment more cruel, more unendurable than the torments
Nature would here procure a man in Pittâ€™s condition.
The slave writhed in his stocks until he was in danger of breaking his
limbs, and writhing, screamed in agony.
Thus was he found by Peter Blood, who seemed to his troubled vision
to materialize suddenly before him. Mr. Blood carried a large palmetto
leaf. Having whisked away with this the flies that were devouring
Jeremyâ€™s back, he slung it by a strip of fibre from the ladâ€™s neck, so
that it protected him from further attacks as well as from the rays of
the sun. Next, sitting down beside him, he drew the suffererâ€™s head down
on his own shoulder, and bathed his face from a pannikin of cold water.
Pitt shuddered and moaned on a long, indrawn breath.
NA
held to his quivering lips. He drank greedily, noisily, nor ceased
until he had drained the vessel. Cooled and revived by the draught, he
attempted to sit up.
NA
There was an unusual glint in Mr. Bloodâ€™s eyes; his lips were
compressed. But when he parted them to speak, his voice came cool and
steady.
â€œBe easy, now. One thing at a time. Your backâ€™s taking no harm at all
for the present, since Iâ€™ve covered it up. Iâ€™m wanting to know whatâ€™s
happened to you. Dâ€™ ye think we can do without a navigator that ye go
NA
Pitt sat up and groaned again. But this time his anguish was mental
rather than physical.
NA
NA
Pitt explained the situation as briefly as he could, in a halting,
gasping speech. â€œIâ€™m to rot here until I tell him the identity of my

Mr. Blood got up, growling in his throat. â€œBad cess to the filthy

explains it or not, the boat remains, and weâ€™re going, and youâ€™re coming
NA
NA
The magistrates will confiscate the boat since the suretyâ€™s not paid,
even if when they press him Nuttall does not confess the whole plan and
NA
Mr. Blood turned away, and with agony in his eyes looked out to sea over
the blue water by which he had so fondly hoped soon to be travelling
back to freedom.
The great red ship had drawn considerably nearer shore by now. Slowly,
majestically, she was entering the bay. Already one or two wherries were
putting off from the wharf to board her. From where he stood, Mr. Blood
could see the glinting of the brass cannons mounted on the prow above
the curving beak-head, and he could make out the figure of a seaman in
the forechains on her larboard side, leaning out to heave the lead.
An angry voice aroused him from his unhappy thoughts.
NA
The returning Colonel Bishop came striding into the stockade, his
negroes following ever.
Mr. Blood turned to face him, and over that swarthy countenance--which,
indeed, by now was tanned to the golden brown of a half-caste Indian--a
mask descended.
NA
The Colonel, striding furiously forward, observed two things. The
empty pannikin on the seat beside the prisoner, and the palmetto leaf

slaves was being murthered by the sun and the flies. And I says to

doctor, and sure itâ€™s my duty to be looking after the Colonelâ€™s
property. So I just gave the fellow a spoonful of water and covered his

tore the palmetto leaf from the prisonerâ€™s back.

He was terrific in his menace, in his bulk, and in the power of him. But
Mr. Blood never flinched. It came to the Colonel, as he found himself
steadily regarded by those light-blue eyes that looked so arrestingly
odd in that tawny face--like pale sapphires set in copper--that this
rogue had for some time now been growing presumptuous. It was a matter
that he must presently correct. Meanwhile Mr. Blood was speaking again,
his tone quietly insistent.

duties of a doctor, and that itâ€™s devil another patient will I attend in

For an instant the Colonel was too amazed to speak. Then--

Colonelâ€™s, and there was a devil peeping out of them, the devil of
recklessness that is born of despair.
Colonel Bishop considered him for a long moment in silence. â€œIâ€™ve been

Mr. Blood actually laughed. â€œAnd will ye tell that to his excellency,

well itâ€™s devil another doctor will he tolerate, being an intelligent

But the Colonelâ€™s brute passion thoroughly aroused was not so easily to
be baulked. â€œIf youâ€™re alive when my blacks have done with you, perhaps
NA
He swung to his negroes to issue an order. But it was never issued. At
that moment a terrific rolling thunderclap drowned his voice and shook
the very air. Colonel Bishop jumped, his negroes jumped with him, and so
even did the apparently imperturbable Mr. Blood. Then the four of them
stared together seawards.
Down in the bay all that could be seen of the great ship, standing now
within a cableâ€™s-length of the fort, were her topmasts thrusting above
a cloud of smoke in which she was enveloped. From the cliffs a flight
of startled seabirds had risen to circle in the blue, giving tongue to
their alarm, the plaintive curlew noisiest of all.
As those men stared from the eminence on which they stood, not yet
understanding what had taken place, they saw the British Jack dip from
the main truck and vanish into the rising cloud below. A moment more,
and up through that cloud to replace the flag of England soared the gold
and crimson banner of Castile. And then they understood.
NA
Fear and incredulity were blent in his voice. He had paled under his tan
until his face was the colour of clay, and there was a wild fury in his
beady eyes. His negroes looked at him, grinning idiotically, all teeth
and eyeballs.
CHAPTER VIII. SPANIARDS
The stately ship that had been allowed to sail so leisurely into
Carlisle Bay under her false colours was a Spanish privateer, coming to
pay off some of the heavy debt piled up by the predaceous Brethren of
the Coast, and the recent defeat by the Pride of Devon of two treasure
galleons bound for Cadiz. It happened that the galleon which escaped in
a more or less crippled condition was commanded by Don Diego de Espinosa
y Valdez, who was own brother to the Spanish Admiral Don Miguel de
Espinosa, and who was also a very hasty, proud, and hot-tempered
gentleman.
Galled by his defeat, and choosing to forget that his own conduct had
invited it, he had sworn to teach the English a sharp lesson which they
should remember. He would take a leaf out of the book of Morgan and
those other robbers of the sea, and make a punitive raid upon an English
settlement. Unfortunately for himself and for many others, his brother
the Admiral was not at hand to restrain him when for this purpose he
fitted out the Cinco Llagas at San Juan de Porto Rico. He chose for
his objective the island of Barbados, whose natural strength was apt to
render her defenders careless. He chose it also because thither had the
Pride of Devon been tracked by his scouts, and he desired a measure of
poetic justice to invest his vengeance. And he chose a moment when there
were no ships of war at anchor in Carlisle Bay.
He had succeeded so well in his intentions that he had aroused no
suspicion until he saluted the fort at short range with a broadside of
twenty guns.
And now the four gaping watchers in the stockade on the headland beheld
the great ship creep forward under the rising cloud of smoke,
her mainsail unfurled to increase her steering way, and go about
close-hauled to bring her larboard guns to bear upon the unready fort.
With the crashing roar of that second broadside, Colonel Bishop awoke
from stupefaction to a recollection of where his duty lay. In the town
below drums were beating frantically, and a trumpet was bleating, as
if the peril needed further advertising. As commander of the Barbados
Militia, the place of Colonel Bishop was at the head of his scanty
troops, in that fort which the Spanish guns were pounding into rubble.
Remembering it, he went off at the double, despite his bulk and the
heat, his negroes trotting after him.
NA
NA
NA
As a third broadside was thundering forth, he picked up the palmetto
leaf and carefully replaced it on the back of his fellow-slave.
And then into the stockade, panting and sweating, came Kent followed by
best part of a score of plantation workers, some of whom were black and
all of whom were in a state of panic. He led them into the low white
house, to bring them forth again, within a moment, as it seemed, armed
now with muskets and hangers and some of them equipped with bandoleers.
By this time the rebels-convict were coming in, in twos and threes,
having abandoned their work upon finding themselves unguarded and upon
scenting the general dismay.
Kent paused a moment, as his hastily armed guard dashed forth, to fling
an order to those slaves.
NA
NA
On that he went off in haste after his men, who were to be added to
those massing in the town, so as to oppose and overwhelm the Spanish
landing parties.
The slaves would have obeyed him on the instant but for Mr. Blood.
NA
cool, they thought. â€œMaybe thereâ€™ll be no need to take to the woods at
all, and, anyway, it will be time enough to do so when the Spaniards are
NA
And so, joined now by the other stragglers, and numbering in all a
round score--rebels-convict all--they stayed to watch from their
vantage-ground the fortunes of the furious battle that was being waged
below.
The landing was contested by the militia and by every islander capable
of bearing arms with the fierce resoluteness of men who knew that
no quarter was to be expected in defeat. The ruthlessness of Spanish
soldiery was a byword, and not at his worst had Morgan or Lâ€™Ollonais
ever perpetrated such horrors as those of which these Castilian
gentlemen were capable.
But this Spanish commander knew his business, which was more than could
truthfully be said for the Barbados Militia. Having gained the advantage
of a surprise blow, which had put the fort out of action, he soon showed
them that he was master of the situation. His guns turned now upon the
open space behind the mole, where the incompetent Bishop had marshalled
his men, tore the militia into bloody rags, and covered the landing
parties which were making the shore in their own boats and in several
of those which had rashly gone out to the great ship before her identity
was revealed.
All through the scorching afternoon the battle went on, the rattle and
crack of musketry penetrating ever deeper into the town to show that
the defenders were being driven steadily back. By sunset two hundred and
fifty Spaniards were masters of Bridgetown, the islanders were disarmed,
and at Government House, Governor Steed--his gout forgotten in his
panic--supported by Colonel Bishop and some lesser officers, was being
informed by Don Diego, with an urbanity that was itself a mockery, of
the sum that would be required in ransom.
For a hundred thousand pieces of eight and fifty head of cattle, Don
Diego would forbear from reducing the place to ashes. And what time
that suave and courtly commander was settling these details with the
apoplectic British Governor, the Spaniards were smashing and looting,
feasting, drinking, and ravaging after the hideous manner of their kind.
Mr. Blood, greatly daring, ventured down at dusk into the town. What
he saw there is recorded by Jeremy Pitt to whom he subsequently related
it--in that voluminous log from which the greater part of my narrative
is derived. I have no intention of repeating any of it here. It is
all too loathsome and nauseating, incredible, indeed, that men however
abandoned could ever descend such an abyss of bestial cruelty and lust.
What he saw was fetching him in haste and white-faced out of that hell
again, when in a narrow street a girl hurtled into him, wild-eyed, her
unbound hair streaming behind her as she ran. After her, laughing and
cursing in a breath, came a heavy-booted Spaniard. Almost he was upon
her, when suddenly Mr. Blood got in his way. The doctor had taken a
sword from a dead manâ€™s side some little time before and armed himself
with it against an emergency.
As the Spaniard checked in anger and surprise, he caught in the dusk the
livid gleam of that sword which Mr. Blood had quickly unsheathed.
NA
NA
Blood, and ran him through the body. He did the thing skilfully: with
the combined skill of swordsman and surgeon. The man sank in a hideous
heap without so much as a groan.
Mr. Blood swung to the girl, who leaned panting and sobbing against a
wall. He caught her by the wrist.
NA
NA
demanded wildly.
NA
towards them from beyond the corner round which she had fled from
NA
perhaps by his clear English speech, she went without further questions.
They sped down an alley and then up another, by great good fortune
meeting no one, for already they were on the outskirts of the town. They
won out of it, and white-faced, physically sick, Mr. Blood dragged her
almost at a run up the hill towards Colonel Bishopâ€™s house. He told her
briefly who and what he was, and thereafter there was no conversation
between them until they reached the big white house. It was all in
darkness, which at least was reassuring. If the Spaniards had reached
it, there would be lights. He knocked, but had to knock again and yet
again before he was answered. Then it was by a voice from a window
above.
NA
unmistakably her own.
Mr. Blood almost fainted in relief. He had been imagining the
unimaginable. He had pictured her down in that hell out of which he had
just come. He had conceived that she might have followed her uncle into
Bridgetown, or committed some other imprudence, and he turned cold from
head to foot at the mere thought of what might have happened to her.
NA
NA
It is doubtful whether she would have come down to open. For at such
a time as this it was no more than likely that the wretched plantation
slaves might be in revolt and prove as great a danger as the Spaniards.
But at the sound of her voice, the girl Mr. Blood had rescued peered up
through the gloom.
NA
NA
withdrawn. After a brief pause the door gaped wide. Beyond it in
the wide hall stood Miss Arabella, a slim, virginal figure in white,
mysteriously revealed in the gleam of a single candle which she carried.
Mr. Blood strode in followed by his distraught companion, who, falling
upon Arabellaâ€™s slender bosom, surrendered herself to a passion of
tears. But he wasted no time.

him.

He paused. He turned and came slowly back. Standing above her he smiled
upon her.

The horses came at last--four of them, for in addition to James who was
to act as her guide, Miss Bishop had her woman, who was not to be left
behind.
Mr. Blood lifted the slight weight of Mary Traill to her horse, then
turned to say good-bye to Miss Bishop, who was already mounted. He
said it, and seemed to have something to add. But whatever it was, it
remained unspoken. The horses started, and receded into the sapphire
starlit night, leaving him standing there before Colonel Bishopâ€™s door.
The last he heard of them was Mary Traillâ€™s childlike voice calling back
on a quavering note--
NA
But as it was not the voice he desired to hear, the assurance brought
him little satisfaction. He stood there in the dark watching the
fireflies amid the rhododendrons, till the hoofbeats had faded. Then he
sighed and roused himself. He had much to do. His journey into the town
had not been one of idle curiosity to see how the Spaniards conducted
themselves in victory. It had been inspired by a very different purpose,
and he had gained in the course of it all the information he desired. He
had an extremely busy night before him, and must be moving.
He went off briskly in the direction of the stockade, where his
fellow-slaves awaited him in deep anxiety and some hope.
CHAPTER IX. THE REBELS-CONVICT
There were, when the purple gloom of the tropical night descended upon
the Caribbean, not more than ten men on guard aboard the Cinco Llagas,
so confident--and with good reason--were the Spaniards of the complete
subjection of the islanders. And when I say that there were ten men on
guard, I state rather the purpose for which they were left aboard than
the duty which they fulfilled. As a matter of fact, whilst the main body
of the Spaniards feasted and rioted ashore, the Spanish gunner and his
crew--who had so nobly done their duty and ensured the easy victory of
the day--were feasting on the gun-deck upon the wine and the fresh meats
fetched out to them from shore. Above, two sentinels only kept vigil, at
stem and stern. Nor were they as vigilant as they should have been, or
else they must have observed the two wherries that under cover of the
darkness came gliding from the wharf, with well-greased rowlocks, to
bring up in silence under the great shipâ€™s quarter.
From the gallery aft still hung the ladder by which Don Diego had
descended to the boat that had taken him ashore. The sentry on guard in
the stern, coming presently round this gallery, was suddenly confronted
by the black shadow of a man standing before him at the head of the
ladder.
NA
fellows.
NA
he was master.
NA
NA
NA
NA
The wooden taffrail was a low one, and the Spaniard was taken completely
by surprise. Save for the splash he made as he struck the water,
narrowly missing one of the crowded boats that waited under the counter,
not a sound announced his misadventure. Armed as he was with corselet,
cuissarts, and headpiece, he sank to trouble them no more.
NA
NA
Within five minutes they had swarmed aboard, the entire twenty of them
overflowing from that narrow gallery and crouching on the quarter-deck
itself. Lights showed ahead. Under the great lantern in the prow they
saw the black figure of the other sentry, pacing on the forecastle. From
below sounds reached them of the orgy on the gun-deck: a rich male voice
was singing an obscene ballad to which the others chanted in chorus:
NA
NA
NA
Crouching low, they glided, noiseless as shadows, to the quarter-deck
rail, and thence slipped without sound down into the waist. Two thirds
of them were armed with muskets, some of which they had found in the
overseerâ€™s house, and others supplied from the secret hoard that Mr.
Blood had so laboriously assembled against the day of escape. The
remainder were equipped with knives and cutlasses.
In the vesselâ€™s waist they hung awhile, until Mr. Blood had satisfied
himself that no other sentinel showed above decks but that inconvenient
fellow in the prow. Their first attention must be for him. Mr. Blood,
himself, crept forward with two companions, leaving the others in the
charge of that Nathaniel Hagthorpe whose sometime commission in the
Kingâ€™s Navy gave him the best title to this office.
Mr. Bloodâ€™s absence was brief. When he rejoined his comrades there was
no watch above the Spaniardsâ€™ decks.
Meanwhile the revellers below continued to make merry at their ease
in the conviction of complete security. The garrison of Barbados was
overpowered and disarmed, and their companions were ashore in complete
possession of the town, glutting themselves hideously upon the fruits
of victory. What, then, was there to fear? Even when their quarters were
invaded and they found themselves surrounded by a score of wild,
hairy, half-naked men, who--save that they appeared once to have been
white--looked like a horde of savages, the Spaniards could not believe
their eyes.
Who could have dreamed that a handful of forgotten plantation-slaves
would have dared to take so much upon themselves?
The half-drunken Spaniards, their laughter suddenly quenched, the song
perishing on their lips, stared, stricken and bewildered at the levelled
muskets by which they were checkmated.
And then, from out of this uncouth pack of savages that beset them,
stepped a slim, tall fellow with light-blue eyes in a tawny face, eyes
in which glinted the light of a wicked humour. He addressed them in the
purest Castilian.
â€œYou will save yourselves pain and trouble by regarding yourselves my
prisoners, and suffering yourselves to be quietly bestowed out of harmâ€™s

NA
amazement beyond expression.
NA
were induced without further trouble beyond a musket prod or two to drop
through a scuttle to the deck below.
After that the rebels-convict refreshed themselves with the good things
in the consumption of which they had interrupted the Spaniards. To taste
palatable Christian food after months of salt fish and maize dumplings
was in itself a feast to these unfortunates. But there were no excesses.
Mr. Blood saw to that, although it required all the firmness of which he
was capable.
Dispositions were to be made without delay against that which must
follow before they could abandon themselves fully to the enjoyment of
their victory. This, after all, was no more than a preliminary skirmish,
although it was one that afforded them the key to the situation. It
remained to dispose so that the utmost profit might be drawn from it.
Those dispositions occupied some very considerable portion of the
night. But, at least, they were complete before the sun peeped over
the shoulder of Mount Hilibay to shed his light upon a day of some
surprises.
It was soon after sunrise that the rebel-convict who paced the
quarter-deck in Spanish corselet and headpiece, a Spanish musket on his
shoulder, announced the approach of a boat. It was Don Diego de Espinosa
y Valdez coming aboard with four great treasure-chests, containing each
twenty-five thousand pieces of eight, the ransom delivered to him at
dawn by Governor Steed. He was accompanied by his son, Don Esteban, and
by six men who took the oars.
Aboard the frigate all was quiet and orderly as it should be. She
rode at anchor, her larboard to the shore, and the main ladder on her
starboard side. Round to this came the boat with Don Diego and his
treasure. Mr. Blood had disposed effectively. It was not for nothing
that he had served under de Ruyter. The swings were waiting, and the
windlass manned. Below, a gun-crew held itself in readiness under the
command of Ogle, who--as I have said--had been a gunner in the Royal
Navy before he went in for politics and followed the fortunes of
the Duke of Monmouth. He was a sturdy, resolute fellow who inspired
confidence by the very confidence he displayed in himself.
Don Diego mounted the ladder and stepped upon the deck, alone, and
entirely unsuspicious. What should the poor man suspect?
Before he could even look round, and survey this guard drawn up to
receive him, a tap over the head with a capstan bar efficiently handled
by Hagthorpe put him to sleep without the least fuss.
He was carried away to his cabin, whilst the treasure-chests, handled
by the men he had left in the boat, were being hauled to the deck. That
being satisfactorily accomplished, Don Esteban and the fellows who had
manned the boat came up the ladder, one by one, to be handled with the
same quiet efficiency. Peter Blood had a genius for these things, and
almost, I suspect, an eye for the dramatic. Dramatic, certainly, was the
spectacle now offered to the survivors of the raid.
With Colonel Bishop at their head, and gout-ridden Governor Steed
sitting on the ruins of a wall beside him, they glumly watched the
departure of the eight boats containing the weary Spanish ruffians who
had glutted themselves with rapine, murder, and violences unspeakable.
They looked on, between relief at this departure of their remorseless
enemies, and despair at the wild ravages which, temporarily at least,
had wrecked the prosperity and happiness of that little colony.
The boats pulled away from the shore, with their loads of laughing,
jeering Spaniards, who were still flinging taunts across the water at
their surviving victims. They had come midway between the wharf and the
ship, when suddenly the air was shaken by the boom of a gun.
A round shot struck the water within a fathom of the foremost boat,
sending a shower of spray over its occupants. They paused at their oars,
astounded into silence for a moment. Then speech burst from them like
an explosion. Angrily voluble they anathematized this dangerous
carelessness on the part of their gunner, who should know better than
to fire a salute from a cannon loaded with shot. They were still cursing
him when a second shot, better aimed than the first, came to crumple one
of the boats into splinters, flinging its crew, dead and living, into
the water.
But if it silenced these, it gave tongue, still more angry, vehement,
and bewildered to the crews of the other seven boats. From each the
suspended oars stood out poised over the water, whilst on their feet in
the excitement the Spaniards screamed oaths at the ship, begging Heaven
and Hell to inform them what madman had been let loose among her guns.
Plump into their middle came a third shot, smashing a second boat with
fearful execution. Followed again a moment of awful silence, then among
those Spanish pirates all was gibbering and jabbering and splashing of
oars, as they attempted to pull in every direction at once. Some were
for going ashore, others for heading straight to the vessel and there
discovering what might be amiss. That something was very gravely amiss
there could be no further doubt, particularly as whilst they discussed
and fumed and cursed two more shots came over the water to account for
yet a third of their boats.
The resolute Ogle was making excellent practice, and fully justifying
his claims to know something of gunnery. In their consternation the
Spaniards had simplified his task by huddling their boats together.
After the fourth shot, opinion was no longer divided amongst them. As
with one accord they went about, or attempted to do so, for before they
had accomplished it two more of their boats had been sunk.
The three boats that remained, without concerning themselves with their
more unfortunate fellows, who were struggling in the water, headed back
for the wharf at speed.
If the Spaniards understood nothing of all this, the forlorn islanders
ashore understood still less, until to help their wits they saw the flag
of Spain come down from the mainmast of the Cinco Llagas, and the
flag of England soar to its empty place. Even then some bewilderment
persisted, and it was with fearful eyes that they observed the return
of their enemies, who might vent upon them the ferocity aroused by these
extraordinary events.
Ogle, however, continued to give proof that his knowledge of gunnery was
not of yesterday. After the fleeing Spaniards went his shots. The last
of their boats flew into splinters as it touched the wharf, and its
remains were buried under a shower of loosened masonry.
That was the end of this pirate crew, which not ten minutes ago had
been laughingly counting up the pieces of eight that would fall to
the portion of each for his share in that act of villainy. Close upon
threescore survivors contrived to reach the shore. Whether they had
cause for congratulation, I am unable to say in the absence of any
records in which their fate may be traced. That lack of records is in
itself eloquent. We know that they were made fast as they landed, and
considering the offence they had given I am not disposed to doubt that
they had every reason to regret the survival.
The mystery of the succour that had come at the eleventh hour to
wreak vengeance upon the Spaniards, and to preserve for the island the
extortionate ransom of a hundred thousand pieces of eight, remained yet
to be probed. That the Cinco Llagas was now in friendly hands could no
longer be doubted after the proofs it had given. But who, the people
of Bridgetown asked one another, were the men in possession of her, and
whence had they come? The only possible assumption ran the truth very
closely. A resolute party of islanders must have got aboard during
the night, and seized the ship. It remained to ascertain the precise
identity of these mysterious saviours, and do them fitting honour.
Upon this errand--Governor Steedâ€™s condition not permitting him to go
in person--went Colonel Bishop as the Governorâ€™s deputy, attended by two
officers.
As he stepped from the ladder into the vesselâ€™s waist, the Colonel
beheld there, beside the main hatch, the four treasure-chests, the
contents of one of which had been contributed almost entirely by
himself. It was a gladsome spectacle, and his eyes sparkled in beholding
it.
Ranged on either side, athwart the deck, stood a score of men in two
well-ordered files, with breasts and backs of steel, polished Spanish
morions on their heads, overshadowing their faces, and muskets ordered
at their sides.
Colonel Bishop could not be expected to recognize at a glance in these
upright, furbished, soldierly figures the ragged, unkempt scarecrows
that but yesterday had been toiling in his plantations. Still less could
he be expected to recognize at once the courtly gentleman who advanced
to greet him--a lean, graceful gentleman, dressed in the Spanish
fashion, all in black with silver lace, a gold-hilted sword dangling
beside him from a gold embroidered baldrick, a broad castor with a
sweeping plume set above carefully curled ringlets of deepest black.

familiar addressed the planter. â€œWeâ€™ve made the best of the Spaniardsâ€™
wardrobe in honour of this visit, though it was scarcely yourself we had
dared hope to expect. You find yourself among friends--old friends of

in all this splendour--indulging therein his natural taste--his face
carefully shaven, his hair as carefully dressed, seemed transformed into
a younger man. The fact is he looked no more than the thirty-three years

tossed back the fine lace from his wrist, to wave a hand towards the
file of men standing to attention there.

of foolish jubilation. â€œAnd it was with these fellows that you took
the Spaniard and turned the tables on those dogs! Oddswounds! It was

Colonel Bishop sat himself down on the hatch-coaming, took off his broad
hat, and mopped his brow.

be something to set against the other losses we have suffered. As Gadâ€™s

face.
â€œWhy--his excellency shall write home an account of your exploit, and

Hagthorpe, who was standing by, and amongst the ranged rebels-convict
some one ventured to laugh.
Colonel Bishop started up. He was pervaded by the first pang of
uneasiness. It occurred to him that all here might not be as friendly as
appeared.
NA
a flogging thatâ€™s due to me. Yeâ€™re a man of your word in such matters,
Colonel--if not perhaps in others--and ye said, I think, that yeâ€™d not

The planter waved the matter aside. Almost it seemed to offend him.

Mr. Blood resumed: â€œyeâ€™ll please to understand that I must, Colonel,
darling. Yeâ€™ve worked a deal of wickedness and cruelty in your time, and
I want this to be a lesson to you, a lesson that yeâ€™ll remember--for
the sake of others who may come after us. Thereâ€™s Jeremy up there in the
round-house with a back thatâ€™s every colour of the rainbow; and the poor
ladâ€™ll not be himself again for a month. And if it hadnâ€™t been for the

He paused. There was no answer. But they stood hang-dog and
half-mutinous before him, save Hagthorpe, who shrugged and smiled
wearily.
Mr. Blood resumed: â€œYeâ€™ll please to understand that aboard a ship there

hostage for the good behaviour of Governor Steed and whatâ€™s left of the

war from Don Diego de Espinosa y Valdez, who is my prisoner aboard.
You are to understand that I have turned the tables on more than the
Spaniards. Thereâ€™s the ladder. Youâ€™ll find it more convenient than being
NA
They went, though not without some hustling, regardless of the
bellowings of Colonel Bishop, whose monstrous rage was fanned by terror
at finding himself at the mercy of these men of whose cause to hate him
he was very fully conscious.
A half-dozen of them, apart from Jeremy Pitt, who was utterly
incapacitated for the present, possessed a superficial knowledge
of seamanship. Hagthorpe, although he had been a fighting officer,
untrained in navigation, knew how to handle a ship, and under his
directions they set about getting under way.
The anchor catted, and the mainsail unfurled, they stood out for the
open before a gentle breeze, without interference from the fort.
As they were running close to the headland east of the bay, Peter
Blood returned to the Colonel, who, under guard and panic-stricken, had
dejectedly resumed his seat on the coamings of the main batch.
NA
Colonel Bishop looked up. His great face was yellow and seemed in that
moment of a preternatural flabbiness; his beady eyes were beadier than
ever.
â€œAs your doctor, now, I prescribe a swim to cool the excessive heat
NA
receiving still no answer from the Colonel, continued: â€œItâ€™s a mercy for
you Iâ€™m not by nature as bloodthirsty as some of my friends here. And
itâ€™s the devilâ€™s own labour Iâ€™ve had to prevail upon them not to be
NA
He was lying. He had no doubt at all. Had he followed his own wishes and
instincts, he would certainly have strung the Colonel up, and accounted
it a meritorious deed. It was the thought of Arabella Bishop that had
urged him to mercy, and had led him to oppose the natural vindictiveness
of his fellow-slaves until he had been in danger of precipitating a
mutiny. It was entirely to the fact that the Colonel was her uncle,
although he did not even begin to suspect such a cause, that he owed
such mercy as was now being shown him.
NA
not above a quarter of a mile to the headland yonder, and with ordinary
luck ye should manage it. Faith, youâ€™re fat enough to float. Come on!
Now, donâ€™t be hesitating or itâ€™s a long voyage yeâ€™ll be going with us,
and the devil knows what may happen to you. Youâ€™re not loved any more
NA
Colonel Bishop mastered himself, and rose. A merciless despot, who had
never known the need for restraint in all these years, he was doomed by
ironic fate to practise restraint in the very moment when his feelings
had reached their most violent intensity.
Peter Blood gave an order. A plank was run out over the gunwale, and
lashed down.
NA
invitation.
The Colonel looked at him, and there was hell in his glance. Then,
taking his resolve, and putting the best face upon it, since no other
could help him here, he kicked off his shoes, peeled off his fine coat
of biscuit-coloured taffetas, and climbed upon the plank.
A moment he paused, steadied by a hand that clutched the ratlines,
looking down in terror at the green water rushing past some
five-and-twenty feet below.
NA
voice behind him.
Still clinging, Colonel Bishop looked round in hesitation, and saw the
bulwarks lined with swarthy faces--the faces of men that as lately as
yesterday would have turned pale under his frown, faces that were now
all wickedly agrin.
For a moment rage stamped out his fear. He cursed them aloud venomously
and incoherently, then loosed his hold and stepped out upon the plank.
Three steps he took before he lost his balance and went tumbling into
the green depths below.
When he came to the surface again, gasping for air, the Cinco Llagas
was already some furlongs to leeward. But the roaring cheer of mocking
valediction from the rebels-convict reached him across the water, to
drive the iron of impotent rage deeper into his soul.
CHAPTER X. DON DIEGO
Don Diego de Espinosa y Valdez awoke, and with languid eyes in aching
head, he looked round the cabin, which was flooded with sunlight from
the square windows astern. Then he uttered a moan, and closed his eyes
again, impelled to this by the monstrous ache in his head. Lying thus,
he attempted to think, to locate himself in time and space. But between
the pain in his head and the confusion in his mind, he found coherent
thought impossible.
An indefinite sense of alarm drove him to open his eyes again, and once
more to consider his surroundings.
There could be no doubt that he lay in the great cabin of his own
ship, the Cinco Llagas, so that his vague disquiet must be, surely,
ill-founded. And yet, stirrings of memory coming now to the assistance
of reflection, compelled him uneasily to insist that here something was
not as it should be. The low position of the sun, flooding the cabin
with golden light from those square ports astern, suggested to him at
first that it was early morning, on the assumption that the vessel was
headed westward. Then the alternative occurred to him. They might be
sailing eastward, in which case the time of day would be late afternoon.
That they were sailing he could feel from the gentle forward heave of
the vessel under him. But how did they come to be sailing, and he, the
master, not to know whether their course lay east or west, not to be
able to recollect whither they were bound?
His mind went back over the adventure of yesterday, if of yesterday it
was. He was clear on the matter of the easily successful raid upon the
Island of Barbados; every detail stood vividly in his memory up to the
moment at which, returning aboard, he had stepped on to his own deck
again. There memory abruptly and inexplicably ceased.
He was beginning to torture his mind with conjecture, when the door
opened, and to Don Diegoâ€™s increasing mystification he beheld his best
suit of clothes step into the cabin. It was a singularly elegant and
characteristically Spanish suit of black taffetas with silver lace that
had been made for him a year ago in Cadiz, and he knew each detail of it
so well that it was impossible he could now be mistaken.
The suit paused to close the door, then advanced towards the couch on
which Don Diego was extended, and inside the suit came a tall, slender
gentleman of about Don Diegoâ€™s own height and shape. Seeing the wide,
startled eyes of the Spaniard upon him, the gentleman lengthened his
stride.
NA
The recumbent man looked up bewildered into a pair of light-blue eyes
that regarded him out of a tawny, sardonic face set in a cluster of
black ringlets. But he was too bewildered to make any answer.
The strangerâ€™s fingers touched the top of Don Diegoâ€™s head, whereupon
Don Diego winced and cried out in pain.
NA
and second finger. And then, at last, the intrigued Spaniard spoke.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Don Diego struggled up into a sitting position on the red velvet couch.
NA
NA
The level black eyebrows went up, a faint smile curled the lips of the
long mouth.
â€œYou are still delirious, I fear. This is not your ship. This is my

scanned the cabin once again, scrutinizing each familiar object. â€œAm I

NA
â€œOh, no, my name is Blood--Captain Peter Blood. This ship, like this
handsome suit of clothes, is mine by right of conquest. Just as you, Don
NA
Startling as was the explanation, yet it proved soothing to Don Diego,
being so much less startling than the things he was beginning to
imagine.
NA
â€œYou flatter my Castilian accent. I have the honour to be Irish. You
were thinking that a miracle had happened. So it has--a miracle wrought
NA
Succinctly now Captain Blood dispelled the mystery by a relation of
the facts. It was a narrative that painted red and white by turns the
Spaniardâ€™s countenance. He put a hand to the back of his head, and there
discovered, in confirmation of the story, a lump as large as a pigeonâ€™s
egg. Lastly, he stared wild-eyed at the sardonic Captain Blood.
NA
NA
â€œYour son is safe; he and the boatâ€™s crew together with your gunner and
NA
Don Diego sank back on the couch, his glittering dark eyes fixed upon
the tawny face above him. He composed himself. After all, he possessed
the stoicism proper to his desperate trade. The dice had fallen against
him in this venture. The tables had been turned upon him in the very
moment of success. He accepted the situation with the fortitude of a
fatalist.
With the utmost calm he enquired:

NA

from the tap we gave you. For it means that youâ€™ll be put to the trouble

Captain Blood perched himself on the edge of the long oak table. â€œBut

More than that, she is none so well found in water and provisions. True,
we are fortunately a small number, but you and your party inconveniently

us that we should deny ourselves the pleasure of your company, and,
steeling our soft hearts to the inevitable, invite you to be so obliging

NA
and sat now upon the edge of it, his elbows on his knees. He had taken
the measure of his man, and met him with a mock-urbanity and a suave

NA

unnecessarily harsh, especially since I and my friends owe you so very
much. For, whatever it may have been to others, to us your raid upon
Barbados was most opportune. I am glad, therefore, that you agree the I

NA
â€œIf there is any alternative that you can suggest, I shall be most happy
NA
Don Diego stroked his pointed black beard.
â€œCan you give me until morning for reflection? My head aches so damnably
that I am incapable of thought. And this, you will admit, is a matter
NA
Captain Blood stood up. From a shelf he took a half-hour glass, reversed
it so that the bulb containing the red sand was uppermost, and stood it
on the table.
â€œI am sorry to press you in such a matter, Don Diego, but one glass is
all that I can give you. If by the time those sands have run out you can
propose no acceptable alternative, I shall most reluctantly be driven to

Captain Blood bowed, went out, and locked the door. Elbows on his knees
and face in his hands, Don Diego sat watching the rusty sands as they
filtered from the upper to the lower bulb. And what time he watched, the
lines in his lean brown face grew deeper. Punctually as the last grains
ran out, the door reopened.
The Spaniard sighed, and sat upright to face the returning Captain Blood
with the answer for which he came.
â€œI have thought of an alternative, sir captain; but it depends upon
your charity. It is that you put us ashore on one of the islands of this
NA
NA

The light-blue eyes played over him like points of steel.
NA
The Spaniard threw back his head, a frown between his eyes.
NA
â€œThen let me put it in another way--perhaps more happily: You do not
NA
â€œAh, that I can answer. I do desire to live; and even more do I desire
that my son may live. But the desire shall not make a coward of me for
NA
the least heat or resentment.
Captain Blood did not directly answer. As before he perched himself on
the corner of the table.
â€œWould you be willing, sir, to earn life and liberty--for yourself, your

NA
the quiver that ran through him. â€œTo earn it, do you say? Why, if the
NA
NA
NA
will look from those windows, Don Diego, you will see what appears to be
a cloud on the horizon. That is the island of Barbados well astern. All
day we have been sailing east before the wind with but one intent--to
set as great a distance between Barbados and ourselves as possible. But
now, almost out of sight of land, we are in a difficulty. The only man
among us schooled in the art of navigation is fevered, delirious, in
fact, as a result of certain ill-treatment he received ashore before we
carried him away with us. I can handle a ship in action, and there are
one or two men aboard who can assist me; but of the higher mysteries of
seamanship and of the art of finding a way over the trackless wastes of
ocean, we know nothing. To hug the land, and go blundering about
what you so aptly call this pestilent archipelago, is for us to court
disaster, as you can perhaps conceive. And so it comes to this: We
desire to make for the Dutch settlement of Curacao as straightly as
possible. Will you pledge me your honour, if I release you upon parole,
that you will navigate us thither? If so, we will release you and your
NA
Don Diego bowed his head upon his breast, and strode away in thought to
the stern windows. There he stood looking out upon the sunlit sea and
the dead water in the great shipâ€™s wake--his ship, which these English
dogs had wrested from him; his ship, which he was asked to bring safely
into a port where she would be completely lost to him and refitted
perhaps to make war upon his kin. That was in one scale; in the other
were the lives of sixteen men. Fourteen of them mattered little to him,
but the remaining two were his own and his sonâ€™s.
He turned at length, and his back being to the light, the Captain could
not see how pale his face had grown.
NA
CHAPTER XI. FILIAL PIETY
By virtue of the pledge he had given, Don Diego de Espinosa enjoyed the
freedom of the ship that had been his, and the navigation which he had
undertaken was left entirely in his hands. And because those who manned
her were new to the seas of the Spanish Main, and because even the
things that had happened in Bridgetown were not enough to teach them to
regard every Spaniard as a treacherous, cruel dog to be slain at sight,
they used him with the civility which his own suave urbanity invited.
He took his meals in the great cabin with Blood and the three officers
elected to support him: Hagthorpe, Wolverstone, and Dyke.
They found Don Diego an agreeable, even an amusing companion, and their
friendly feeling towards him was fostered by his fortitude and brave
equanimity in this adversity.
That Don Diego was not playing fair it was impossible to suspect.
Moreover, there was no conceivable reason why he should not. And he had
been of the utmost frankness with them. He had denounced their mistake
in sailing before the wind upon leaving Barbados. They should have left
the island to leeward, heading into the Caribbean and away from the
archipelago. As it was, they would now be forced to pass through this
archipelago again so as to make Curacao, and this passage was not to be
accomplished without some measure of risk to themselves. At any point
between the islands they might come upon an equal or superior craft;
whether she were Spanish or English would be equally bad for them, and
being undermanned they were in no case to fight. To lessen this risk
as far as possible, Don Diego directed at first a southerly and then
a westerly course; and so, taking a line midway between the islands of
Tobago and Grenada, they won safely through the danger-zone and came
into the comparative security of the Caribbean Sea.
NA
announced to them their position, â€œwe should reach Curacao inside three

For three days the wind held, indeed it freshened a little on the
second, and yet when the third night descended upon them they had still
made no landfall. The Cinco Llagas was ploughing through a sea contained
on every side by the blue bowl of heaven. Captain Blood uneasily
mentioned it to Don Diego.

â€œBy all the saints, it is always â€˜to-morrow morningâ€™ with you Spaniards;
NA
â€œBut this to-morrow is coming, rest assured. However early you may be
NA
Captain Blood passed on, content, and went to visit Jerry Pitt, his
patient, to whose condition Don Diego owed his chance of life. For
twenty-four hours now the fever had left the sufferer, and under
Peter Bloodâ€™s dressings, his lacerated back was beginning to heal
satisfactorily. So far, indeed, was he recovered that he complained of
his confinement, of the heat in his cabin. To indulge him Captain Blood
consented that he should take the air on deck, and so, as the last of
the daylight was fading from the sky, Jeremy Pitt came forth upon the
Captainâ€™s arm.
Seated on the hatch-coamings, the Somersetshire lad gratefully filled
his lungs with the cool night air, and professed himself revived
thereby. Then with the seamanâ€™s instinct his eyes wandered to the
darkling vault of heaven, spangled already with a myriad golden points
of light. Awhile he scanned it idly, vacantly; then, his attention
became sharply fixed. He looked round and up at Captain Blood, who stood
beside him.
NA
â€œAstronomy, is it? Faith, now, I couldnâ€™t tell the Belt of Orion from
NA
â€œAh! And I suppose all the others of this lubberly crew share your

NA
â€œAnd the North Star ahead almost over your starboard bow means that
weâ€™re steering a course, north, northwest, or maybe north by west, for I
NA
NA
â€œYou told me--didnâ€™t you?--that we came west of the archipelago between
Tobago and Grenada, steering for Curacao. If that were our present
NA
On the instant Mr. Blood shed his laziness. He stiffened with
apprehension, and was about to speak when a shaft of light clove the
gloom above their heads, coming from the door of the poop cabin which
had just been opened. It closed again, and presently there was a step
on the companion. Don Diego was approaching. Captain Bloodâ€™s fingers
pressed Jerryâ€™s shoulder with significance. Then he called the Don,
and spoke to him in English as had become his custom when others were
present.
NA
NA
NA
laughter lurked behind it, and the reason for this was yielded by his
NA
NA
contemptuous. â€œNow I am ready to wager him a hundred pieces of eight
NA
of light in the heavens straight abeam. He afterwards told Pitt that
had Don Diego confirmed him, he would have run him through upon that
instant. Far from that, however, the Spaniard freely expressed his
scorn.
â€œYou have the assurance that is of ignorance, Don Pedro; and you lose.
NA
NA
NA
â€œBut is it possible that I mistake? Besides, is there not the compass?
NA
His utter frankness, and the easy manner of one who has nothing to
conceal resolved at once the doubt that had leapt so suddenly in the
mind of Captain Blood. Pitt was satisfied less easily.
â€œIn that case, Don Diego, will you tell me, since Curacao is our

Again there was no faintest hesitation on Don Diegoâ€™s part. â€œYou have

neglect observation. Always it is my way. I make too sure. I count too
much on dead reckoning. And so to-day I find when at last I take out
the quadrant that we do come by a half-degree too much south, so that
Curacao is now almost due north. That is what cause the delay. But we
NA
The explanation, so completely satisfactory, and so readily and candidly
forthcoming, left no room for further doubt that Don Diego should have
been false to his parole. And when presently Don Diego had withdrawn
again, Captain Blood confessed to Pitt that it was absurd to have
suspected him. Whatever his antecedents, he had proved his quality when
he announced himself ready to die sooner than enter into any undertaking
that could hurt his honour or his country.
New to the seas of the Spanish Main and to the ways of the adventurers
who sailed it, Captain Blood still entertained illusions. But the next
dawn was to shatter them rudely and for ever.
Coming on deck before the sun was up, he saw land ahead, as the Spaniard
had promised them last night. Some ten miles ahead it lay, a long
coast-line filling the horizon east and west, with a massive headland
jutting forward straight before them. Staring at it, he frowned. He had
not conceived that Curacao was of such considerable dimensions. Indeed,
this looked less like an island than the main itself.
Beating out aweather, against the gentle landward breeze he beheld a
great ship on their starboard bow, that he conceived to be some three or
four miles off, and--as well as he could judge her at that distance--of
a tonnage equal if not superior to their own. Even as he watched her
she altered her course, and going about came heading towards them,
close-hauled.
A dozen of his fellows were astir on the forecastle, looking eagerly
ahead, and the sound of their voices and laughter reached him across the
length of the stately Cinco Llagas.
NA
NA
It was something in that voice, a muffled note of exultation, that
awoke suspicion in him, and made whole the half-doubt he had been
entertaining. He turned sharply to face Don Diego, so sharply that the
sly smile was not effaced from the Spaniardâ€™s countenance before Captain
Bloodâ€™s eyes had flashed upon it.
â€œYou find an odd satisfaction in the sight of it--all things

fell back before him with suddenly altered countenance that confirmed
his every suspicion, he flung an arm out in the direction of the distant

of knowledge seemed to dazzle and daze the Spaniard. For still Don Diego
made no answer. And then Captain Blood drew a bow at a venture--or
not quite at a venture. Such a coast-line as that, if not of the main
itself, and the main he knew it could not be, must belong to either Cuba
or Hispaniola. Now knowing Cuba to lie farther north and west of the
two, it followed, he reasoned swiftly, that if Don Diego meant betrayal
he would steer for the nearer of these Spanish territories. â€œThat land,
NA
Having said it, he closely watched the swarthy face now overspread with
pallor, to see the truth or falsehood of his guess reflected there. But
now the retreating Spaniard had come to the middle of the quarter-deck,
where the mizzen sail made a screen to shut them off from the eyes of
the Englishmen below. His lips writhed in a snarling smile.
NA
sprang for the Captainâ€™s throat.
Tight-locked in each otherâ€™s arms, they swayed a moment, then together
went down upon the deck, the Spaniardâ€™s feet jerked from under him
by the right leg of Captain Blood. The Spaniard had depended upon his
strength, which was considerable. But it proved no match for the
steady muscles of the Irishman, tempered of late by the vicissitudes
of slavery. He had depended upon choking the life out of Blood, and so
gaining the half-hour that might be necessary to bring up that fine
ship that was beating towards them--a Spanish ship, perforce, since
none other would be so boldly cruising in these Spanish waters off
Hispaniola. But all that Don Diego had accomplished was to betray
himself completely, and to no purpose. This he realized when he found
himself upon his back, pinned down by Blood, who was kneeling on his
chest, whilst the men summoned by their Captainâ€™s shout came clattering
up the companion.
â€œWill I say a prayer for your dirty soul now, whilst I am in this
NA
But the Spaniard, though defeated, now beyond hope for himself, forced
his lips to smile, and gave back mockery for mockery.
â€œWho will pray for your soul, I wonder, when that galleon comes to lie

NA
that already it was too late to avoid the consequences of Don Diegoâ€™s
betrayal of them.
NA
â€œDo you know what ship it is? I will tell you. It is the Encarnacion,
the flagship of Don Miguel de Espinosa, the Lord Admiral of Castile,
and Don Miguel is my brother. It is a very fortunate encounter. The

eyes blazed: his face was set.

The injunction was very necessary. Frenzied by the thought that they
were likely to exchange the slavery from which they had so lately
escaped for a slavery still worse, they would have torn the Spaniard
limb from limb upon the spot. And if they now obeyed their Captain
and refrained, it was only because the sudden steely note in his voice
promised for Don Diego Valdez something far more exquisite than death.
NA
apostrophized his prisoner.
But Don Diego looked up at him and laughed.

very well. I die with my work well done. In less than an hour you will

Captain Blood regarded him steadily out of a face which, if impassive,
had paled under its deep tan. About the prisoner, clamant, infuriated,
ferocious, the rebels-convict surged, almost literally â€œathirst for his

went aside to the rail. As he stood there deep in thought, he was joined
by Hagthorpe, Wolverstone, and Ogle the gunner. In silence they stared
with him across the water at that other ship. She had veered a point
away from the wind, and was running now on a line that must in the end
converge with that of the Cinco Llagas.

sarcasm, interposed a suggestion bitterly.

The Captain swung round, and for an instant looked as if he would have
struck the gunner. Then his expression changed: the light of inspiration

 And he led the way down to the waist, and thence by the booby hatch to
the gloom of the â€˜tween-decks, where the air was rank with the smell
of tar and spun yarn. Going aft he threw open the door of the spacious
wardroom, and went in followed by a dozen of the hands with the pinioned
Spaniard. Every man aboard would have followed him but for his sharp
command to some of them to remain on deck with Hagthorpe.
In the ward-room the three stern chasers were in position, loaded,
their muzzles thrusting through the open ports, precisely as the Spanish
gunners had left them.

When this was done, Blood beckoned those who held Don Diego.

NA
Don Diego, with his body stretched in an arc across the cannonâ€™s mouth,
legs and arms lashed to the carriage on either side of it, eyeballs
rolling in his head, glared maniacally at Captain Blood. A man may not
fear to die, and yet be appalled by the form in which death comes to
him.
From frothing lips he hurled blasphemies and insults at his tormentor.
â€œFoul barbarian! Inhuman savage! Accursed heretic! Will it not content
NA
a malignant smile, before he turned to meet the fifteen manacled Spanish
prisoners, who were thrust into his presence.
Approaching, they had heard Don Diegoâ€™s outcries; at close quarters now
they beheld with horror-stricken eyes his plight. From amongst them a
comely, olive-skinned stripling, distinguished in bearing and apparel
NA
Writhing in the arms that made haste to seize and hold him, he called
upon heaven and hell to avert this horror, and lastly, addressed to
Captain Blood an appeal for mercy that was at once fierce and piteous.
Considering him, Captain Blood thought with satisfaction that he
displayed the proper degree of filial piety.
He afterwards confessed that for a moment he was in danger of weakening,
that for a moment his mind rebelled against the pitiless thing it had
planned. But to correct the sentiment he evoked a memory of what these
Spaniards had performed in Bridgetown. Again he saw the white face of
that child Mary Traill as she fled in horror before the jeering ruffian
whom he had slain, and other things even more unspeakable seen on that
dreadful evening rose now before the eyes of his memory to stiffen his
faltering purpose. The Spaniards had shown themselves without mercy
or sentiment or decency of any kind; stuffed with religion, they were
without a spark of that Christianity, the Symbol of which was mounted on
the mainmast of the approaching ship. A moment ago this cruel, vicious
Don Diego had insulted the Almighty by his assumption that He kept a
specially benevolent watch over the destinies of Catholic Spain. Don
Diego should be taught his error.
Recovering the cynicism in which he had approached his task, the
cynicism essential to its proper performance, he commanded Ogle to
kindle a match and remove the leaden apron from the touch-hole of the
gun that bore Don Diego. Then, as the younger Espinosa broke into fresh
intercessions mingled with imprecations, he wheeled upon him sharply.
NA

NA
Having surprised the lad into silence by that promise--a promise
surprising enough in all the circumstances--he proceeded to explain his
aims in that faultless and elegant Castilian of which he was fortunately
master--as fortunately for Don Diego as for himself.
â€œIt is your fatherâ€™s treachery that has brought us into this plight and
deliberately into risk of capture and death aboard that ship of Spain.
Just as your father recognized his brotherâ€™s flagship, so will his
brother have recognized the Cinco Llagas. So far, then, all is well. But
presently the Encarnacion will be sufficiently close to perceive that
here all is not as it should be. Sooner or later, she must guess or
discover what is wrong, and then she will open fire or lay us board and
board. Now, we are in no case to fight, as your father knew when he ran
us into this trap. But fight we will, if we are driven to it. We make no

He laid his hand on the breech of the gun that bore Don Diego.

eyes that so steadily regarded him.

I understand? Can you avert the fight? If you know a way, and if I, or
these, can help you to it--if that is what you mean--in Heavenâ€™s name
NA
â€œA fight would be averted if Don Diego de Espinosa were to go aboard his
brotherâ€™s ship, and by his presence and assurances inform the Admiral
that all is well with the Cinco Llagas, that she is indeed still a ship
of Spain as her flag now announces. But of course Don Diego cannot go
in person, because he is... otherwise engaged. He has a slight touch of
fever--shall we say?--that detains him in his cabin. But you, his son,
may convey all this and some other matters together with his homage
to your uncle. You shall go in a boat manned by six of these Spanish
prisoners, and I--a distinguished Spaniard delivered from captivity
in Barbados by your recent raid--will accompany you to keep you in
countenance. If I return alive, and without accident of any kind to
hinder our free sailing hence, Don Diego shall have his life, as shall
every one of you. But if there is the least misadventure, be it from
treachery or ill-fortune--I care not which--the battle, as I have had
the honour to explain, will be opened on our side by this gun, and your

He paused a moment. There was a hum of approval from his comrades,
an anxious stirring among the Spanish prisoners. Young Espinosa stood
before him, the colour ebbing and flowing in his cheeks. He waited for
some direction from his father. But none came. Don Diegoâ€™s courage,
it seemed, had sadly waned under that rude test. He hung limply in his
fearful bonds, and was silent. Evidently he dared not encourage his son
to defiance, and presumably was ashamed to urge him to yield. Thus, he
left decision entirely with the youth.
NA
NA
Don Esteban moistened his parched lips, and with the back of his hand
mopped the anguish-sweat from his brow. His eyes gazed wildly a moment
upon the shoulders of his father, as if beseeching guidance. But his
father remained silent. Something like a sob escaped the boy.

Since he yielded, and their leader himself counselled no resistance,
why should they encompass their own destruction by a gesture of futile
heroism? They answered without much hesitation that they would do as was
required of them.
Blood turned, and advanced to Don Diego.
NA
he checked and frowned as his eyes intently observed the prisoner. Then,
after that scarcely perceptible pause, he continued, â€œbut I do not think
that you have anything beyond this inconvenience to apprehend, and you
NA
no answer.
Peter Blood waited a moment, observing him; then he bowed and stepped
back.
CHAPTER XII. DON PEDRO SANGRE
The Cinco Llagas and the Encarnacion, after a proper exchange of
signals, lay hove to within a quarter of a mile of each other, and
across the intervening space of gently heaving, sunlit waters sped a
boat from the former, manned by six Spanish seamen and bearing in her
stern sheets Don Esteban de Espinosa and Captain Peter Blood.
She also bore two treasure-chests containing fifty thousand pieces of
eight. Gold has at all times been considered the best of testimonies of
good faith, and Blood was determined that in all respects appearances
should be entirely on his side. His followers had accounted this
a supererogation of pretence. But Bloodâ€™s will in the matter had
prevailed. He carried further a bulky package addressed to a grande
of Spain, heavily sealed with the arms of Espinosa--another piece of
evidence hastily manufactured in the cabin of the Cinco Llagas--and he
was spending these last moments in completing his instructions to his
young companion.
Don Esteban expressed his last lingering uneasiness:
NA
â€œIt will be unfortunate for everybody. I advised your father to say a

NA
Blood nodded thoughtfully, and no more was said until they bumped
alongside the towering mass of the Encarnadon. Up the ladder went
Don Esteban closely followed by Captain Blood. In the waist stood the
Admiral himself to receive them, a handsome, self-sufficient man,
very tall and stiff, a little older and greyer than Don Diego, whom he
closely resembled. He was supported by four officers and a friar in the
black and white habit of St. Dominic.
Don Miguel opened his arms to his nephew, whose lingering panic he
mistook for pleasurable excitement, and having enfolded him to his bosom
turned to greet Don Estebanâ€™s companion.
Peter Blood bowed gracefully, entirely at his ease, so far as might be
judged from appearances.

with lowered eyes.
The Admiral and his attending officers gave him a sympathetic hearing
and a cordial welcome. Then came the dreaded question.
NA
It was young Espinosa who answered this:
â€œMy father is afflicted at denying himself that honour and pleasure. But
unfortunately, sir uncle, he is a little indisposed--oh, nothing grave;
merely sufficient to make him keep his cabin. It is a little fever, the
result of a slight wound taken in the recent raid upon Barbados, which

twinkle. â€œBut since Diego cannot come to me, why, I will go across to

For a moment Don Estebanâ€™s face was a mask of pallid fear. Then Blood
was speaking in a lowered, confidential voice that admirably blended
suavity, impressiveness, and sly mockery.
â€œIf you please, Don Miguel, but that is the very thing you must not
do--the very thing Don Diego does not wish you to do. You must not see
him until his wounds are healed. That is his own wish. That is the real
reason why he is not here. For the truth is that his wounds are not
so grave as to have prevented his coming. It was his consideration of
himself and the false position in which you would be placed if you had
direct word from him of what has happened. As your excellency has said,
there is peace between His Catholic Majesty and the King of England, and
NA
say no more. What you hear from us is no more than a mere rumour. Your

NA
Captain Blood had a momentâ€™s uneasiness. Did the Spaniard doubt his bona
fides? Yet in dress and speech he knew himself to be impeccably Spanish,
and was not Don Esteban there to confirm him? He swept on to afford
further confirmation before the Admiral could say another word.
â€œAnd we have in the boat below two chests containing fifty thousand

His excellency jumped; there was a sudden stir among his officers.
NA
NA
â€œMy brother wishes me to assume charge of this money, to carry it to
Spain for him? Well, that is a family matter between my brother and
NA
NA
NA
He gave his orders touching the embarkation of these chests, then led
the way to his regally appointed cabin, his four officers and the friar
following by particular invitation.
Seated at table there, with the tawny wine before them, and the servant
who had poured it withdrawn, Don Miguel laughed and stroked his pointed,
grizzled beard.
â€œVirgen santisima! That brother of mine has a mind that thinks of
everything. Left to myself, I might have committed a fine indiscretion
by venturing aboard his ship at such a moment. I might have seen things
NA
Both Esteban and Blood made haste to agree with him, and then Blood
raised his glass, and drank to the glory of Spain and the damnation of
the besotted James who occupied the throne of England. The latter part
of his toast was at least sincere.
The Admiral laughed.
â€œSir, sir, you need my brother here to curb your imprudences. You should
remember that His Catholic Majesty and the King of England are very good
friends. That is not a toast to propose in this cabin. But since it has
been proposed, and by one who has such particular personal cause to hate
NA
They laughed, and drank the damnation of King James--quite unofficially,
but the more fervently on that account. Then Don Esteban, uneasy on the
score of his father, and remembering that the agony of Don Diego was
being protracted with every moment that they left him in his dreadful
position, rose and announced that they must be returning.
NA
me to stay no longer than necessary to embrace you. If you will give us

NA
As they returned to the shipâ€™s side, Bloodâ€™s eyes anxiously scanned the
line of seamen leaning over the bulwarks in idle talk with the Spaniards
in the cock-boat that waited at the ladderâ€™s foot. But their manner
showed him that there was no ground for his anxiety. The boatâ€™s crew had
been wisely reticent.
The Admiral took leave of them--of Esteban affectionately, of Blood
ceremoniously.
â€œI regret to lose you so soon, Don Pedro. I wish that you could have

NA
NA
NA
They reached the boat; and she cast off from the great ship. As they
were pulling away, the Admiral waving to them from the taffrail,
they heard the shrill whistle of the boâ€™sun piping the hands to their
stations, and before they had reached the Cinco Llagas, they beheld the
Encarnacion go about under sail. She dipped her flag to them, and from
her poop a gun fired a salute.
Aboard the Cinco Llagas some one--it proved afterwards to be
Hagthorpe--had the wit to reply in the same fashion. The comedy was
ended. Yet there was something else to follow as an epilogue, a thing
that added a grim ironic flavour to the whole.
As they stepped into the waist of the Cinco Llagas, Hagthorpe advanced
to receive them. Blood observed the set, almost scared expression on his
face.

Hagthorpeâ€™s eyes looked a question. But his mind dismissed whatever
thought it held.

Noting the pause and the look, Esteban bounded forward, his face livid.

Blood looked at him gravely. Yet for all his gravity he seemed almost to

Again there came a pause, whilst conviction sank into the ladâ€™s mind.

NA
NA
NA
Captain Blood shrugged, and turned on his heel. But he did not on that
account disregard the words, nor did Hagthorpe, nor yet the others
who overheard them, as they showed at a council held that night in the
cabin.
This council was met to determine what should be done with the Spanish
prisoners. Considering that Curacao now lay beyond their reach, as
they were running short of water and provisions, and also that Pitt was
hardly yet in case to undertake the navigation of the vessel, it had
been decided that, going east of Hispaniola, and then sailing along
its northern coast, they should make for Tortuga, that haven of the
buccaneers, in which lawless port they had at least no danger of
recapture to apprehend. It was now a question whether they should convey
the Spaniards thither with them, or turn them off in a boat to make the
best of their way to the coast of Hispaniola, which was but ten miles
off. This was the course urged by Blood himself.
NA
NA
NA
NA

uncle, the Admiral, the execution of that threat will become more than

It says much for Peter Blood that the argument should have left him
unmoved. It is a little thing, perhaps, but in a narrative in which
there is so much that tells against him, I cannot--since my story is
in the nature of a brief for the defence--afford to slur a circumstance
that is so strongly in his favour, a circumstance revealing that the
cynicism attributed to him proceeded from his reason and from a brooding
over wrongs rather than from any natural instincts. â€œI care nothing for

NA

NA

exceptional. Oh, faugh! Iâ€™ve no stomach for cold-blooded killing. At
daybreak pack the Spaniards into a boat with a keg of water and a sack
NA
That was his last word on the subject, and it prevailed by virtue of the
authority they had vested in him, and of which he had taken so firm a
grip. At daybreak Don Esteban and his followers were put off in a boat.
Two days later, the Cinco Llagas sailed into the rock-bound bay of
Cayona, which Nature seemed to have designed for the stronghold of those
who had appropriated it.
CHAPTER XIII. TORTUGA
It is time fully to disclose the fact that the survival of the story of
Captain Bloodâ€™s exploits is due entirely to the industry of Jeremy Pitt,
the Somersetshire shipmaster. In addition to his ability as a navigator,
this amiable young man appears to have wielded an indefatigable pen, and
to have been inspired to indulge its fluency by the affection he very
obviously bore to Peter Blood.
He kept the log of the forty-gun frigate Arabella, on which he served as
master, or, as we should say to-day, navigating officer, as no log
that I have seen was ever kept. It runs into some twenty-odd volumes of
assorted sizes, some of which are missing altogether and others of which
are so sadly depleted of leaves as to be of little use. But if at times
in the laborious perusal of them--they are preserved in the library of
Mr. James Speke of Comerton--I have inveighed against these lacunae, at
others I have been equally troubled by the excessive prolixity of what
remains and the difficulty of disintegrating from the confused whole the
really essential parts.
I have a suspicion that Esquemeling--though how or where I can make no
surmise--must have obtained access to these records, and that he plucked
from them the brilliant feathers of several exploits to stick them into
the tail of his own hero, Captain Morgan. But that is by the way. I
mention it chiefly as a warning, for when presently I come to relate the
affair of Maracaybo, those of you who have read Esquemeling may be in
danger of supposing that Henry Morgan really performed those things
which here are veraciously attributed to Peter Blood. I think, however,
that when you come to weigh the motives actuating both Blood and the
Spanish Admiral, in that affair, and when you consider how integrally
the event is a part of Bloodâ€™s history--whilst merely a detached
incident in Morganâ€™s--you will reach my own conclusion as to which is
the real plagiarist.
The first of these logs of Pittâ€™s is taken up almost entirely with a
retrospective narrative of the events up to the time of Bloodâ€™s first
coming to Tortuga. This and the Tannatt Collection of State Trials are
the chief--though not the only--sources of my history so far.
Pitt lays great stress upon the fact that it was the circumstances upon
which I have dwelt, and these alone, that drove Peter Blood to seek
an anchorage at Tortuga. He insists at considerable length, and with a
vehemence which in itself makes it plain that an opposite opinion was
held in some quarters, that it was no part of the design of Blood or of
any of his companions in misfortune to join hands with the buccaneers
who, under a semi-official French protection, made of Tortuga a lair
whence they could sally out to drive their merciless piratical trade
chiefly at the expense of Spain.
It was, Pitt tells us, Bloodâ€™s original intention to make his way to
France or Holland. But in the long weeks of waiting for a ship to convey
him to one or the other of these countries, his resources dwindled and
finally vanished. Also, his chronicler thinks that he detected signs of
some secret trouble in his friend, and he attributes to this the abuses
of the potent West Indian spirit of which Blood became guilty in those
days of inaction, thereby sinking to the level of the wild adventurers
with whom ashore he associated.
I do not think that Pitt is guilty in this merely of special pleading,
that he is putting forward excuses for his hero. I think that in those
days there was a good deal to oppress Peter Blood. There was the thought
of Arabella Bishop--and that this thought loomed large in his mind we
are not permitted to doubt. He was maddened by the tormenting lure of
the unattainable. He desired Arabella, yet knew her beyond his reach
irrevocably and for all time. Also, whilst he may have desired to go to
France or Holland, he had no clear purpose to accomplish when he reached
one or the other of these countries. He was, when all is said, an
escaped slave, an outlaw in his own land and a homeless outcast in any
other. There remained the sea, which is free to all, and particularly
alluring to those who feel themselves at war with humanity. And so,
considering the adventurous spirit that once already had sent him
a-roving for the sheer love of it, considering that this spirit was
heightened now by a recklessness begotten of his outlawry, that his
training and skill in militant seamanship clamorously supported the
temptations that were put before him, can you wonder, or dare you blame
him, that in the end he succumbed? And remember that these temptations
proceeded not only from adventurous buccaneering acquaintances in the
taverns of that evil haven of Tortuga, but even from M. dâ€™Ogeron, the
governor of the island, who levied as his harbour dues a percentage of
one tenth of all spoils brought into the bay, and who profited further
by commissions upon money which he was desired to convert into bills of
exchange upon France.
A trade that might have worn a repellent aspect when urged by greasy,
half-drunken adventurers, boucan-hunters, lumbermen, beach-combers,
English, French, and Dutch, became a dignified, almost official form of
privateering when advocated by the courtly, middle-aged gentleman who
in representing the French West India Company seemed to represent France
herself.
Moreover, to a man--not excluding Jeremy Pitt himself, in whose blood
the call of the sea was insistent and imperative--those who had escaped
with Peter Blood from the Barbados plantations, and who, consequently,
like himself, knew not whither to turn, were all resolved upon joining
the great Brotherhood of the Coast, as those rovers called themselves.
And they united theirs to the other voices that were persuading Blood,
demanding that he should continue now in the leadership which he had
enjoyed since they had left Barbados, and swearing to follow him loyally
whithersoever he should lead them.
And so, to condense all that Jeremy has recorded in the matter, Blood
ended by yielding to external and internal pressure, abandoned himself
NA
of it.
If he resisted so long, it was, I think, the thought of Arabella Bishop
that restrained him. That they should be destined never to meet again
did not weigh at first, or, indeed, ever. He conceived the scorn with
which she would come to hear of his having turned pirate, and the scorn,
though as yet no more than imagined, hurt him as if it were already a
reality. And even when he conquered this, still the thought of her was
ever present. He compromised with the conscience that her memory kept so
disconcertingly active. He vowed that the thought of her should continue
ever before him to help him keep his hands as clean as a man might in
this desperate trade upon which he was embarking. And so, although he
might entertain no delusive hope of ever winning her for his own, of
ever even seeing her again, yet the memory of her was to abide in his
soul as a bitter-sweet, purifying influence. The love that is never to
be realized will often remain a manâ€™s guiding ideal. The resolve
being taken, he went actively to work. Ogeron, most accommodating of
governors, advanced him money for the proper equipment of his ship the
Cinco Llagas, which he renamed the Arabella. This after some little
hesitation, fearful of thus setting his heart upon his sleeve. But his
Barbados friends accounted it merely an expression of the ever-ready
irony in which their leader dealt.
To the score of followers he already possessed, he added threescore
more, picking his men with caution and discrimination--and he was an
exceptional judge of men--from amongst the adventurers of Tortuga. With
them all he entered into the articles usual among the Brethren of the
Coast under which each man was to be paid by a share in the prizes
captured. In other respects, however, the articles were different.
Aboard the Arabella there was to be none of the ruffianly indiscipline
that normally prevailed in buccaneering vessels. Those who shipped with
him undertook obedience and submission in all things to himself and
to the officers appointed by election. Any to whom this clause in the
articles was distasteful might follow some other leader.
Towards the end of December, when the hurricane season had blown itself
out, he put to sea in his well-found, well-manned ship, and before he
returned in the following May from a protracted and adventurous cruise,
the fame of Captain Peter Blood had run like ripples before the breeze
across the face of the Caribbean Sea. There was a fight in the Windward
Passage at the outset with a Spanish galleon, which had resulted in the
gutting and finally the sinking of the Spaniard. There was a daring raid
effected by means of several appropriated piraguas upon a Spanish pearl
fleet in the Rio de la Hacha, from which they had taken a particularly
rich haul of pearls. There was an overland expedition to the goldfields
of Santa Maria, on the Main, the full tale of which is hardly credible,
and there were lesser adventures through all of which the crew of the
Arabella came with credit and profit if not entirely unscathed.
And so it happened that before the Arabella came homing to Tortuga in
the following May to refit and repair--for she was not without scars, as
you conceive--the fame of her and of Peter Blood her captain had swept
from the Bahamas to the Windward Isles, from New Providence to Trinidad.
An echo of it had reached Europe, and at the Court of St. Jamesâ€™s angry
representations were made by the Ambassador of Spain, to whom it was
answered that it must not be supposed that this Captain Blood held any
commission from the King of England; that he was, in fact, a proscribed
rebel, an escaped slave, and that any measures against him by His
Catholic Majesty would receive the cordial approbation of King James II.
Don Miguel de Espinosa, the Admiral of Spain in the West Indies, and his
nephew Don Esteban who sailed with him, did not lack the will to bring
the adventurer to the yardarm. With them this business of capturing
Blood, which was now an international affair, was also a family matter.
Spain, through the mouth of Don Miguel, did not spare her threats.
The report of them reached Tortuga, and with it the assurance that Don
Miguel had behind him not only the authority of his own nation, but that
of the English King as well.
It was a brutum fulmen that inspired no terrors in Captain Blood. Nor
was he likely, on account of it, to allow himself to run to rust in the
security of Tortuga. For what he had suffered at the hands of Man he had
chosen to make Spain the scapegoat. Thus he accounted that he served a
twofold purpose: he took compensation and at the same time served, not
indeed the Stuart King, whom he despised, but England and, for that
matter, all the rest of civilized mankind which cruel, treacherous,
greedy, bigoted Castile sought to exclude from intercourse with the New
World.
One day as he sat with Hagthorpe and Wolverstone over a pipe and
a bottle of rum in the stifling reek of tar and stale tobacco of a
waterside tavern, he was accosted by a splendid ruffian in a gold-laced
coat of dark-blue satin with a crimson sash, a foot wide, about the
waist.
NA
Captain Blood looked up to consider the questioner before replying.
The man was tall and built on lines of agile strength, with a swarthy,
aquiline face that was brutally handsome. A diamond of great price
flamed on the indifferently clean hand resting on the pummel of his long
rapier, and there were gold rings in his ears, half-concealed by long
ringlets of oily chestnut hair.
Captain Blood took the pipe-stem from between his lips.
NA
NA
NA
invitation he drew up a stool and sat down at that greasy table. â€œMy
NA
NA
They had, indeed. He commanded a privateer of twenty guns that had
dropped anchor in the bay a week ago, manned by a crew mainly composed
of French boucanhunters from Northern Hispaniola, men who had good cause
to hate the Spaniard with an intensity exceeding that of the English.
Levasseur had brought them back to Tortuga from an indifferently
successful cruise. It would need more, however, than lack of success
to abate the fellowâ€™s monstrous vanity. A roaring, quarrelsome,
hard-drinking, hard-gaming scoundrel, his reputation as a buccaneer
stood high among the wild Brethren of the Coast. He enjoyed also a
reputation of another sort. There was about his gaudy, swaggering
raffishness something that the women found singularly alluring. That
he should boast openly of his bonnes fortunes did not seem strange to
Captain Blood; what he might have found strange was that there appeared
to be some measure of justification for these boasts.
It was current gossip that even Mademoiselle dâ€™Ogeron, the Governorâ€™s
daughter, had been caught in the snare of his wild attractiveness, and
that Levasseur had gone the length of audacity of asking her hand in
marriage of her father. M. dâ€™Ogeron had made him the only possible
answer. He had shown him the door. Levasseur had departed in a rage,
swearing that he would make mademoiselle his wife in the teeth of all
the fathers in Christendom, and that M. dâ€™Ogeron should bitterly rue the
affront he had put upon him.
This was the man who now thrust himself upon Captain Blood with a
proposal of association, offering him not only his sword, but his ship
and the men who sailed in her.
A dozen years ago, as a lad of barely twenty, Levasseur had sailed with
that monster of cruelty Lâ€™Ollonais, and his own subsequent exploits
bore witness and did credit to the school in which he had been reared. I
doubt if in his day there was a greater scoundrel among the Brethren of
the Coast than this Levasseur. And yet, repulsive though he found him,
Captain Blood could not deny that the fellowâ€™s proposals displayed
boldness, imagination, and resource, and he was forced to admit that
jointly they could undertake operations of a greater magnitude than was
possible singly to either of them. The climax of Levasseurâ€™s project was
to be a raid upon the wealthy mainland city of Maracaybo; but for this,
he admitted, six hundred men at the very least would be required, and
six hundred men were not to be conveyed in the two bottoms they now
commanded. Preliminary cruises must take place, having for one of their
objects the capture of further ships.
Because he disliked the man, Captain Blood would not commit himself at
once. But because he liked the proposal he consented to consider it.
Being afterwards pressed by both Hagthorpe and Wolverstone, who did not
share his own personal dislike of the Frenchman, the end of the matter
was that within a week articles were drawn up between Levasseur
and Blood, and signed by them and--as was usual--by the chosen
representatives of their followers.
These articles contained, inter alia, the common provisions that, should
the two vessels separate, a strict account must afterwards be rendered
of all prizes severally taken, whilst the vessel taking a prize should
retain three fifths of its value, surrendering two fifths to its
associate. These shares were subsequently to be subdivided among the
crew of each vessel, in accordance with the articles already obtaining
between each captain and his own men. For the rest, the articles
contained all the clauses that were usual, among which was the clause
that any man found guilty of abstracting or concealing any part of a
prize, be it of the value of no more than a peso, should be summarily
hanged from the yardarm.
All being now settled they made ready for sea, and on the very eve of
sailing, Levasseur narrowly escaped being shot in a romantic attempt
to scale the wall of the Governorâ€™s garden, with the object of taking
passionate leave of the infatuated Mademoiselle dâ€™Ogeron. He desisted
after having been twice fired upon from a fragrant ambush of pimento
trees where the Governorâ€™s guards were posted, and he departed vowing to
take different and very definite measures on his return.
That night he slept on board his ship, which with characteristic
flamboyance he had named La Foudre, and there on the following day he
received a visit from Captain Blood, whom he greeted half-mockingly as
his admiral. The Irishman came to settle certain final details of which
all that need concern us is an understanding that, in the event of the
two vessels becoming separated by accident or design, they should rejoin
each other as soon as might be at Tortuga.
Thereafter Levasseur entertained his admiral to dinner, and jointly they
drank success to the expedition, so copiously on the part of Levasseur
that when the time came to separate he was as nearly drunk as it seemed
possible for him to be and yet retain his understanding.
Finally, towards evening, Captain Blood went over the side and was rowed
back to his great ship with her red bulwarks and gilded ports, touched
into a lovely thing of flame by the setting sun.
He was a little heavy-hearted. I have said that he was a judge of men,
and his judgment of Levasseur filled him with misgivings which were
growing heavier in a measure as the hour of departure approached.
He expressed it to Wolverstone, who met him as he stepped aboard the
Arabella:
â€œYou over persuaded me into those articles, you blackguard; and itâ€™ll

The giant rolled his single bloodthirsty eye, and sneered, thrusting out

CHAPTER XIV. LEVASSEURâ€™S HEROICS
It would be somewhere about ten oâ€™clock on the following morning, a
full hour before the time appointed for sailing, when a canoe brought up
alongside La Foudre, and a half-caste Indian stepped out of her and went
up the ladder. He was clad in drawers of hairy, untanned hide, and a red
blanket served him for a cloak. He was the bearer of a folded scrap of
paper for Captain Levasseur.
The Captain unfolded the letter, sadly soiled and crumpled by contact
with the half-casteâ€™s person. Its contents may be roughly translated
thus:
â€œMy well-beloved--I am in the Dutch brig Jongvrow, which is about to
sail. Resolved to separate us for ever, my cruel father is sending me to
Europe in my brotherâ€™s charge. I implore you, come to my rescue. Deliver
NA
The well-beloved hero was moved to the soul of him by that passionate
appeal. His scowling glance swept the bay for the Dutch brig, which
he knew had been due to sail for Amsterdam with a cargo of hides and
tobacco.
She was nowhere to be seen among the shipping in that narrow, rock-bound
harbour. He roared out the question in his mind.
In answer the half-caste pointed out beyond the frothing surf that
marked the position of the reef constituting one of the strongholdâ€™s
main defences. Away beyond it, a mile or so distant, a sail was standing

â€œAnd where have you been that you come here only now with this? Answer
NA
The half-caste shrank terrified before his fury. His explanation, if he
had one, was paralyzed by fear. Levasseur took him by the throat, shook
him twice, snarling the while, then hurled him into the scuppers. The
manâ€™s head struck the gunwale as he fell, and he lay there, quite still,
a trickle of blood issuing from his mouth.
Levasseur dashed one hand against the other, as if dusting them.

NA
distant sail, were gloomily thoughtful. Not for long. The imagination
and resource which Captain Blood had detected in the fellow soon
suggested a course.
Cursing in his soul, and even before the anchor was weighed, the
association into which he had entered, he was already studying ways
of evasion. What Cahusac implied was true: Blood would never suffer
violence to be done in his presence to a Dutchman; but it might be done
in his absence; and, being done, Blood must perforce condone it, since
it would then be too late to protest.
Within the hour the Arabella and La Foudre were beating out to sea
together. Without understanding the change of plan involved, Captain
Blood, nevertheless, accepted it, and weighed anchor before the
appointed time upon perceiving his associate to do so.
All day the Dutch brig was in sight, though by evening she had dwindled
to the merest speck on the northern horizon. The course prescribed
for Blood and Levasseur lay eastward along the northern shores of
Hispaniola. To that course the Arabella continued to hold steadily
throughout the night. When day broke again, she was alone. La Foudre
under cover of the darkness had struck away to The northeast with every
rag of canvas on her yards.
Cahusac had attempted yet again to protest against this.
NA
she Dutch or Spanish, and ships are our present need. That will suffice
NA
His lieutenant said no more. But from his glimpse of the letter, knowing
that a girl and not a ship was his captainâ€™s real objective, he gloomily
shook his head as he rolled away on his bowed legs to give the necessary
orders.
Dawn found La Foudre close on the Dutchmanâ€™s heels, not a mile astern,
and the sight of her very evidently flustered the Jongvrow. No doubt
mademoiselleâ€™s brother recognizing Levasseurâ€™s ship would be responsible
for the Dutch uneasiness. They saw the Jongvrow crowding canvas in a
futile endeavour to outsail them, whereupon they stood off to starboard
and raced on until they were in a position whence they could send
a warning shot across her bow. The Jongvrow veered, showed them her
rudder, and opened fire with her stern chasers. The small shot went
whistling through La Foudreâ€™s shrouds with some slight damage to her
canvas. Followed a brief running fight in the course of which the
Dutchman let fly a broadside.
Five minutes after that they were board and board, the Jongvrow held
tight in the clutches of La Foudreâ€™s grapnels, and the buccaneers
pouring noisily into her waist.
The Dutchmanâ€™s master, purple in the face, stood forward to beard the
pirate, followed closely by an elegant, pale-faced young gentleman in
whom Levasseur recognized his brother-in-law elect.
â€œCaptain Levasseur, this is an outrage for which you shall be made to

â€œAt first I sought only that which belongs to me, something of which I
am being robbed. But since you chose war and opened fire on me with some
damage to my ship and loss of life to five of my men, why, war it is,

From the quarter rail Mademoiselle dâ€™Ogeron looked down with glowing
eyes in breathless wonder upon her well-beloved hero. Gloriously heroic
he seemed as he stood towering there, masterful, audacious, beautiful.
He saw her, and with a glad shout sprang towards her. The Dutch master
got in his way with hands upheld to arrest his progress. Levasseur did
not stay to argue with him: he was too impatient to reach his mistress.
He swung the poleaxe that he carried, and the Dutchman went down in
blood with a cloven skull. The eager lover stepped across the body and
came on, his countenance joyously alight.
But mademoiselle was shrinking now, in horror. She was a girl upon the
threshold of glorious womanhood, of a fine height and nobly moulded,
with heavy coils of glossy black hair above and about a face that was of
the colour of old ivory. Her countenance was cast in lines of arrogance,
stressed by the low lids of her full dark eyes.
In a bound her well-beloved was beside her, flinging away his bloody
poleaxe, he opened wide his arms to enfold her. But she still shrank
even within his embrace, which would not be denied; a look of dread had
come to temper the normal arrogance of her almost perfect face.
NA
theatrically, truly heroic.
But she, endeavouring to thrust him back, her hands against his breast,

He laughed, as a hero should; and answered her heroically, with the
tolerance of a god for the mortal to whom he condescends: â€œHe stood

It was so splendidly terrific, the gesture of it was so broad and fine
and his magnetism so compelling, that she cast her silly tremors and
yielded herself freely, intoxicated, to his fond embrace. Thereafter he
swung her to his shoulder, and stepping with ease beneath that burden,
bore her in a sort of triumph, lustily cheered by his men, to the
deck of his own ship. Her inconsiderate brother might have ruined that
romantic scene but for the watchful Cahusac, who quietly tripped him up,
and then trussed him like a fowl.
Thereafter, what time the Captain languished in his ladyâ€™s smile within
the cabin, Cahusac was dealing with the spoils of war. The Dutch crew
was ordered into the longboat, and bidden go to the devil. Fortunately,
as they numbered fewer than thirty, the longboat, though perilously
overcrowded, could yet contain them. Next, Cahusac having inspected the
cargo, put a quartermaster and a score of men aboard the Jongvrow, and
left her to follow La Foudre, which he now headed south for the Leeward
Islands.
Cahusac was disposed to be ill-humoured. The risk they had run in
taking the Dutch brig and doing violence to members of the family of
the Governor of Tortuga, was out of all proportion to the value of their
prize. He said so, sullenly, to Levasseur.
NA

I am going to take it out again. I shall send an offer of terms to the
Governor of Tortuga that he will be forced to accept. Set a course for

Levasseur went back to the adoring lady.
Thither, too, the ladyâ€™s brother was presently conducted. The Captain
rose to receive him, bending his stalwart height to avoid striking the
cabin roof with his head. Mademoiselle rose too.

He might have said more but that Levasseur struck him across the mouth.
Levasseur, you see, cared as little as another to hear the truth about
himself.
Mademoiselle suppressed a scream, as the youth staggered back under the
blow. He came to rest against a bulkhead, and leaned there with bleeding
lips. But his spirit was unquenched, and there was a ghastly smile on
his white face as his eyes sought his sisterâ€™s.

The simple words, and, more than the words, their tone of ineffable
disdain, aroused the passion that never slumbered deeply in Levasseur.

intuitions made her conscious.
With blanched cheeks she stood by the cabin table, and cried out to
Levasseur to stop. To obey her, he opened the door, and flung her
brother through it.
NA
and shut the door.
Composing himself, he turned to the girl again with a deprecatory smile.
But no smile answered him from her set face. She had seen her beloved
heroâ€™s nature in curl-papers, as it were, and she found the spectacle
disgusting and terrifying. It recalled the brutal slaughter of the Dutch
captain, and suddenly she realized that what her brother had just said
of this man was no more than true. Fear growing to panic was written on
her face, as she stood there leaning for support against the table.
NA
recoiled before him. There was a smile on his face, a glitter in his
eyes that fetched her heart into her throat.
He caught her, as she reached the uttermost limits of the cabin, seized
her in his long arms and pulled her to him.

NA
of all. He crushed her to him brutally, deliberately hurtful because she
resisted, and kissed her whilst she writhed in his embrace. Then, his
passion mounting, he grew angry and stripped off the last rag of heroâ€™s
mask that still may have hung upon his face. â€œLittle fool, did you
not hear your brother say that you are in my power? Remember it, and
remember that of your own free will you came. I am not the man with whom
a woman can play fast and loose. So get sense, my girl, and accept what
NA
NA
Some one knocked. Cursing the interruption, Levasseur strode off to
open. Cahusac stood before him. The Bretonâ€™s face was grave. He came
to report that they had sprung a leak between wind and water, the
consequence of damage sustained from one of the Dutchmanâ€™s shots. In
alarm Levasseur went off with him. The leakage was not serious so long
as the weather kept fine; but should a storm overtake them it might
speedily become so. A man was slung overboard to make a partial stoppage
with a sail-cloth, and the pumps were got to work.
Ahead of them a low cloud showed on the horizon, which Cahusac
pronounced one of the northernmost of the Virgin Islands.

For the remainder of that day Levasseurâ€™s thoughts were of anything but
love. He remained on deck, his eyes now upon the land, now upon those
two slowly gaining ships. To run for the open could avail him nothing,
and in his leaky condition would provide an additional danger. He must
stand at bay and fight. And then, towards evening, when within three
miles of shore and when he was about to give the order to strip
for battle, he almost fainted from relief to hear a voice from the
crowâ€™s-nest above announce that the larger of the two ships was the
Arabella. Her companion was presumably a prize.
But the pessimism of Cahusac abated nothing.

Presently the four vessels lay to off the northern coast of La Virgen
Magra, a narrow little island arid and treeless, some twelve miles
by three, uninhabited save by birds and turtles and unproductive of
anything but salt, of which there were considerable ponds to the south.
Levasseur put off in a boat accompanied by Cahusac and two other
officers, and went to visit Captain Blood aboard the Arabella.
NA
NA
good-humour as he led the way to the great cabin for a rendering of
accounts.
The tall ship that accompanied the Arabella was a Spanish vessel of
twenty-six guns, the Santiago from Puerto Rico with a hundred and twenty
thousand weight of cacao, forty thousand pieces of eight, and the value
of ten thousand more in jewels. A rich capture of which two fifths under
the articles went to Levasseur and his crew. Of the money and jewels a
division was made on the spot. The cacao it was agreed should be taken
to Tortuga to be sold.
Then it was the turn of Levasseur, and black grew the brow of Captain
Blood as the Frenchmanâ€™s tale was unfolded. At the end he roundly
expressed his disapproval. The Dutch were a friendly people whom it was
a folly to alienate, particularly for so paltry a matter as these hides
and tobacco, which at most would fetch a bare twenty thousand pieces.
But Levasseur answered him, as he had answered Cahusac, that a ship was
a ship, and it was ships they needed against their projected enterprise.
Perhaps because things had gone well with him that day, Blood ended
by shrugging the matter aside. Thereupon Levasseur proposed that the
Arabella and her prize should return to Tortuga there to unload the
cacao and enlist the further adventurers that could now be shipped.
Levasseur meanwhile would effect certain necessary repairs, and
then proceeding south, await his admiral at Saltatudos, an island
conveniently situated--in the latitude of 11 deg. 11â€™ N.--for their
enterprise against Maracaybo.
To Levasseurâ€™s relief, Captain Blood not only agreed, but pronounced
himself ready to set sail at once.
No sooner had the Arabella departed than Levasseur brought his ships
into the lagoon, and set his crew to work upon the erection of temporary
quarters ashore for himself, his men, and his enforced guests during the
careening and repairing of La Foudre.
At sunset that evening the wind freshened; it grew to a gale, and from
that to such a hurricane that Levasseur was thankful to find himself
ashore and his ships in safe shelter. He wondered a little how it might
be faring with Captain Blood out there at the mercy of that terrific
storm; but he did not permit concern to trouble him unduly.
CHAPTER XV. THE RANSOM
In the glory of the following morning, sparkling and clear after the
storm, with an invigorating, briny tang in the air from the salt-ponds
on the south of the island, a curious scene was played on the beach of
the Virgen Magra, at the foot of a ridge of bleached dunes, beside the
spread of sail from which Levasseur had improvised a tent.
Enthroned upon an empty cask sat the French filibuster to transact
important business: the business of making himself safe with the
Governor of Tortuga.
A guard of honour of a half-dozen officers hung about him; five of them
were rude boucan-hunters, in stained jerkins and leather breeches; the
sixth was Cahusac. Before him, guarded by two half-naked negroes, stood
young dâ€™Ogeron, in frilled shirt and satin small-clothes and fine shoes
of Cordovan leather. He was stripped of doublet, and his hands were tied
behind him. The young gentlemanâ€™s comely face was haggard. Near at
hand, and also under guard, but unpinioned, mademoiselle his sister sat
hunched upon a hillock of sand. She was very pale, and it was in vain
that she sought to veil in a mask of arrogance the fears by which she
was assailed.
Levasseur addressed himself to M. dâ€™Ogeron. He spoke at long length. In
the end--
NA
myself quite clear. So that there may be no misunderstandings, I will
recapitulate. Your ransom is fixed at twenty thousand pieces of eight,
and you shall have liberty on parole to go to Tortuga to collect it.
In fact, I shall provide the means to convey you thither, and you shall
have a month in which to come and go. Meanwhile, your sister remains
with me as a hostage. Your father should not consider such a sum
excessive as the price of his sonâ€™s liberty and to provide a dowry for
his daughter. Indeed, if anything, I am too modest, pardi! M. dâ€™Ogeron
NA
M. dâ€™Ogeron the younger raised his head and looked the Captain boldly in
the face.
â€œI refuse--utterly and absolutely, do you understand? So do your worst,
NA
NA
You have not considered the alternative. When you do, you will not
persist in your refusal. You will not do that in any case. We have spurs
for the reluctant. And I warn you against giving me your parole under
stress, and afterwards playing me false. I shall know how to find and
punish you. Meanwhile, remember your sisterâ€™s honour is in pawn to me.
Should you forget to return with the dowry, you will not consider it
NA
Levasseurâ€™s smiling eyes, intent upon the young manâ€™s face, saw the
horror that crept into his glance. M. dâ€™Ogeron cast a wild glance at
mademoiselle, and observed the grey despair that had almost stamped the
beauty from her face. Disgust and fury swept across his countenance.
Then he braced himself and answered resolutely:
NA
NA
coldly mocking regret. His fingers had been busy tying knots in a length
of whipcord. He held it up. â€œYou know this? It is a rosary of pain that
has wrought the conversion of many a stubborn heretic. It is capable
of screwing the eyes out of a manâ€™s head by way of helping him to see
NA
He flung the length of knotted cord to one of the negroes, who in an
instant made it fast about the prisonerâ€™s brows. Then between cord and
cranium the black inserted a short length of metal, round and slender
as a pipe-stem. That done he rolled his eyes towards Levasseur, awaiting
the Captainâ€™s signal.
Levasseur considered his victim, and beheld him tense and braced, his
haggard face of a leaden hue, beads of perspiration glinting on his
pallid brow just beneath the whipcord.
Mademoiselle cried out, and would have risen: but her guards restrained
her, and she sank down again, moaning.
NA
â€œby being reasonable. What, after all, is the sum I have named? To your
wealthy father a bagatelle. I repeat, I have been too modest. But since
I have said twenty thousand pieces of eight, twenty thousand pieces it

â€œAnd for what, if you please, have you said twenty thousand pieces of
NA
In execrable French, but in a voice that was crisp and pleasant, seeming
to echo some of the mockery that had invested Levasseurâ€™s, that question
floated over their heads.
Startled, Levasseur and his officers looked up and round. On the crest
of the dunes behind them, in sharp silhouette against the deep cobalt of
the sky, they beheld a tall, lean figure scrupulously dressed in black
with silver lace, a crimson ostrich plume curled about the broad brim of
his hat affording the only touch of colour. Under that hat was the tawny
face of Captain Blood.
Levasseur gathered himself up with an oath of amazement. He had
conceived Captain Blood by now well below the horizon, on his way to
Tortuga, assuming him to have been so fortunate as to have weathered
last nightâ€™s storm.
Launching himself upon the yielding sand, into which he sank to the
level of the calves of his fine boots of Spanish leather, Captain Blood
came sliding erect to the beach. He was followed by Wolverstone, and
a dozen others. As he came to a standstill, he doffed his hat, with a
flourish, to the lady. Then he turned to Levasseur.

of the island a couple of miles away, and weâ€™ve walked across to

Cahusac shrugged his shoulders, and tossed his long arms to heaven.

Levasseur gnawed his lip, and changed colour. But he controlled himself
to answer civilly:

NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI did not. They are prisoners of my own--a personal matter. They are
NA
NA
prisoners.
M. dâ€™Ogeron stood tense and braced as before, but the grey horror had
left his face. Hope had leapt within him at this interruption, obviously
as little expected by his tormentor as by himself. His sister, moved
by a similar intuition, was leaning forward with parted lips and gaping
eyes.
Captain Blood fingered his lip, and frowned thoughtfully upon Levasseur.
â€œYesterday you surprised me by making war upon the friendly Dutch. But

NA

Captain Bloodâ€™s crisp, authoritative, faintly disdainful manner stirred
Levasseurâ€™s quick anger. The blood crept slowly back into his blenched
face, and his glance grew in insolence, almost in menace. Meanwhile the
prisoner answered for him.

NA
NA
NA
Levasseur swung aside with an imprecation. In Captain Blood, amazement
for the moment quenched every other emotion.
â€œThe saints preserve us now! Are you quite mad, Levasseur? First you
molest the Dutch, who are our friends; next you take prisoners two
persons that are French, your own countrymen; and now, faith, theyâ€™re no
less than the children of the Governor of Tortuga, which is the one safe

Levasseur broke in angrily:

that Levasseur had lately occupied, and looked up blandly. â€œI may inform
you, to save time, that I heard the entire proposal that you made to
this lady and this gentleman, and Iâ€™ll also remind you that we sail
under articles that admit no ambiguities. You have fixed their ransom at
twenty thousand pieces of eight. That sum then belongs to your crews and
mine in the proportions by the articles established. Youâ€™ll hardly wish
to dispute it. But what is far more grave is that you have concealed
from me this part of the prizes taken on your last cruise, and for
such an offence as that the articles provide certain penalties that are

prisoners, and of provoking the anger of the Governor of Tortuga. Iâ€™ll
accept the situation as I find it. Yourself youâ€™ve fixed the ransom of
this couple at twenty thousand pieces, and, as I gather, the lady is
to be your perquisite. But why should she be your perquisite more than
anotherâ€™s, seeing that she belongs by the articles to all of us, as a

Black as thunder grew the brow of Levasseur.

Levasseur contained his rage, that he might reason with the Irishman.
â€œThat is the ransom of the man. It is to be paid for him by the Governor
NA
â€œNo, no. Yeâ€™ve parcelled the twain together--very oddly, I confess.
Yeâ€™ve set their value at twenty thousand pieces, and for that sum you
may have them, since you desire it; but youâ€™ll pay for them the twenty
thousand pieces that are ultimately to come to you as the ransom of
one and the dowry of the other; and that sum shall be divided among our
crews. So that you do that, it is conceivable that our followers may

To Levasseur the jest lay in that Captain Blood, with no more than a
dozen followers, should come there attempting to hector him who had a
hundred men within easy call. But it seemed that he had left out of his
reckoning something which his opponent had counted in. For as, laughing
still, Levasseur swung to his officers, he saw that which choked the
laughter in his throat. Captain Blood had shrewdly played upon the
cupidity that was the paramount inspiration of those adventurers. And
Levasseur now read clearly on their faces how completely they adopted
Captain Bloodâ€™s suggestion that all must participate in the ransom which
their leader had thought to appropriate to himself.
It gave the gaudy ruffian pause, and whilst in his heart he cursed
those followers of his, who could be faithful only to their greed, he
perceived--and only just in time--that he had best tread warily.

rolled into his left palm four or five pearls each of the size of a

The Breton took between coarse finger and thumb the proffered lustrous,

But it was one of Levasseurâ€™s own officers who hindered him.
â€œNom de Dieu, my Captain! What will you do? It is settled; honourably

NA
Cahusac, with the pearls clutched in his capacious hand, stepped up to
him on the other side. â€œDonâ€™t be a fool, Captain. Do you want to provoke
trouble between the crews? His men outnumber us by nearly two to one.
Whatâ€™s a girl more or less? In Heavenâ€™s name, let her go. Heâ€™s paid

NA
foul vocabulary he could find no epithet to describe his lieutenant.
He caught him a blow that almost sent him sprawling. The pearls were
scattered in the sand.
Cahusac dived after them, his fellows with him. Vengeance must wait.
For some moments they groped there on hands and knees, oblivious of all
else. And yet in those moments vital things were happening.
Levasseur, his hand on his sword, his face a white mask of rage, was
confronting Captain Blood to hinder his departure.
NA
NA
blade flashed in the sunlight. â€œThe articles provide that any man of
whatever rank concealing any part of a prize, be it of the value of no
more than a peso, shall be hanged at the yardarm. Itâ€™s what I intended
for you in the end. But since ye prefer it this way, ye muckrake, faith,
NA
He waved away the men who would have interfered, and the blades rang
together.
M. dâ€™Ogeron looked on, a man bemused, unable to surmise what the issue
either way could mean for him. Meanwhile, two of Bloodâ€™s men who had
taken the place of the Frenchmanâ€™s negro guards, had removed the crown
of whipcord from his brow. As for mademoiselle, she had risen, and was
leaning forward, a hand pressed tightly to her heaving breast, her face
deathly pale, a wild terror in her eyes.
It was soon over. The brute strength, upon which Levasseur so
confidently counted, could avail nothing against the Irishmanâ€™s
practised skill. When, with both lungs transfixed, he lay prone on the
white sand, coughing out his rascally life, Captain Blood looked calmly
at Cahusac across the body.
NA
cynical eyes Cahusac considered the twitching body of his recent leader.
Had Levasseur been a man of different temper, the affair might have
ended in a very different manner. But, then, it is certain that Captain
Blood would have adopted in dealing with him different tactics. As it
was, Levasseur commanded neither love nor loyalty. The men who followed
him were the very dregs of that vile trade, and cupidity was their only
inspiration. Upon that cupidity Captain Blood had deftly played, until
he had brought them to find Levasseur guilty of the one offence they
deemed unpardonable, the crime of appropriating to himself something
which might be converted into gold and shared amongst them all.
Thus now the threatening mob of buccaneers that came hastening to the
theatre of that swift tragi-comedy were appeased by a dozen words of
Cahusacâ€™s.
Whilst still they hesitated, Blood added something to quicken their
decision.
â€œIf you will come to our anchorage, you shall receive at once your share
NA
They crossed the island, the two prisoners accompanying them, and later
that day, the division made, they would have parted company but that
Cahusac, at the instances of the men who had elected him Levasseurâ€™s
successor, offered Captain Blood anew the services of that French
contingent.
NA
so on the condition that you make your peace with the Dutch, and restore
NA
The condition was accepted, and Captain Blood went off to find his
guests, the children of the Governor of Tortuga.
Mademoiselle dâ€™Ogeron and her brother--the latter now relieved of his
bonds--sat in the great cabin of the Arabella, whither they had been
conducted.
Wine and food had been placed upon the table by Benjamin, Captain
Bloodâ€™s negro steward and cook, who had intimated to them that it was
for their entertainment. But it had remained untouched. Brother and
sister sat there in agonized bewilderment, conceiving that their escape
was but from frying-pan to fire. At length, overwrought by the suspense,
mademoiselle flung herself upon her knees before her brother to implore
his pardon for all the evil brought upon them by her wicked folly.
M. dâ€™Ogeron was not in a forgiving mood.
â€œI am glad that at least you realize what you have done. And now this
other filibuster has bought you, and you belong to him. You realize
NA
He might have said more, but he checked upon perceiving that the door
was opening. Captain Blood, coming from settling matters with the
followers of Levasseur, stood on the threshold. M. dâ€™Ogeron had not
troubled to restrain his high-pitched voice, and the Captain had
overheard the Frenchmanâ€™s last two sentences. Therefore he perfectly
understood why mademoiselle should bound up at sight of him, and shrink
back in fear.
NA
dismiss your fears. Aboard this ship you shall be treated with all
honour. So soon as we are in case to put to sea again, we steer a course
for Tortuga to take you home to your father. And pray do not consider
that I have bought you, as your brother has just said. All that I
have done has been to provide the ransom necessary to bribe a gang of
scoundrels to depart from obedience to the arch-scoundrel who commanded
them, and so deliver you from all peril. Count it, if you please, a

Mademoiselle stared at him in unbelief. M. dâ€™Ogeron rose to his feet.

are not the ways of Levasseur, who should have stayed in Europe, and
practised purse-cutting. I have a sort of honour--shall we say, some

he added: â€œWe dine in an hour, and I trust that you will honour my table
with your company. Meanwhile, Benjamin will see, monsieur, that you are

He bowed to them, and turned to depart again, but mademoiselle detained
him.

He checked and turned, whilst slowly she approached him, regarding him
between dread and wonder.

But she would not be restrained. Her surcharged heart must overflow in
confidence.
â€œMonsieur, for what befell I am greatly at fault. This man--this

Abruptly she fell on her knees, caught his hand and kissed it before he
could wrench it from her.

â€œAn amende. In my mind I dishonoured you by deeming you his like, by

Captain Blood looked down upon her, and a smile broke on his lips,
irradiating the blue eyes that looked so oddly light in that tawny face.
NA
NA
As he handed her to her feet again, he assured himself that he had
behaved rather well in the affair. Then he sighed. That dubious fame of
his that had spread so quickly across the Caribbean would by now have
reached the ears of Arabella Bishop. That she would despise him, he
could not doubt, deeming him no better than all the other scoundrels who
drove this villainous buccaneering trade. Therefore he hoped that some
echo of this deed might reach her also, and be set by her against
some of that contempt. For the whole truth, which he withheld from
Mademoiselle dâ€™Ogeron, was that in venturing his life to save her, he
had been driven by the thought that the deed must be pleasing in the
eyes of Miss Bishop could she but witness it.
CHAPTER XVI. THE TRAP
That affair of Mademoiselle dâ€™Ogeron bore as its natural fruit an
improvement in the already cordial relations between Captain Blood
and the Governor of Tortuga. At the fine stone house, with its
green-jalousied windows, which M. dâ€™Ogeron had built himself in a
spacious and luxuriant garden to the east of Cayona, the Captain became
a very welcome guest. M. dâ€™Ogeron was in the Captainâ€™s debt for more
than the twenty thousand pieces of eight which he had provided for
mademoiselleâ€™s ransom; and shrewd, hard bargain-driver though he might
be, the Frenchman could be generous and understood the sentiment of
gratitude. This he now proved in every possible way, and under his
powerful protection the credit of Captain Blood among the buccaneers
very rapidly reached its zenith.
So when it came to fitting out his fleet for that enterprise against
Maracaybo, which had originally been Levasseurâ€™s project, he did not
want for either ships or men to follow him. He recruited five hundred
adventurers in all, and he might have had as many thousands if he could
have offered them accommodation. Similarly without difficulty he might
have increased his fleet to twice its strength of ships but that he
preferred to keep it what it was. The three vessels to which he confined
it were the Arabella, the La Foudre, which Cahusac now commanded with a
contingent of some sixscore Frenchmen, and the Santiago, which had been
refitted and rechristened the Elizabeth, after that Queen of England
whose seamen had humbled Spain as Captain Blood now hoped to humble it
again. Hagthorpe, in virtue of his service in the navy, was appointed by
Blood to command her, and the appointment was confirmed by the men.
It was some months after the rescue of Mademoiselle dâ€™Ogeron--in August
of that year 1687--that this little fleet, after some minor adventures
which I pass over in silence, sailed into the great lake of Maracaybo
and effected its raid upon that opulent city of the Main.
The affair did not proceed exactly as was hoped, and Bloodâ€™s force came
to find itself in a precarious position. This is best explained in the
words employed by Cahusac--which Pitt has carefully recorded--in the
course of an altercation that broke out on the steps of the Church
of Nuestra Senora del Carmen, which Captain Blood had impiously
appropriated for the purpose of a corps-de-garde. I have said already
that he was a papist only when it suited him.
The dispute was being conducted by Hagthorpe, Wolverstone, and Pitt on
the one side, and Cahusac, out of whose uneasiness it all arose, on the
other. Behind them in the sun-scorched, dusty square, sparsely fringed
by palms, whose fronds drooped listlessly in the quivering heat, surged
a couple of hundred wild fellows belonging to both parties, their own
excitement momentarily quelled so that they might listen to what passed
among their leaders.
Cahusac appeared to be having it all his own way, and he raised
his harsh, querulous voice so that all might hear his truculent
denunciation. He spoke, Pitt tells us, a dreadful kind of English, which
the shipmaster, however, makes little attempt to reproduce. His dress
was as discordant as his speech. It was of a kind to advertise his
trade, and ludicrously in contrast with the sober garb of Hagthorpe
and the almost foppish daintiness of Jeremy Pitt. His soiled and
blood-stained shirt of blue cotton was open in front, to cool his hairy
breast, and the girdle about the waist of his leather breeches carried
an arsenal of pistols and a knife, whilst a cutlass hung from a leather
baldrick loosely slung about his body; above his countenance, broad and
flat as a Mongolianâ€™s, a red scarf was swathed, turban-wise, about his
head.
â€œIs it that I have not warned you from the beginning that all was too
NA
friends. I have eyes, me. And I see. I see an abandoned fort at the
entrance of the lake, and nobody there to fire a gun at us when we came
in. Then I suspect the trap. Who would not that had eyes and brain? Bah!
we come on. What do we find? A city, abandoned like the fort; a city out
of which the people have taken all things of value. Again I warn Captain
Blood. It is a trap, I say. We are to come on; always to come on,
without opposition, until we find that it is too late to go to sea
again, that we cannot go back at all. But no one will listen to me. You
all know so much more. Name of God! Captain Blood, he will go on, and we
go on. We go to Gibraltar. True that at last, after long time, we catch
the Deputy-Governor; true, we make him pay big ransom for Gibraltar;
true between that ransom and the loot we return here with some two
thousand pieces of eight. But what is it, in reality, will you tell me?
Or shall I tell you? It is a piece of cheese--a piece of cheese in a
mousetrap, and we are the little mice. Goddam! And the cats--oh, the
cats they wait for us! The cats are those four Spanish ships of war that
have come meantime. And they wait for us outside the bottle-neck of this
lagoon. Mort de Dieu! That is what comes of the damned obstinacy of your
NA
Wolverstone laughed. Cahusac exploded in fury.
â€œAh, sangdieu! Tu ris, animal? You laugh! Tell me this: How do we get
NA
From the buccaneers at the foot of the steps came an angry rumble of
approval. The single eye of the gigantic Wolverstone rolled terribly,
and he clenched his great fists as if to strike the Frenchman, who was
exposing them to mutiny. But Cahusac was not daunted. The mood of the
men enheartened him.
â€œYou think, perhaps, this your Captain Blood is the good God. That he
can make miracles, eh? He is ridiculous, you know, this Captain Blood;
NA
He checked. Out of the church at that moment, grand air and all,
sauntered Peter Blood. With him came a tough, long-legged French
sea-wolf named Yberville, who, though still young, had already won fame
as a privateer commander before the loss of his own ship had driven him
to take service under Blood. The Captain advanced towards that disputing
group, leaning lightly upon his long ebony cane, his face shaded by a
broad-plumed hat. There was in his appearance nothing of the buccaneer.
He had much more the air of a lounger in the Mall or the Alameda--the
latter rather, since his elegant suit of violet taffetas with
gold-embroidered button-holes was in the Spanish fashion. But the long,
stout, serviceable rapier, thrust up behind by the left hand resting
lightly on the pummel, corrected the impression. That and those steely
eyes of his announced the adventurer.
NA
before the Breton, whose anger seemed already to have gone out of him.

has brought about our danger. But whose is the fault of that delay? We

NA
â€œWas it any one elseâ€™s fault that you ran your ship La Foudre aground on
the shoal in the middle of the lake? You would not be piloted. You knew
your way. You took no soundings even. The result was that we lost three
precious days in getting canoes to bring off your men and your gear.
Those three days gave the folk at Gibraltar not only time to hear of our
coming, but time in which to get away. After that, and because of it,
we had to follow the Governor to his infernal island fortress, and a
fortnight and best part of a hundred lives were lost in reducing it.
Thatâ€™s how we come to have delayed until this Spanish fleet is fetched
round from La Guayra by a guarda-costa; and if ye hadnâ€™t lost La Foudre,
and so reduced our fleet from three ships to two, we should even now be
able to fight our way through with a reasonable hope of succeeding.
Yet you think it is for you to come hectoring here, upbraiding us for a
NA
He spoke with a restraint which I trust you will agree was admirable
when I tell you that the Spanish fleet guarding the bottle-neck exit
of the great Lake of Maracaybo, and awaiting there the coming forth
of Captain Blood with a calm confidence based upon its overwhelming
strength, was commanded by his implacable enemy, Don Miguel de Espinosa
y Valdez, the Admiral of Spain. In addition to his duty to his country,
the Admiral had, as you know, a further personal incentive arising out
of that business aboard the Encarnacion a year ago, and the death of
his brother Don Diego; and with him sailed his nephew Esteban, whose
vindictive zeal exceeded the Admiralâ€™s own.
Yet, knowing all this, Captain Blood could preserve his calm in
reproving the cowardly frenzy of one for whom the situation had not half
the peril with which it was fraught for himself. He turned from Cahusac
to address the mob of buccaneers, who had surged nearer to hear him, for
he had not troubled to raise his voice. â€œI hope that will correct some
NA
he.
NA
Cahusac, more sullen now than truculent. Whereupon Wolverstone laughed,
a laugh that was like the neighing of a horse. â€œThe question is: what

no damage to the town, release our prisoners, and surrender all that we

Captain Blood smiled quietly, knowing precisely how much Don Miguelâ€™s
word was worth. It was Yberville who replied, in manifest scorn of his
compatriot:
â€œWhich argues that, even at this disadvantage as he has us, the Spanish

NA
retort. â€œAnd, anyway, we must accept these terms. We have no choice.

behind enheartened him. â€œYou have refuseâ€™? You have refuseâ€™ already--and
NA
â€œYour disagreement could have altered nothing. Youâ€™d have been outvoted,
NA
â€œif you and your own French followers wish to avail yourselves of the
Spaniardâ€™s terms, we shall not hinder you. Send one of your prisoners to
announce it to the Admiral. Don Miguel will welcome your decision, you
NA
Cahusac glowered at him in silence for a moment. Then, having controlled
himself, he asked in a concentrated voice:
NA
A smile irradiated the face and eyes of Captain Blood. â€œI have answered
him that unless within four-and-twenty hours we have his parole to stand
out to sea, ceasing to dispute our passage or hinder our departure,
and a ransom of fifty thousand pieces of eight for Maracaybo, we shall
reduce this beautiful city to ashes, and thereafter go out and destroy
NA
The impudence of it left Cahusac speechless. But among the English
buccaneers in the square there were many who savoured the audacious
humour of the trapped dictating terms to the trappers. Laughter broke
from them. It spread into a roar of acclamation; for bluff is a weapon
dear to every adventurer. Presently, when they understood it, even
Cahusacâ€™s French followers were carried off their feet by that wave of
jocular enthusiasm, until in his truculent obstinacy Cahusac remained
the only dissentient. He withdrew in mortification. Nor was he to be
mollified until the following day brought him his revenge. This came
in the shape of a messenger from Don Miguel with a letter in which
the Spanish Admiral solemnly vowed to God that, since the pirates had
refused his magnanimous offer to permit them to surrender with the
honours of war, he would now await them at the mouth of the lake there
to destroy them on their coming forth. He added that should they delay
their departure, he would so soon as he was reenforced by a fifth ship,
the Santo Nino, on its way to join him from La Guayra, himself come
inside to seek them at Maracaybo.
This time Captain Blood was put out of temper.
NA
again. â€œSend word to Don Miguel that you have seceded from me. Heâ€™ll
give you safe conduct, devil a doubt. Then take one of the sloops, order
NA
Cahusac would certainly have adopted that course if only his men had
been unanimous in the matter. They, however, were torn between greed and
apprehension. If they went they must abandon their share of the plunder,
which was considerable, as well as the slaves and other prisoners
they had taken. If they did this, and Captain Blood should afterwards
contrive to get away unscathed--and from their knowledge of his
resourcefulness, the thing, however unlikely, need not be impossible--he
must profit by that which they now relinquished. This was a contingency
too bitter for contemplation. And so, in the end, despite all that
Cahusac could say, the surrender was not to Don Miguel, but to Peter
Blood. They had come into the venture with him, they asserted, and
they would go out of it with him or not at all. That was the message
he received from them that same evening by the sullen mouth of Cahusac
himself.
He welcomed it, and invited the Breton to sit down and join the council
which was even then deliberating upon the means to be employed. This
council occupied the spacious patio of the Governorâ€™s house--which
Captain Blood had appropriated to his own uses--a cloistered stone
quadrangle in the middle of which a fountain played coolly under a
trellis of vine. Orange-trees grew on two sides of it, and the still,
evening air was heavy with the scent of them. It was one of those
pleasant exterior-interiors which Moorish architects had introduced to
Spain and the Spaniards had carried with them to the New World.
Here that council of war, composed of six men in all, deliberated until
late that night upon the plan of action which Captain Blood put forward.
The great freshwater lake of Maracaybo, nourished by a score of rivers
from the snow-capped ranges that surround it on two sides, is some
hundred and twenty miles in length and almost the same distance across
at its widest. It is--as has been indicated--in the shape of a great
bottle having its neck towards the sea at Maracaybo.
Beyond this neck it widens again, and then the two long, narrow strips
of land known as the islands of Vigilias and Palomas block the channel,
standing lengthwise across it. The only passage out to sea for vessels
of any draught lies in the narrow strait between these islands. Palomas,
which is some ten miles in length, is unapproachable for half a mile
on either side by any but the shallowest craft save at its eastern end,
where, completely commanding the narrow passage out to sea, stands the
massive fort which the buccaneers had found deserted upon their coming.
In the broader water between this passage and the bar, the four Spanish
ships were at anchor in mid-channel. The Admiralâ€™s Encarnacion, which we
already know, was a mighty galleon of forty-eight great guns and eight
small. Next in importance was the Salvador with thirty-six guns; the
other two, the Infanta and the San Felipe, though smaller vessels, were
still formidable enough with their twenty guns and a hundred and fifty
men apiece.
Such was the fleet of which the gauntlet was to be run by Captain Blood
with his own Arabella of forty guns, the Elizabeth of twenty-six, and
two sloops captured at Gibraltar, which they had indifferently armed
with four culverins each. In men they had a bare four hundred survivors
of the five hundred-odd that had left Tortuga, to oppose to fully a
thousand Spaniards manning the galleons.
The plan of action submitted by Captain Blood to that council was a
desperate one, as Cahusac uncompromisingly pronounced it.

which they had brought away some hogsheads. â€œAnd what is more, theyâ€™ve

NA
He breathed into his companions and even into Cahusac some of his own
spirit of confidence, and in confidence all went busily to work. For
three days from sunrise to sunset, the buccaneers laboured and sweated
to complete the preparations for the action that was to procure them
their deliverance. Time pressed. They must strike before Don Miguel de
Espinosa received the reenforcement of that fifth galleon, the Santo
Nino, which was coming to join him from La Guayra.
Their principal operations were on the larger of the two sloops captured
at Gibraltar; to which vessel was assigned the leading part in Captain
Bloodâ€™s scheme. They began by tearing down all bulkheads, until they
had reduced her to the merest shell, and in her sides they broke open
so many ports that her gunwale was converted into the semblance of a
grating. Next they increased by a half-dozen the scuttles in her deck,
whilst into her hull they packed all the tar and pitch and brimstone
that they could find in the town, to which they added six barrels of
gunpowder, placed on end like guns at the open ports on her larboard
side. On the evening of the fourth day, everything being now in
readiness, all were got aboard, and the empty, pleasant city of
Maracaybo was at last abandoned. But they did not weigh anchor until
some two hours after midnight. Then, at last, on the first of the ebb,
they drifted silently down towards the bar with all canvas furled save
only their spiltsails, which, so as to give them steering way, were
spread to the faint breeze that stirred through the purple darkness of
the tropical night.
The order of their going was as follows: Ahead went the improvised
fire-ship in charge of Wolverstone, with a crew of six volunteers, each
of whom was to have a hundred pieces of eight over and above his share
of plunder as a special reward. Next came the Arabella. She was followed
at a distance by the Elizabeth, commanded by Hagthorpe, with whom was
the now shipless Cahusac and the bulk of his French followers. The rear
was brought up by the second sloop and some eight canoes, aboard of
which had been shipped the prisoners, the slaves, and most of the
captured merchandise. The prisoners were all pinioned, and guarded by
four buccaneers with musketoons who manned these boats in addition to
the two fellows who were to sail them. Their place was to be in the rear
and they were to take no part whatever in the coming fight.
As the first glimmerings of opalescent dawn dissolved the darkness, the
straining eyes of the buccaneers were able to make out the tall rigging
of the Spanish vessels, riding at anchor less than a quarter of a mile
ahead. Entirely without suspicion as the Spaniards were, and rendered
confident by their own overwhelming strength, it is unlikely that they
used a vigilance keener than their careless habit. Certain it is that
they did not sight Bloodâ€™s fleet in that dim light until some time
after Bloodâ€™s fleet had sighted them. By the time that they had actively
roused themselves, Wolverstoneâ€™s sloop was almost upon them, speeding
under canvas which had been crowded to her yards the moment the galleons
had loomed into view.
Straight for the Admiralâ€™s great ship, the Encarnacion, did Wolverstone
head the sloop; then, lashing down the helm, he kindled from a match
that hung ready lighted beside him a great torch of thickly plaited
straw that had been steeped in bitumen. First it glowed, then as he
swung it round his head, it burst into flame, just as the slight vessel
went crashing and bumping and scraping against the side of the flagship,
whilst rigging became tangled with rigging, to the straining of yards
and snapping of spars overhead. His six men stood at their posts on the
larboard side, stark naked, each armed with a grapnel, four of them on
the gunwale, two of them aloft. At the moment of impact these grapnels
were slung to bind the Spaniard to them, those aloft being intended to
complete and preserve the entanglement of the rigging.
Aboard the rudely awakened galleon all was confused hurrying, scurrying,
trumpeting, and shouting. At first there had been a desperately hurried
attempt to get up the anchor; but this was abandoned as being already
too late; and conceiving themselves on the point of being boarded,
the Spaniards stood to arms to ward off the onslaught. Its slowness in
coming intrigued them, being so different from the usual tactics of the
buccaneers. Further intrigued were they by the sight of the gigantic
Wolverstone speeding naked along his deck with a great flaming torch
held high. Not until he had completed his work did they begin to suspect
the truth--that he was lighting slow-matches--and then one of their
officers rendered reckless by panic ordered a boarding-party on to the
shop.
The order came too late. Wolverstone had seen his six fellows drop
overboard after the grapnels were fixed, and then had sped, himself,
to the starboard gunwale. Thence he flung his flaming torch down the
nearest gaping scuttle into the hold, and thereupon dived overboard in
his turn, to be picked up presently by the longboat from the Arabella.
But before that happened the sloop was a thing of fire, from which
explosions were hurling blazing combustibles aboard the Encarnacion, and
long tongues of flame were licking out to consume the galleon, beating
back those daring Spaniards who, too late, strove desperately to cut her
adrift.
And whilst the most formidable vessel of the Spanish fleet was thus
being put out of action at the outset, Blood had sailed in to open fire
upon the Salvador. First athwart her hawse he had loosed a broadside
that had swept her decks with terrific effect, then going on and about,
he had put a second broadside into her hull at short range. Leaving her
thus half-crippled, temporarily, at least, and keeping to his course,
he had bewildered the crew of the Infanta by a couple of shots from the
chasers on his beak-head, then crashed alongside to grapple and board
her, whilst Hagthorpe was doing the like by the San Felipe.
And in all this time not a single shot had the Spaniards contrived to
fire, so completely had they been taken by surprise, and so swift and
paralyzing had been Bloodâ€™s stroke.
Boarded now and faced by the cold steel of the buccaneers, neither the
San Felipe nor the Infanta offered much resistance. The sight of their
admiral in flames, and the Salvador drifting crippled from the action,
had so utterly disheartened them that they accounted themselves
vanquished, and laid down their arms.
If by a resolute stand the Salvador had encouraged the other two
undamaged vessels to resistance, the Spaniards might well have
retrieved the fortunes of the day. But it happened that the Salvador was
handicapped in true Spanish fashion by being the treasure-ship of the
fleet, with plate on board to the value of some fifty thousand pieces.
Intent above all upon saving this from falling into the hands of the
pirates, Don Miguel, who, with a remnant of his crew, had meanwhile
transferred himself aboard her, headed her down towards Palomas and the
fort that guarded the passage. This fort the Admiral, in those days of
waiting, had taken the precaution secretly to garrison and rearm. For
the purpose he had stripped the fort of Cojero, farther out on the gulf,
of its entire armament, which included some cannon-royal of more than
ordinary range and power.
With no suspicion of this, Captain Blood gave chase, accompanied by
the Infanta, which was manned now by a prize-crew under the command of
Yberville. The stern chasers of the Salvador desultorily returned the
punishing fire of the pursuers; but such was the damage she, herself,
sustained, that presently, coming under the guns of the fort, she began
to sink, and finally settled down in the shallows with part of her hull
above water. Thence, some in boats and some by swimming, the Admiral got
his crew ashore on Palomas as best he could.
And then, just as Captain Blood accounted the victory won, and that his
way out of that trap to the open sea beyond lay clear, the fort suddenly
revealed its formidable and utterly unsuspected strength. With a roar
the cannons-royal proclaimed themselves, and the Arabella staggered
under a blow that smashed her bulwarks at the waist and scattered death
and confusion among the seamen gathered there.
Had not Pitt, her master, himself seized the whipstaff and put the helm
hard over to swing her sharply off to starboard, she must have suffered
still worse from the second volley that followed fast upon the first.
Meanwhile it had fared even worse with the frailer Infanta. Although
hit by one shot only, this had crushed her larboard timbers on the
waterline, starting a leak that must presently have filled her, but for
the prompt action of the experienced Yberville in ordering her
larboard guns to be flung overboard. Thus lightened, and listing now
to starboard, he fetched her about, and went staggering after the
retreating Arabella, followed by the fire of the fort, which did them,
however, little further damage.
Out of range, at last, they lay to, joined by the Elizabeth and the San
Felipe, to consider their position.
CHAPTER XVII. THE DUPES
It was a crestfallen Captain Blood who presided over that hastily
summoned council held on the poop-deck of the Arabella in the brilliant
morning sunshine. It was, he declared afterwards, one of the bitterest
moments in his career. He was compelled to digest the fact that having
conducted the engagement with a skill of which he might justly be proud,
having destroyed a force so superior in ships and guns and men that Don
Miguel de Espinosa had justifiably deemed it overwhelming, his victory
was rendered barren by three lucky shots from an unsuspected battery
by which they had been surprised. And barren must their victory remain
until they could reduce the fort that still remained to defend the
passage.
At first Captain Blood was for putting his ships in order and making the
attempt there and then. But the others dissuaded him from betraying an
impetuosity usually foreign to him, and born entirely of chagrin
and mortification, emotions which will render unreasonable the most
reasonable of men. With returning calm, he surveyed the situation. The
Arabella was no longer in case to put to sea; the Infanta was merely
kept afloat by artifice, and the San Felipe was almost as sorely damaged
by the fire she had sustained from the buccaneers before surrendering.
Clearly, then, he was compelled to admit in the end that nothing
remained but to return to Maracaybo, there to refit the ships before
attempting to force the passage.
And so, back to Maracaybo came those defeated victors of that short,
terrible fight. And if anything had been wanting further to exasperate
their leader, he had it in the pessimism of which Cahusac did not
economize expressions. Transported at first to heights of dizzy
satisfaction by the swift and easy victory of their inferior force that
morning, the Frenchman was now plunged back and more deeply than ever
into the abyss of hopelessness. And his mood infected at least the main
body of his own followers.

 Captain Blood answered him as patiently as he could. â€œYet youâ€™ve seen
what youâ€™ve seen, and youâ€™ll not deny that in ships and guns we are

NA
NA
NA
NA
The Breton glared at him, breathing hard. But he had no mind to ask
satisfaction for the insult. He knew too well the kind of satisfaction
that Captain Blood was likely to afford him. He remembered the fate of
Levasseur. So he confined himself to words.
NA
â€œLook you, Cahusac: itâ€™s sick and tired I am of your perpetual whining
and complaining when things are not as smooth as a convent dining-table.
If ye wanted things smooth and easy, ye shouldnâ€™t have taken to the sea,
and ye should never haâ€™ sailed with me, for with me things are never
smooth and easy. And that, I think, is all I have to say to you this
NA
Cahusac flung away cursing, and went to take the feeling of his men.
Captain Blood went off to give his surgeonâ€™s skill to the wounded, among
whom he remained engaged until late afternoon. Then, at last, he went
ashore, his mind made up, and returned to the house of the Governor, to
indite a truculent but very scholarly letter in purest Castilian to Don
Miguel.
NA
wrote. â€œAlthough outnumbered by more than two to one in men, in ships,
and in guns, I have sunk or captured the vessels of the great fleet with
which you were to come to Maracaybo to destroy us. So that you are no
longer in case to carry out your boast, even when your reenforcements
on the Santo Nino, reach you from La Guayra. From what has occurred, you
may judge of what must occur. I should not trouble your excellency with
this letter but that I am a humane man, abhorring bloodshed. Therefore
before proceeding to deal with your fort, which you may deem invincible,
as I have dealt already with your fleet, which you deemed invincible, I
make you, purely out of humanitarian considerations, this last offer of
terms. I will spare this city of Maracaybo and forthwith evacuate it,
leaving behind me the forty prisoners I have taken, in consideration of
your paying me the sum of fifty thousand pieces of eight and one hundred
head of cattle as a ransom, thereafter granting me unmolested passage of
the bar. My prisoners, most of whom are persons of consideration, I will
retain as hostages until after my departure, sending them back in the
canoes which we shall take with us for that purpose. If your excellency
should be so ill-advised as to refuse these terms, and thereby impose
upon me the necessity of reducing your fort at the cost of some lives, I
warn you that you may expect no quarter from us, and that I shall begin
by leaving a heap of ashes where this pleasant city of Maracaybo now
NA
The letter written, he bade them bring him from among the prisoners
the Deputy-Governor of Maracaybo, who had been taken at Gibraltar.
Disclosing its contents to him, he despatched him with it to Don Miguel.
His choice of a messenger was shrewd. The Deputy-Governor was of all men
the most anxious for the deliverance of his city, the one man who on his
own account would plead most fervently for its preservation at all costs
from the fate with which Captain Blood was threatening it. And as he
reckoned so it befell. The Deputy-Governor added his own passionate
pleading to the proposals of the letter.
But Don Miguel was of stouter heart. True, his fleet had been partly
destroyed and partly captured. But then, he argued, he had been taken
utterly by surprise. That should not happen again. There should be no
surprising the fort. Let Captain Blood do his worst at Maracaybo, there
should be a bitter reckoning for him when eventually he decided--as,
sooner or later, decide he must--to come forth. The Deputy-Governor was
flung into panic. He lost his temper, and said some hard things to the
Admiral. But they were not as hard as the thing the Admiral said to him
in answer.
â€œHad you been as loyal to your King in hindering the entrance of these
cursed pirates as I shall be in hindering their going forth again, we
should not now find ourselves in our present straits. So weary me no
more with your coward counsels. I make no terms with Captain Blood. I
know my duty to my King, and I intend to perform it. I also know my
duty to myself. I have a private score with this rascal, and I intend to

So back to Maracaybo, back to his own handsome house in which Captain
Blood had established his quarters, came the Deputy-Governor with the
Admiralâ€™s answer. And because he had been shamed into a show of spirit
by the Admiralâ€™s own stout courage in adversity, he delivered it as
NA
 said Captain Blood with a quiet smile, though the heart of him sank
at this failure of his bluster. â€œWell, well, itâ€™s a pity now that the
Admiralâ€™s so headstrong. It was that way he lost his fleet, which was
his own to lose. This pleasant city of Maracaybo isnâ€™t. So no doubt
heâ€™ll lose it with fewer misgivings. I am sorry. Waste, like bloodshed,
is a thing abhorrent to me. But there ye are! Iâ€™ll have the faggots to
the place in the morning, and maybe when he sees the blaze to-morrow
night heâ€™ll begin to believe that Peter Blood is a man of his word. Ye

The Deputy-Governor went out with dragging feet, followed by guards, his
momentary truculence utterly spent.
But no sooner had he departed than up leapt Cahusac, who had been of the
council assembled to receive the Admiralâ€™s answer. His face was white
and his hands shook as he held them out in protest.
NA
And without waiting to hear what it might be, he raved on: â€œI knew you
not frighten the Admiral so easy. He hold us entrapâ€™, and he knows it;
yet you dream that he will yield himself to your impudent message. Your

â€œThen spare me the rest. Itâ€™ll be of the same quality, devil a doubt,

a question, it was a demand.
â€œHow the devil do I know? I was hoping youâ€™d have some ideas yourself.
But since Yeâ€™re so desperately concerned to save your skin, you and
those that think like you are welcome to leave us. Iâ€™ve no doubt at all
the Spanish Admiral will welcome the abatement of our numbers even at
this late date. Ye shall have the sloop as a parting gift from us, and
ye can join Don Miguel in the fort for all I care, or for all the good
NA
NA
on that stalked out to talk to them, leaving the others to deliberate in
peace.
Next morning early he sought Captain Blood again. He found him alone
in the patio, pacing to and fro, his head sunk on his breast. Cahusac
mistook consideration for dejection. Each of us carries in himself a
standard by which to measure his neighbour.
NA
sullenness and defiance. Captain Blood paused, shoulders hunched, hands
behind his back, and mildly regarded the buccaneer in silence. Cahusac
explained himself. â€œLast night I send one of my men to the Spanish
Admiral with a letter. I make him offer to capitulate if he will accord
us passage with the honours of war. This morning I receive his answer.
He accord us this on the understanding that we carry nothing away with
NA
NA
again to resume his interrupted mediation.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Cahusac flung away, obscenely vituperative. Before noon he was under way
with his followers, some sixty dejected men who had allowed themselves
to be persuaded by him into that empty-handed departure--in spite even
of all that Yberville could do to prevent it. The Admiral kept faith
with him, and allowed him free passage out to sea, which, from his
knowledge of Spaniards, was more than Captain Blood had expected.
Meanwhile, no sooner had the deserters weighed anchor than Captain Blood
received word that the Deputy-Governor begged to be allowed to see him
again. Admitted, Don Francisco at once displayed the fact that a nightâ€™s
reflection had quickened his apprehensions for the city of Maracaybo and
his condemnation of the Admiralâ€™s intransigence.
Captain Blood received him pleasantly.
â€œGood-morning to you, Don Francisco. I have postponed the bonfire until
NA
Don Francisco, a slight, nervous, elderly man of high lineage and low
vitality, came straight to business.
â€œI am here to tell you, Don Pedro, that if you will hold your hand for
three days, I will undertake to raise the ransom you demand, which Don

Captain Blood confronted him, a frown contracting the dark brows above
his light eyes:

interrupted.
â€œBy the Saints! Yeâ€™re a bold man, Don Francisco, to come to me with such
a tale--to tell me that ye know where the ransomâ€™s to be raised, and yet
to refuse to say. Dâ€™ye think now that with a match between your fingers

If Don Francisco grew a shade paler, yet again he shook his head.
â€œThat was the way of Morgan and Lâ€™Ollonais and other pirates. But it is
not the way of Captain Blood. If I had doubted that I should not have

Captain Blood laughed again, on a bitter, sneering note that made Don
Francisco fear the worst. He was not to guess that it was himself the
Captain mocked.
â€œThatâ€™s merely because itâ€™s more remunerative in the end. And that
is why you are accorded the three days you ask for. So about it, Don
NA
Away went Don Francisco on his errand, leaving Captain Blood to reflect,
between bitterness and satisfaction, that a reputation for as much
chivalry as is consistent with piracy is not without its uses.
Punctually on the third day the Deputy-Governor was back in Maracaybo
with his mules laden with plate and money to the value demanded and a
herd of a hundred head of cattle driven in by negro slaves.
These bullocks were handed over to those of the company who ordinarily
were boucan-hunters, and therefore skilled in the curing of meats, and
for best part of a week thereafter they were busy at the waterside with
the quartering and salting of carcases.
While this was doing on the one hand and the ships were being refitted
for sea on the other, Captain Blood was pondering the riddle on the
solution of which his own fate depended. Indian spies whom he employed
brought him word that the Spaniards, working at low tide, had salved the
thirty guns of the Salvador, and thus had added yet another battery
to their already overwhelming strength. In the end, and hoping for
inspiration on the spot, Captain Blood made a reconnaissance in person.
At the risk of his life, accompanied by two friendly Indians, he crossed
to the island in a canoe under cover of dark. They concealed themselves
and the canoe in the short thick scrub with which that side of the
island was densely covered, and lay there until daybreak. Then Blood
went forward alone, and with infinite precaution, to make his survey. He
went to verify a suspicion that he had formed, and approached the fort
as nearly as he dared and a deal nearer than was safe.
On all fours he crawled to the summit of an eminence a mile or so away,
whence he found himself commanding a view of the interior dispositions
of the stronghold. By the aid of a telescope with which he had equipped
himself he was able to verify that, as he had suspected and hoped, the
fortâ€™s artillery was all mounted on the seaward side.
Satisfied, he returned to Maracaybo, and laid before the six who
composed his council--Pitt, Hagthorpe, Yberville, Wolverstone, Dyke, and
Ogle--a proposal to storm the fort from the landward side. Crossing
to the island under cover of night, they would take the Spaniards by
surprise and attempt to overpower them before they could shift their
guns to meet the onslaught.
With the exception of Wolverstone, who was by temperament the kind of
man who favours desperate chances, those officers received the proposal
coldly. Hagthorpe incontinently opposed it.

The others--Dyke, Ogle, Yberville, and even Pitt, whom loyalty to Blood
may have made reluctant--loudly approved him. When they had done, â€œI

He broke off abruptly. A moment he frowned, deep in thought; then his
face was suddenly alight with inspiration. Slowly he drooped his head,
and sat there considering, weighing, chin on breast. Then he nodded,

NA
Whether or not, I have thought of a better way. That which should have
been the real attack shall be no more than a feint. Here, then, is the

He talked swiftly and clearly, and as he talked one by one his officersâ€™
faces became alight with eagerness. When he had done, they cried as with
one voice that he had saved them.
NA
Since for the last twenty-four hours all had been in readiness for
departure, there was nothing now to delay them, and it was decided to
move next morning.
Such was Captain Bloodâ€™s assurance of success that he immediately freed
the prisoners held as hostages, and even the negro slaves, who were
regarded by the others as legitimate plunder. His only precaution
against those released prisoners was to order them into the church
and there lock them up, to await deliverance at the hands of those who
should presently be coming into the city.
Then, all being aboard the three ships, with the treasure safely stowed
in their holds and the slaves under hatches, the buccaneers weighed
anchor and stood out for the bar, each vessel towing three piraguas
astern.
The Admiral, beholding their stately advance in the full light of noon,
their sails gleaming white in the glare of the sunlight, rubbed his
long, lean hands in satisfaction, and laughed through his teeth.

He turned to issue orders, and the fort became lively as a hive. The
guns were manned, the gunners already kindling fuses, when the buccaneer
fleet, whilst still heading for Palomas, was observed to bear away to
the west. The Spaniards watched them, intrigued.
Within a mile and a half to westward of the fort, and within a half-mile
of the shore--that is to say, on the very edge of the shoal water that
makes Palomas unapproachable on either side by any but vessels of
the shallowest draught--the four ships cast anchor well within the
Spaniardsâ€™ view, but just out of range of their heaviest cannon.
Sneeringly the Admiral laughed.

NA
elbow quivering with excitement.
Don Miguel looked at him, smiling. â€œAnd what shall the night avail them
in this narrow passage, under the very muzzles of my guns? Be sure,
NA
He raised his telescope to continue his observation of the buccaneers.
He saw that the piraguas towed by each vessel were being warped
alongside, and he wondered a little what this manoeuver might portend.
Awhile those piraguas were hidden from view behind the hulls. Then one
by one they reappeared, rowing round and away from the ships, and each
boat, he observed, was crowded with armed men. Thus laden, they were
headed for the shore, at a point where it was densely wooded to the
waterâ€™s edge. The eyes of the wondering Admiral followed them until the
foliage screened them from his view.
Then he lowered his telescope and looked at his officers.

None answered him, all being as puzzled as he was himself.
After a little while, Esteban, who kept his eyes on the water, plucked

And there, indeed, went the piraguas on their way back to the ships.
But now it was observed that they were empty, save for the men who rowed
them. Their armed cargo had been left ashore.
Back to the ships they pulled, to return again presently with a fresh
load of armed men, which similarly they conveyed to Palomas. And at last
one of the Spanish officers ventured an explanation:
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œA sally? Through that scrub? That would be to play into their hands.
No, no, we will wait here to receive this attack. Whenever it comes, it
NA
But by evening the Admiralâ€™s equanimity was not quite so perfect. By
then the piraguas had made a half-dozen journeys with their loads
of men, and they had landed also--as Don Miguel had clearly observed
through his telescope--at least a dozen guns.
His countenance no longer smiled; it was a little wrathful and a little
troubled now as he turned again to his officers.
â€œWho was the fool who told me that they number but three hundred men in
NA
Amazed as he was, his amazement would have been deeper had he been told
the truth: that there was not a single buccaneer or a single gun ashore
on Palomas. The deception had been complete. Don Miguel could not guess
that the men he had beheld in those piraguas were always the same; that
on the journeys to the shore they sat and stood upright in full view;
and that on the journeys back to the ships, they lay invisible at the
bottom of the boats, which were thus made to appear empty.
The growing fears of the Spanish soldiery at the prospect of a night
attack from the landward side by the entire buccaneer force--and a
force twice as strong as they had suspected the pestilent Blood to
command--began to be communicated to the Admiral.
In the last hours of fading daylight, the Spaniards did precisely what
Captain Blood so confidently counted that they would do--precisely what
they must do to meet the attack, preparations for which had been so
thoroughly simulated. They set themselves to labour like the damned at
those ponderous guns emplaced to command the narrow passage out to sea.
Groaning and sweating, urged on by the curses and even the whips of
their officers, they toiled in a frenzy of panic-stricken haste to shift
the greater number and the more powerful of their guns across to the
landward side, there to emplace them anew, so that they might be ready
to receive the attack which at any moment now might burst upon them from
the woods not half a mile away.
Thus, when night fell, although in mortal anxiety of the onslaught of
those wild devils whose reckless courage was a byword on the seas of the
Main, at least the Spaniards were tolerably prepared for it. Waiting,
they stood to their guns.
And whilst they waited thus, under cover of the darkness and as the tide
began to ebb, Captain Bloodâ€™s fleet weighed anchor quietly; and, as once
before, with no more canvas spread than that which their sprits could
carry, so as to give them steering way--and even these having been
painted black--the four vessels, without a light showing, groped their
way by soundings to the channel which led to that narrow passage out to
sea.
The Elizabeth and the Infanta, leading side by side, were almost abreast
of the fort before their shadowy bulks and the soft gurgle of water at
their prows were detected by the Spaniards, whose attention until that
moment had been all on the other side. And now there arose on the night
air such a sound of human baffled fury as may have resounded about Babel
at the confusion of tongues. To heighten that confusion, and to scatter
disorder among the Spanish soldiery, the Elizabeth emptied her larboard
guns into the fort as she was swept past on the swift ebb.
At once realizing--though not yet how--he had been duped, and that his
prey was in the very act of escaping after all, the Admiral frantically
ordered the guns that had been so laboriously moved to be dragged back
to their former emplacements, and commanded his gunners meanwhile to
the slender batteries that of all his powerful, but now unavailable,
armament still remained trained upon the channel. With these, after the
loss of some precious moments, the fort at last made fire.
It was answered by a terrific broadside from the Arabella, which had
now drawn abreast, and was crowding canvas to her yards. The enraged
and gibbering Spaniards had a brief vision of her as the line of flame
spurted from her red flank, and the thunder of her broadside drowned
the noise of the creaking halyards. After that they saw her no more.
Assimilated by the friendly darkness which the lesser Spanish guns were
speculatively stabbing, the escaping ships fired never another shot that
might assist their baffled and bewildered enemies to locate them.
Some slight damage was sustained by Bloodâ€™s fleet. But by the time the
Spaniards had resolved their confusion into some order of dangerous
offence, that fleet, well served by a southerly breeze, was through the
narrows and standing out to sea.
Thus was Don Miguel de Espinosa left to chew the bitter cud of a lost
opportunity, and to consider in what terms he would acquaint the
Supreme Council of the Catholic King that Peter Blood had got away from
Maracaybo, taking with him two twenty-gun frigates that were lately
the property of Spain, to say nothing of two hundred and fifty thousand
pieces of eight and other plunder. And all this in spite of Don Miguelâ€™s
four galleons and his heavily armed fort that at one time had held the
pirates so securely trapped.
Heavy, indeed, grew the account of Peter Blood, which Don Miguel swore
passionately to Heaven should at all costs to himself be paid in full.
Nor were the losses already detailed the full total of those suffered
on this occasion by the King of Spain. For on the following evening,
off the coast of Oruba, at the mouth of the Gulf of Venezuela, Captain
Bloodâ€™s fleet came upon the belated Santo Nino, speeding under full sail
to reenforce Don Miguel at Maracaybo.
At first the Spaniard had conceived that she was meeting the victorious
fleet of Don Miguel, returning from the destruction of the pirates. When
at comparatively close quarters the pennon of St. George soared to the
Arabellaâ€™s masthead to disillusion her, the Santo Nino chose the better
part of valour, and struck her flag.
Captain Blood ordered her crew to take to the boats, and land themselves
at Oruba or wherever else they pleased. So considerate was he that to
assist them he presented them with several of the piraguas which he
still had in tow.

Barbados. Bid him think twice before he lets his devils loose upon an

With that he dismissed the Captain, who went over the side of the Santo

further prize. When her hatches were removed, a human cargo was

devilry until Cahusac crawled up out of the dark bowels of the ship, and
stood blinking in the sunlight.
There was more than sunlight to make the Breton pirate blink. And
those that crawled out after him--the remnants of his crew--cursed him
horribly for the pusillanimity which had brought them into the ignominy
of owing their deliverance to those whom they had deserted as lost
beyond hope.
Their sloop had encountered and had been sunk three days ago by the
Santo Nino, and Cahusac had narrowly escaped hanging merely that for
some time he might be a mock among the Brethren of the Coast.
For many a month thereafter he was to hear in Tortuga the jeering taunt:
NA
CHAPTER XVIII. THE MILAGROSA
The affair at Maracaybo is to be considered as Captain Bloodâ€™s
buccaneering masterpiece. Although there is scarcely one of the many
actions that he fought--recorded in such particular detail by Jeremy
Pitt--which does not afford some instance of his genius for naval
tactics, yet in none is this more shiningly displayed than in those two
engagements by which he won out of the trap which Don Miguel de Espinosa
had sprung upon him.
The fame which he had enjoyed before this, great as it already was, is
dwarfed into insignificance by the fame that followed. It was a fame
such as no buccaneer--not even Morgan--has ever boasted, before or
since.
In Tortuga, during the months he spent there refitting the three ships
he had captured from the fleet that had gone out to destroy him, he
found himself almost an object of worship in the eyes of the wild
Brethren of the Coast, all of whom now clamoured for the honour of
serving under him. It placed him in the rare position of being able
to pick and choose the crews for his augmented fleet, and he chose
fastidiously. When next he sailed away it was with a fleet of five fine
ships in which went something over a thousand men. Thus you behold him
not merely famous, but really formidable. The three captured Spanish
vessels he had renamed with a certain scholarly humour the Clotho,
Lachesis, and Atropos, a grimly jocular manner of conveying to the world
that he made them the arbiters of the fate of any Spaniards he should
henceforth encounter upon the seas.
In Europe the news of this fleet, following upon the news of the Spanish
Admiralâ€™s defeat at Maracaybo, produced something of a sensation. Spain
and England were variously and unpleasantly exercised, and if you care
to turn up the diplomatic correspondence exchanged on the subject, you
will find that it is considerable and not always amiable.
And meanwhile in the Caribbean, the Spanish Admiral Don Miguel de
Espinosa might be said--to use a term not yet invented in his day--to
have run amok. The disgrace into which he had fallen as a result of the
disasters suffered at the hands of Captain Blood had driven the Admiral
all but mad. It is impossible, if we impose our minds impartially,
to withhold a certain sympathy from Don Miguel. Hate was now this
unfortunate manâ€™s daily bread, and the hope of vengeance an obsession to
his mind. As a madman he went raging up and down the Caribbean seeking
his enemy, and in the meantime, as an hors dâ€™oeuvre to his vindictive
appetite, he fell upon any ship of England or of France that loomed
above his horizon.
I need say no more to convey the fact that this illustrious sea-captain
and great gentleman of Castile had lost his head, and was become a
pirate in his turn. The Supreme Council of Castile might anon condemn
him for his practices. But how should that matter to one who already was
condemned beyond redemption? On the contrary, if he should live to lay
the audacious and ineffable Blood by the heels, it was possible that
Spain might view his present irregularities and earlier losses with a
more lenient eye.
And so, reckless of the fact that Captain Blood was now in vastly
superior strength, the Spaniard sought him up and down the trackless
seas. But for a whole year he sought him vainly. The circumstances in
which eventually they met are very curious.
An intelligent observation of the facts of human existence will reveal
to shallow-minded folk who sneer at the use of coincidence in the arts
of fiction and drama that life itself is little more than a series of
coincidences. Open the history of the past at whatsoever page you will,
and there you shall find coincidence at work bringing about events that
the merest chance might have averted. Indeed, coincidence may be defined
as the very tool used by Fate to shape the destinies of men and nations.
Observe it now at work in the affairs of Captain Blood and of some
others.
On the 15th September of the year 1688--a memorable year in the annals
of England--three ships were afloat upon the Caribbean, which in their
coming conjunctions were to work out the fortunes of several persons.
The first of these was Captain Bloodâ€™s flagship the Arabella, which had
been separated from the buccaneer fleet in a hurricane off the Lesser
Antilles. In somewhere about 17 deg. N. Lat., and 74 deg. Long., she
was beating up for the Windward Passage, before the intermittent
southeasterly breezes of that stifling season, homing for Tortuga, the
natural rendezvous of the dispersed vessels.
The second ship was the great Spanish galleon, the Milagrosa, which,
accompanied by the smaller frigate Hidalga, lurked off the Caymites,
to the north of the long peninsula that thrusts out from the southwest
corner of Hispaniola. Aboard the Milagrosa sailed the vindictive Don
Miguel.
The third and last of these ships with which we are at present concerned
was an English man-of-war, which on the date I have given was at anchor
in the French port of St. Nicholas on the northwest coast of Hispaniola.
She was on her way from Plymouth to Jamaica, and carried on board a
very distinguished passenger in the person of Lord Julian Wade, who
came charged by his kinsman, my Lord Sunderland, with a mission of
some consequence and delicacy, directly arising out of that vexatious
correspondence between England and Spain.
The French Government, like the English, excessively annoyed by the
depredations of the buccaneers, and the constant straining of relations
with Spain that ensued, had sought in vain to put them down by enjoining
the utmost severity against them upon her various overseas governors.
But these, either--like the Governor of Tortuga--throve out of a
scarcely tacit partnership with the filibusters, or--like the Governor
of French Hispaniola--felt that they were to be encouraged as a check
upon the power and greed of Spain, which might otherwise be exerted to
the disadvantage of the colonies of other nations. They looked, indeed,
with apprehension upon recourse to any vigorous measures which must
result in driving many of the buccaneers to seek new hunting-grounds in
the South Sea.
To satisfy King Jamesâ€™s anxiety to conciliate Spain, and in response to
the Spanish Ambassadorâ€™s constant and grievous expostulations, my Lord
Sunderland, the Secretary of State, had appointed a strong man to the
deputy-governorship of Jamaica. This strong man was that Colonel
Bishop who for some years now had been the most influential planter in
Barbados.
Colonel Bishop had accepted the post, and departed from the plantations
in which his great wealth was being amassed with an eagerness that had
its roots in a desire to pay off a score of his own with Peter Blood.
From his first coming to Jamaica, Colonel Bishop had made himself felt
by the buccaneers. But do what he might, the one buccaneer whom he
made his particular quarry--that Peter Blood who once had been his
slave--eluded him ever, and continued undeterred and in great force
to harass the Spaniards upon sea and land, and to keep the relations
between England and Spain in a state of perpetual ferment, particularly
dangerous in those days when the peace of Europe was precariously
maintained.
Exasperated not only by his own accumulated chagrin, but also by the
reproaches for his failure which reached him from London, Colonel Bishop
actually went so far as to consider hunting his quarry in Tortuga
itself and making an attempt to clear the island of the buccaneers it
sheltered. Fortunately for himself, he abandoned the notion of so insane
an enterprise, deterred not only by the enormous natural strength of the
place, but also by the reflection that a raid upon what was, nominally
at least, a French settlement, must be attended by grave offence to
France. Yet short of some such measure, it appeared to Colonel Bishop
that he was baffled. He confessed as much in a letter to the Secretary
of State.
This letter and the state of things which it disclosed made my Lord
Sunderland despair of solving this vexatious problem by ordinary means.
He turned to the consideration of extraordinary ones, and bethought him
of the plan adopted with Morgan, who had been enlisted into the Kingâ€™s
service under Charles II. It occurred to him that a similar course might
be similarly effective with Captain Blood. His lordship did not omit
the consideration that Bloodâ€™s present outlawry might well have been
undertaken not from inclination, but under stress of sheer necessity;
that he had been forced into it by the circumstances of his
transportation, and that he would welcome the opportunity of emerging
from it.
Acting upon this conclusion, Sunderland sent out his kinsman, Lord
Julian Wade, with some commissions made out in blank, and full
directions as to the course which the Secretary considered it desirable
to pursue and yet full discretion in the matter of pursuing them. The
crafty Sunderland, master of all labyrinths of intrigue, advised his
kinsman that in the event of his finding Blood intractable, or judging
for other reasons that it was not desirable to enlist him in the Kingâ€™s
service, he should turn his attention to the officers serving under him,
and by seducing them away from him leave him so weakened that he must
fall an easy victim to Colonel Bishopâ€™s fleet.
The Royal Mary--the vessel bearing that ingenious, tolerably
accomplished, mildly dissolute, entirely elegant envoy of my Lord
Sunderlandâ€™s--made a good passage to St. Nicholas, her last port of
call before Jamaica. It was understood that as a preliminary Lord Julian
should report himself to the Deputy-Governor at Port Royal, whence at
need he might have himself conveyed to Tortuga. Now it happened that the
Deputy-Governorâ€™s niece had come to St. Nicholas some months earlier on
a visit to some relatives, and so that she might escape the insufferable
heat of Jamaica in that season. The time for her return being now at
hand, a passage was sought for her aboard the Royal Mary, and in view of
her uncleâ€™s rank and position promptly accorded.
Lord Julian hailed her advent with satisfaction. It gave a voyage that
had been full of interest for him just the spice that it required
to achieve perfection as an experience. His lordship was one of your
gallants to whom existence that is not graced by womankind is more or
less of a stagnation. Miss Arabella Bishop--this straight up and down
slip of a girl with her rather boyish voice and her almost boyish ease
of movement--was not perhaps a lady who in England would have commanded
much notice in my lordâ€™s discerning eyes. His very sophisticated,
carefully educated tastes in such matters inclined him towards the
plump, the languishing, and the quite helplessly feminine. Miss
Bishopâ€™s charms were undeniable. But they were such that it would take a
delicate-minded man to appreciate them; and my Lord Julian, whilst of a
mind that was very far from gross, did not possess the necessary degree
of delicacy. I must not by this be understood to imply anything against
him.
It remained, however, that Miss Bishop was a young woman and a lady; and
in the latitude into which Lord Julian had strayed this was a phenomenon
sufficiently rare to command attention. On his side, with his title and
position, his personal grace and the charm of a practised courtier, he
bore about him the atmosphere of the great world in which normally he
had his being--a world that was little more than a name to her, who had
spent most of her life in the Antilles. It is not therefore wonderful
that they should have been attracted to each other before the Royal
Mary was warped out of St. Nicholas. Each could tell the other much upon
which the other desired information. He could regale her imagination
with stories of St. Jamesâ€™s--in many of which he assigned himself a
heroic, or at least a distinguished part--and she could enrich his mind
with information concerning this new world to which he had come.
Before they were out of sight of St. Nicholas they were good friends,
and his lordship was beginning to correct his first impressions of her
and to discover the charm of that frank, straightforward attitude of
comradeship which made her treat every man as a brother. Considering
how his mind was obsessed with the business of his mission, it is not
wonderful that he should have come to talk to her of Captain Blood.
Indeed, there was a circumstance that directly led to it.
NA

Miss Bishop halted. She leaned upon the taffrail, looking out towards
the receding land, and it was a moment before she answered in a steady,
level voice:

NA
imperturbability that he had studiously cultivated. He was a young man
of perhaps eight-and-twenty, well above the middle height in stature
and appearing taller by virtue of his exceeding leanness. He had a thin,
pale, rather pleasing hatchet-face, framed in the curls of a golden
periwig, a sensitive mouth and pale blue eyes that lent his countenance
a dreamy expression, a rather melancholy pensiveness. But they were
alert, observant eyes notwithstanding, although they failed on this
occasion to observe the slight change of colour which his question had
brought to Miss Bishopâ€™s cheeks or the suspiciously excessive composure
of her answer.

ignorant when he committed what was construed into treason. But, faith,

She shook her head without replying. She had averted her face, and her
eyes were staring down at the gently heaving water. After a moment she
spoke, her voice steady and perfectly controlled.
â€œBut surely, if this were true, there would have been an end to his
piracy by now. If he... if he loved a woman and was betrothed, and was
also rich as you say, surely he would have abandoned this desperate

explanation. Dâ€™Ogeron is avaricious for himself and for his child. And
as for the girl, Iâ€™m told sheâ€™s a wild piece, fit mate for such a man as
Blood. Almost I marvel that he doesnâ€™t marry her and take her a-roving
with him. It would be no new experience for her. And I marvel, too, at

â€œYes--a French buccaneer named Levasseur. He was the girlâ€™s lover and

She had turned to face him. She was pale to the lips, and her hazel eyes
were blazing, as she cut into his apologies for Blood.

â€œA man who sailed with them, a Frenchman named Cahusac, whom I found in
a waterside tavern in St. Nicholas. He was Levasseurâ€™s lieutenant,

lordship with that question. Later he was to remember and perceive in
her present behaviour a certain oddness which went disregarded now.
â€œBlood purchased their consent, and his right to carry the girl off. He
paid them in pearls that were worth more than twenty thousand pieces of

price! Faith, theyâ€™re scoundrels all--just thieving, venal curs. And

She looked away from him again, and found that her sight was blurred.
After a moment in a voice less steady than before she asked him:
â€œWhy should this Frenchman have told you such a tale? Did he hate this
NA
NA
just as a commonplace, an instance of buccaneering ways.
NA
â€œI dare say that we are all savages under the cloak that civilization

â€œAs we are sorry to hear of the death of one we have esteemed. Once I

And upon that she passed at once to speak of other things. The
friendship, which it was her great gift to command in all she met, grew
steadily between those two in the little time remaining, until the event
befell that marred what was promising to be the pleasantest stage of his
lordshipâ€™s voyage.
The marplot was the mad-dog Spanish Admiral, whom they encountered on
the second day out, when halfway across the Gulf of Gonaves. The Captain
of the Royal Mary was not disposed to be intimidated even when Don
Miguel opened fire on him. Observing the Spaniardâ€™s plentiful seaboard
towering high above the water and offering him so splendid a mark,
the Englishman was moved to scorn. If this Don who flew the banner of
Castile wanted a fight, the Royal Mary was just the ship to oblige him.
It may be that he was justified of his gallant confidence, and that
he would that day have put an end to the wild career of Don Miguel de
Espinosa, but that a lucky shot from the Milagrosa got among some powder
stored in his forecastle, and blew up half his ship almost before the
fight had started. How the powder came there will never now be known,
and the gallant Captain himself did not survive to enquire into it.
Before the men of the Royal Mary had recovered from their consternation,
their captain killed and a third of their number destroyed with him, the
ship yawing and rocking helplessly in a crippled state, the Spaniards
boarded her.
In the Captainâ€™s cabin under the poop, to which Miss Bishop had been
conducted for safety, Lord Julian was seeking to comfort and encourage
her, with assurances that all would yet be well, at the very moment when
Don Miguel was stepping aboard. Lord Julian himself was none so steady,
and his face was undoubtedly pale. Not that he was by any means a
coward. But this cooped-up fighting on an unknown element in a thing of
wood that might at any moment founder under his feet into the depths
of ocean was disturbing to one who could be brave enough ashore.
Fortunately Miss Bishop did not appear to be in desperate need of the
poor comfort he was in case to offer. Certainly she, too, was pale, and
her hazel eyes may have looked a little larger than usual. But she had
herself well in hand. Half sitting, half leaning on the Captainâ€™s table,
she preserved her courage sufficiently to seek to calm the octoroon
waiting-woman who was grovelling at her feet in a state of terror.
And then the cabin-door flew open, and Don Miguel himself, tall,
sunburned, and aquiline of face, strode in. Lord Julian span round, to
face him, and clapped a hand to his sword.
The Spaniard was brisk and to the point.
NA
NA
There were three or four men in morions behind Don Miguel, and Lord
Julian realized the position. He released his hilt, and a couple of
feet or so of steel slid softly back into the scabbard. But Don Miguel
smiled, with a flash of white teeth behind his grizzled beard, and held
out his hand.
NA
Lord Julian hesitated. His eyes strayed to Miss Bishopâ€™s. â€œI think you
NA
lordship made the required surrender.
NA
strode out.
They went, of course. For one thing the Spaniard had force to compel
them; for another a ship which he announced to be sinking offered them
little inducement to remain. They stayed no longer than was necessary to
enable Miss Bishop to collect some spare articles of dress and my lord
to snatch up his valise.
As for the survivors in that ghastly shambles that had been the Royal
Mary, they were abandoned by the Spaniards to their own resources. Let
them take to the boats, and if those did not suffice them, let them swim
or drown. If Lord Julian and Miss Bishop were retained, it was because
Don Miguel perceived their obvious value. He received them in his cabin
with great urbanity. Urbanely he desired to have the honour of being
acquainted with their names.
Lord Julian, sick with horror of the spectacle he had just witnessed,
commanded himself with difficulty to supply them. Then haughtily he
demanded to know in his turn the name of their aggressor. He was in
an exceedingly ill temper. He realized that if he had done nothing
positively discreditable in the unusual and difficult position into
which Fate had thrust him, at least he had done nothing creditable.
This might have mattered less but that the spectator of his indifferent
performance was a lady. He was determined if possible to do better now.
NA
NA
Lord Julian gasped. If Spain made such a hubbub about the depredations
of a runagate adventurer like Captain Blood, what could not England
answer now?
NA
And added: â€œI hope you realize what will be the consequences, and the
strict account to which you shall be brought for this dayâ€™s work, for
the blood you have murderously shed, and for your violence to this lady
NA
NA
who holds the trumps can smile. â€œOn the contrary, I have saved your
NA
NA
callous impudence. â€œAnd what of the lives you have destroyed in wanton

Don Miguelâ€™s smile persisted. â€œIt is possible. All things are possible.
Meantime it is your own lives that will cost you dear. Colonel Bishop is
a rich man; and you, milord, are no doubt also rich. I will consider and
NA
NA
 stormed his lordship. â€œAnd you have the impudence to call yourself
the Admiral of the Navies of the Catholic King? We shall see what your

The Admiral ceased to smile. He revealed something of the rage that had

I have the honesty to do it in my own name--but you, you perfidious

against us and disclaim responsibility for what they do. Like Pilate,

Pilate. Let her disclaim responsibility for me, when your ambassador
at the Escurial shall go whining to the Supreme Council of this act of

NA

â€œAre they not? How do I know? How does Spain know? Are you not liars
NA
NA
Instinctively he swung a hand to the place where his sword habitually

NA
The Admiralâ€™s face flamed scarlet. He half raised his hand to strike.
And then, restrained, perhaps, by the very words that had cloaked the
retorting insult, he turned on his heel abruptly and went out without
answering.
CHAPTER XIX. THE MEETING
As the door slammed after the departing Admiral, Lord Julian turned to
Arabella, and actually smiled. He felt that he was doing better, and
gathered from it an almost childish satisfaction--childish in all the
NA
with a toss of his golden ringlets.
Miss Bishop, seated at the cabin-table, looked at him steadily, without
returning his smile. â€œDoes it matter, then, so much, having the last
word? I am thinking of those poor fellows on the Royal Mary. Many of
them have had their last word, indeed. And for what? A fine ship sunk,
a score of lives lost, thrice that number now in jeopardy, and all for
NA
NA
NA
you I am calm. I am asking you a question, Lord Julian. Why has this
NA
NA
explained shortly.
NA
NA
NA
â€œI donâ€™t understand. At Bridgetown three years ago there was a Spanish
raid, and things were done that should have been impossible to men,
horrible, revolting things which strain belief, which seem, when I
think of them now, like the illusions of some evil dream. Are men just

NA
 He was an Englishman speaking of hereditary foes. And yet there was a
measure of truth in what he said. â€œThis is the Spanish way in the New
NA
She shivered, as if cold, and setting her elbows on the table, she took
her chin in her hands, and sat staring before her.
Observing her, his lordship noticed how drawn and white her face had
grown. There was reason enough for that, and for worse. Not any other
woman of his acquaintance would have preserved her self-control in such
an ordeal; and of fear, at least, at no time had Miss Bishop shown any
sign. It is impossible that he did not find her admirable.
A Spanish steward entered bearing a silver chocolate service and a box
of Peruvian candies, which he placed on the table before the lady.
NA
Miss Bishop took no heed of him or his offering, but continued to stare
before her, lost in thought. Lord Julian took a turn in the long low
cabin, which was lighted by a skylight above and great square windows
astern. It was luxuriously appointed: there were rich Eastern rugs on
the floor, well-filled bookcases stood against the bulkheads, and there
was a carved walnut sideboard laden with silverware. On a long, low
chest standing under the middle stern port lay a guitar that was gay
with ribbons. Lord Julian picked it up, twanged the strings once as if
moved by nervous irritation, and put it down.
He turned again to face Miss Bishop.
NA
begin to think that the French are right in desiring piracy to continue
NA
He was to be strongly confirmed in that opinion before many hours
were past. Meanwhile their treatment at the hands of Don Miguel was
considerate and courteous. It confirmed the opinion, contemptuously
expressed to his lordship by Miss Bishop, that since they were to be
held to ransom they need not fear any violence or hurt. A cabin was
placed at the disposal of the lady and her terrified woman, and another
at Lord Julianâ€™s. They were given the freedom of the ship, and bidden to
dine at the Admiralâ€™s table; nor were his further intentions regarding
them mentioned, nor yet his immediate destination.
The Milagrosa, with her consort the Hidalga rolling after her, steered
a south by westerly course, then veered to the southeast round Cape
Tiburon, and thereafter, standing well out to sea, with the land no more
than a cloudy outline to larboard, she headed directly east, and so ran
straight into the arms of Captain Blood, who was making for the Windward
Passage, as we know. That happened early on the following morning. After
having systematically hunted his enemy in vain for a year, Don Miguel
chanced upon him in this unexpected and entirely fortuitous fashion. But
that is the ironic way of Fortune. It was also the way of Fortune that
Don Miguel should thus come upon the Arabella at a time when, separated
from the rest of the fleet, she was alone and at a disadvantage. It
looked to Don Miguel as if the luck which so long had been on Bloodâ€™s
side had at last veered in his own favour.
Miss Bishop, newly risen, had come out to take the air on the
quarter-deck with his lordship in attendance--as you would expect of so
gallant a gentleman--when she beheld the big red ship that had once been
the Cinco Llagas out of Cadiz. The vessel was bearing down upon them,
her mountains of snowy canvas bellying forward, the long pennon with
the cross of St. George fluttering from her main truck in the morning
breeze, the gilded portholes in her red hull and the gilded beak-head
aflash in the morning sun.
Miss Bishop was not to recognize this for that same Cinco Llagas which
she had seen once before--on a tragic day in Barbados three years
ago. To her it was just a great ship that was heading resolutely,
majestically, towards them, and an Englishman to judge by the pennon
she was flying. The sight thrilled her curiously; it awoke in her an
uplifting sense of pride that took no account of the danger to herself
in the encounter that must now be inevitable.
Beside her on the poop, whither they had climbed to obtain a better
view, and equally arrested and at gaze, stood Lord Julian. But he shared
none of her exultation. He had been in his first sea-fight yesterday,
and he felt that the experience would suffice him for a very
considerable time. This, I insist, is no reflection upon his courage.
NA
observed that her eyes were sparkling. Did she realize, he wondered,
what was afoot? Her next sentence resolved his doubt. â€œShe is English,
NA
NA
mad. What can he hope to do against two such heavy hulks as these? If
they could so easily blow the Royal Mary out of the water, what will
they do to this vessel? Look at that devil Don Miguel. Heâ€™s utterly
NA
From the quarter-deck, where he moved amid the frenzy of preparation,
the Admiral had turned to flash a backward glance at his prisoners. His
eyes were alight, his face transfigured. He flung out an arm to point
to the advancing ship, and bawled something in Spanish that was lost to
them in the noise of the labouring crew.
They advanced to the poop-rail, and watched the bustle. Telescope in
hand on the quarter-deck, Don Miguel was issuing his orders. Already the
gunners were kindling their matches; sailors were aloft, taking in sail;
others were spreading a stout rope net above the waist, as a protection
against falling spars. And meanwhile Don Miguel had been signalling to
his consort, in response to which the Hidalga had drawn steadily
forward until she was now abeam of the Milagrosa, half cableâ€™s length to
starboard, and from the height of the tall poop my lord and Miss Bishop
could see her own bustle of preparation. And they could discern signs of
it now aboard the advancing English ship as well. She was furling tops
and mainsail, stripping in fact to mizzen and sprit for the coming
action. Thus, almost silently without challenge or exchange of signals,
had action been mutually determined.
Of necessity now, under diminished sail, the advance of the Arabella was
slower; but it was none the less steady. She was already within saker
shot, and they could make out the figures stirring on her forecastle and
the brass guns gleaming on her prow. The gunners of the Milagrosa raised
their linstocks and blew upon their smouldering matches, looking up
impatiently at the Admiral.
But the Admiral solemnly shook his head.

NA
NA
 said Miss Bishop. He looked at her, and noted in her bearing only
excitement. Of fear he could still discern no trace. His lordship was
past amazement. She was not by any means the kind of woman to which life
had accustomed him.
NA
NA
NA
Under his breath Lord Julian damned the fellowâ€™s bravery.
The Arabella was advancing now along a course which, if continued, must
carry her straight between the two Spanish ships. My lord pointed
NA
death-trap. Heâ€™ll be crushed to splinters between the two. No wonder
that black-faced Don is holding his fire. In his place, I should do the

But even at that moment the Admiral raised his hand; in the waist, below
him, a trumpet blared, and immediately the gunner on the prow touched
off his guns. As the thunder of them rolled out, his lordship saw ahead
beyond the English ship and to larboard of her two heavy splashes.
Almost at once two successive spurts of flame leapt from the brass
cannon on the Arabellaâ€™s beak-head, and scarcely had the watchers on the
poop seen the shower of spray, where one of the shots struck the
water near them, then with a rending crash and a shiver that shook the
Milagrosa from stem to stern, the other came to lodge in her forecastle.
To avenge that blow, the Hidalga blazed at the Englishman with both
her forward guns. But even at that short range--between two and three
hundred yards--neither shot took effect.
At a hundred yards the Arabellaâ€™s forward guns, which had meanwhile
been reloaded, fired again at the Milagrosa, and this time smashed her
bowsprit into splinters; so that for a moment she yawed wildly to port.
Don Miguel swore profanely, and then, as the helm was put over to swing
her back to her course, his own prow replied. But the aim was too high,
and whilst one of the shots tore through the Arabellaâ€™s shrouds and
scarred her mainmast, the other again went wide. And when the smoke of
that discharge had lifted, the English ship was found almost between the
Spaniards, her bows in line with theirs and coming steadily on into what
his lordship deemed a death-trap.
Lord Julian held his breath, and Miss Bishop gasped, clutching the
rail before her. She had a glimpse of the wickedly grinning face of Don
Miguel, and the grinning faces of the men at the guns in the waist.
At last the Arabella was right between the Spanish ships prow to poop
and poop to prow. Don Miguel spoke to the trumpeter, who had mounted the
quarter-deck and stood now at the Admiralâ€™s elbow. The man raised the
silver bugle that was to give the signal for the broadsides of both
ships. But even as he placed it to his lips, the Admiral seized his arm,
to arrest him. Only then had he perceived what was so obvious--or should
have been to an experienced sea-fighter: he had delayed too long and
Captain Blood had outmanoeuvred him. In attempting to fire now upon the
Englishman, the Milagrosa and her consort would also be firing into each
other. Too late he ordered his helmsman to put the tiller hard over and
swing the ship to larboard, as a preliminary to manoeuvring for a less
impossible position of attack. At that very moment the Arabella seemed
to explode as she swept by. Eighteen guns from each of her flanks
emptied themselves at that point-blank range into the hulls of the two
Spanish vessels.
Half stunned by that reverberating thunder, and thrown off her balance
by the sudden lurch of the ship under her feet, Miss Bishop hurtled
violently against Lord Julian, who kept his feet only by clutching
the rail on which he had been leaning. Billowing clouds of smoke to
starboard blotted out everything, and its acrid odour, taking them
presently in the throat, set them gasping and coughing.
From the grim confusion and turmoil in the waist below arose a clamour
of fierce Spanish blasphemies and the screams of maimed men. The
Milagrosa staggered slowly ahead, a gaping rent in her bulwarks; her
foremast was shattered, fragments of the yards hanging in the netting
spread below. Her beak-head was in splinters, and a shot had smashed
through into the great cabin, reducing it to wreckage.
Don Miguel was bawling orders wildly, and peering ever and anon through
the curtain of smoke that was drifting slowly astern, in his anxiety to
ascertain how it might have fared with the Hidalga.
Suddenly, and ghostly at first through that lifting haze, loomed the
outline of a ship; gradually the lines of her red hull became more and
more sharply defined as she swept nearer with poles all bare save for
the spread of canvas on her sprit.
Instead of holding to her course as Don Miguel had expected she would,
the Arabella had gone about under cover of the smoke, and sailing now
in the same direction as the Milagrosa, was converging sharply upon her
across the wind, so sharply that almost before the frenzied Don Miguel
had realized the situation, his vessel staggered under the rending
impact with which the other came hurtling alongside. There was a rattle
and clank of metal as a dozen grapnels fell, and tore and caught in the
timbers of the Milagrosa, and the Spaniard was firmly gripped in the
tentacles of the English ship.
Beyond her and now well astern the veil of smoke was rent at last and
the Hidalga was revealed in desperate case. She was bilging fast, with
an ominous list to larboard, and it could be no more than a question of
moments before she settled down. The attention of her hands was being
entirely given to a desperate endeavour to launch the boats in time.
Of this Don Miguelâ€™s anguished eyes had no more than a fleeting but
comprehensive glimpse before his own decks were invaded by a wild,
yelling swarm of boarders from the grappling ship. Never was confidence
so quickly changed into despair, never was hunter more swiftly converted
into helpless prey. For helpless the Spaniards were. The swiftly
executed boarding manoeuvre had caught them almost unawares in the
moment of confusion following the punishing broadside they had sustained
at such short range. For a moment there was a valiant effort by some
of Don Miguelâ€™s officers to rally the men for a stand against these
invaders. But the Spaniards, never at their best in close-quarter
fighting, were here demoralized by knowledge of the enemies with whom
they had to deal. Their hastily formed ranks were smashed before they
could be steadied; driven across the waist to the break of the poop
on the one side, and up to the forecastle bulkheads on the other, the
fighting resolved itself into a series of skirmishes between groups. And
whilst this was doing above, another horde of buccaneers swarmed through
the hatch to the main deck below to overpower the gun-crews at their
stations there.
On the quarter deck, towards which an overwhelming wave of buccaneers
was sweeping, led by a one-eyed giant, who was naked to the waist, stood
Don Miguel, numbed by despair and rage. Above and behind him on the
poop, Lord Julian and Miss Bishop looked on, his lordship aghast at the
fury of this cooped-up fighting, the ladyâ€™s brave calm conquered at last
by horror so that she reeled there sick and faint.
Soon, however, the rage of that brief fight was spent. They saw the
banner of Castile come fluttering down from the masthead. A buccaneer
had slashed the halyard with his cutlass. The boarders were in
possession, and on the upper deck groups of disarmed Spaniards stood
huddled now like herded sheep.
Suddenly Miss Bishop recovered from her nausea, to lean forward staring
wild-eyed, whilst if possible her cheeks turned yet a deadlier hue than
they had been already.
Picking his way daintily through that shambles in the waist came a tall
man with a deeply tanned face that was shaded by a Spanish headpiece. He
was armed in back-and-breast of black steel beautifully damascened with
golden arabesques. Over this, like a stole, he wore a sling of scarlet
silk, from each end of which hung a silver-mounted pistol. Up the broad
companion to the quarter-deck he came, toying with easy assurance, until
he stood before the Spanish Admiral. Then he bowed stiff and formally.
A crisp, metallic voice, speaking perfect Spanish, reached those two
spectators on the poop, and increased the admiring wonder in which Lord
Julian had observed the manâ€™s approach.

Speechless, livid of face, his mouth distorted and his breathing
laboured, Don Miguel de Espinosa received the irony of that man to whom
he attributed his ruin and more beside. Then he uttered an inarticulate
cry of rage, and his hand swept to his sword. But even as his fingers
closed upon the hilt, the otherâ€™s closed upon his wrist to arrest the
action.

For a long moment the defeated Admiral continued to stare his hatred
in silence, then, still without speaking, he went down the companion,
staggering like a drunken man, his useless rapier clattering behind him.
His conqueror, who had not even troubled to disarm him, watched him go,
then turned and faced those two immediately above him on the poop. Lord
Julian might have observed, had he been less taken up with other things,
that the fellow seemed suddenly to stiffen, and that he turned pale
under his deep tan. A moment he stood at gaze; then suddenly and swiftly
he came up the steps. Lord Julian stood forward to meet him.

The gentleman in the black corselet appeared to become aware of his
lordship for the first time.

Apparently the announcement made no impression.

Lord Julian controlled himself to afford the desired explanation. He did

But this mannerless fellow had stepped past him, and was making a leg
to the lady, who on her side remained unresponsive and forbidding to
the point of scorn. Observing this, he turned to answer Lord Julianâ€™s
question.
NA
NA
His lips were twisted into a wry smile, and there was pain in the blue
eyes that gleamed so vividly under his black brows, pain blending with
the mockery of his voice. But of all this it was the mockery alone that
was perceived by Miss Bishop; she resented it.

But Lord Julian would not be denied. He caught him by the sleeve

dejected figure of Don Miguel.

His lordship recoiled before the furious glance that blazed at him out
of Bloodâ€™s haggard face. But the passion faded as swiftly as it had
arisen. It was in a level voice that the Captain added:

He turned slowly to depart. But again Lord Julian interposed. Containing
his indignant amazement, his lordship delivered himself coldly. â€œCaptain

CHAPTER XX. THIEF AND PIRATE
Captain Blood paced the poop of his ship alone in the tepid dusk, and
the growing golden radiance of the great poop lantern in which a seaman
had just lighted the three lamps. About him all was peace. The signs of
the dayâ€™s battle had been effaced, the decks had been swabbed, and order
was restored above and below. A group of men squatting about the main
hatch were drowsily chanting, their hardened natures softened, perhaps,
by the calm and beauty of the night. They were the men of the larboard
watch, waiting for eight bells which was imminent.
Captain Blood did not hear them; he did not hear anything save the echo
of those cruel words which had dubbed him thief and pirate.
Thief and pirate!
It is an odd fact of human nature that a man may for years possess the
knowledge that a certain thing must be of a certain fashion, and yet be
shocked to discover through his own senses that the fact is in perfect
harmony with his beliefs. When first, three years ago, at Tortuga he
had been urged upon the adventurerâ€™s course which he had followed ever
since, he had known in what opinion Arabella Bishop must hold him if
he succumbed. Only the conviction that already she was for ever lost to
him, by introducing a certain desperate recklessness into his soul had
supplied the final impulse to drive him upon his roverâ€™s course.
That he should ever meet her again had not entered his calculations, had
found no place in his dreams. They were, he conceived, irrevocably and
for ever parted. Yet, in spite of this, in spite even of the persuasion
that to her this reflection that was his torment could bring no regrets,
he had kept the thought of her ever before him in all those wild years
of filibustering. He had used it as a curb not only upon himself, but
also upon those who followed him. Never had buccaneers been so rigidly
held in hand, never had they been so firmly restrained, never so
debarred from the excesses of rapine and lust that were usual in their
kind as those who sailed with Captain Blood. It was, you will remember,
stipulated in their articles that in these as in other matters they must
submit to the commands of their leader. And because of the singular good
fortune which had attended his leadership, he had been able to impose
that stern condition of a discipline unknown before among buccaneers.
How would not these men laugh at him now if he were to tell them that
this he had done out of respect for a slip of a girl of whom he had
fallen romantically enamoured? How would not that laughter swell if he
added that this girl had that day informed him that she did not number
thieves and pirates among her acquaintance.
Thief and pirate!
How the words clung, how they stung and burnt his brain!
It did not occur to him, being no psychologist, nor learned in the
tortuous workings of the feminine mind, that the fact that she should
bestow upon him those epithets in the very moment and circumstance of
their meeting was in itself curious. He did not perceive the problem
thus presented; therefore he could not probe it. Else he might have
concluded that if in a moment in which by delivering her from captivity
he deserved her gratitude, yet she expressed herself in bitterness,
it must be because that bitterness was anterior to the gratitude and
deep-seated. She had been moved to it by hearing of the course he had
taken. Why? It was what he did not ask himself, or some ray of light
might have come to brighten his dark, his utterly evil despondency.
Surely she would never have been so moved had she not cared--had she not
felt that in what he did there was a personal wrong to herself. Surely,
he might have reasoned, nothing short of this could have moved her to
such a degree of bitterness and scorn as that which she had displayed.
That is how you will reason. Not so, however, reasoned Captain Blood.
Indeed, that night he reasoned not at all. His soul was given up to
conflict between the almost sacred love he had borne her in all these
years and the evil passion which she had now awakened in him.
Extremes touch, and in touching may for a space become confused,
indistinguishable. And the extremes of love and hate were to-night so
confused in the soul of Captain Blood that in their fusion they made up
a monstrous passion.
Thief and pirate!
That was what she deemed him, without qualification, oblivious of
the deep wrongs he had suffered, the desperate case in which he found
himself after his escape from Barbados, and all the rest that had gone
to make him what he was. That he should have conducted his filibustering
with hands as clean as were possible to a man engaged in such
undertakings had also not occurred to her as a charitable thought with
which to mitigate her judgment of a man she had once esteemed. She had
no charity for him, no mercy. She had summed him up, convicted him and
sentenced him in that one phrase. He was thief and pirate in her eyes;
nothing more, nothing less. What, then, was she? What are those who have
no charity? he asked the stars.
Well, as she had shaped him hitherto, so let her shape him now. Thief
and pirate she had branded him. She should be justified. Thief and
pirate should he prove henceforth; no more nor less; as bowelless, as
remorseless, as all those others who had deserved those names. He would
cast out the maudlin ideals by which he had sought to steer a course;
put an end to this idiotic struggle to make the best of two worlds. She
had shown him clearly to which world he belonged. Let him now justify
her. She was aboard his ship, in his power, and he desired her.
He laughed softly, jeeringly, as he leaned on the taffrail, looking down
at the phosphorescent gleam in the shipâ€™s wake, and his own laughter
startled him by its evil note. He checked suddenly, and shivered. A sob
broke from him to end that ribald burst of mirth. He took his face in
his hands and found a chill moisture on his brow.
Meanwhile, Lord Julian, who knew the feminine part of humanity rather
better than Captain Blood, was engaged in solving the curious problem
that had so completely escaped the buccaneer. He was spurred to it, I
suspect, by certain vague stirrings of jealousy. Miss Bishopâ€™s conduct
in the perils through which they had come had brought him at last
to perceive that a woman may lack the simpering graces of cultured
femininity and yet because of that lack be the more admirable. He
wondered what precisely might have been her earlier relations with
Captain Blood, and was conscious of a certain uneasiness which urged him
now to probe the matter.
His lordshipâ€™s pale, dreamy eyes had, as I have said, a habit of
observing things, and his wits were tolerably acute.
He was blaming himself now for not having observed certain things
before, or, at least, for not having studied them more closely, and he
was busily connecting them with more recent observations made that very
day.
He had observed, for instance, that Bloodâ€™s ship was named the Arabella,
and he knew that Arabella was Miss Bishopâ€™s name. And he had observed
all the odd particulars of the meeting of Captain Blood and Miss Bishop,
and the curious change that meeting had wrought in each.
The lady had been monstrously uncivil to the Captain. It was a very
foolish attitude for a lady in her circumstances to adopt towards a man
in Bloodâ€™s; and his lordship could not imagine Miss Bishop as normally
foolish. Yet, in spite of her rudeness, in spite of the fact that she
was the niece of a man whom Blood must regard as his enemy, Miss Bishop
and his lordship had been shown the utmost consideration aboard the
Captainâ€™s ship. A cabin had been placed at the disposal of each, to
which their scanty remaining belongings and Miss Bishopâ€™s woman had been
duly transferred. They were given the freedom of the great cabin, and
they had sat down to table with Pitt, the master, and Wolverstone, who
was Bloodâ€™s lieutenant, both of whom had shown them the utmost courtesy.
Also there was the fact that Blood, himself, had kept almost studiously
from intruding upon them.
His lordshipâ€™s mind went swiftly but carefully down these avenues of
thought, observing and connecting. Having exhausted them, he decided
to seek additional information from Miss Bishop. For this he must wait
until Pitt and Wolverstone should have withdrawn. He was hardly made to
wait so long, for as Pitt rose from table to follow Wolverstone, who had
already departed, Miss Bishop detained him with a question:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
She nodded. She was very calm and self-contained; but his lordship
observed that she was unusually pale, though considering what she had
that day undergone this afforded no matter for wonder.
NA
NA
NA
NA
His lordship marvelled at her memory of these names.
NA
NA
NA
There was a pause. Then, in an even quieter voice than before, Miss
Bishop asked:
NA
Pitt answered readily. There was no reason why he should not, though he
began to find the catechism intriguing.
NA
NA
Pitt hesitated. It was not a tale for a maidâ€™s ears.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Pittâ€™s eyebrows went up; still he answered.
â€œMiss dâ€™Ogeron. She was the daughter of the Governor of Tortuga. She had
gone off with this fellow Levasseur, and... and Peter delivered her out
of his dirty clutches. He was a black-hearted scoundrel, and deserved
NA
NA
NA
gossip in Tortuga which pronounced Mdlle. dâ€™Ogeron the Captainâ€™s future
wife.
Miss Bishop nodded in silence, and Jeremy Pitt turned to depart,
relieved that the catechism was ended. He paused in the doorway to
impart a piece of information.
â€œMaybe itâ€™ll comfort you to know that the Captain has altered our course
for your benefit. Itâ€™s his intention to put you both ashore on the coast
of Jamaica, as near Port Royal as we dare venture. Weâ€™ve gone about, and
NA
NA
made no shift to answer. Sombre-eyed she sat, staring into vacancy.
NA
NA
He went out, leaving his lordship pensive, those dreamy blue eyes of his
intently studying Miss Bishopâ€™s face for all their dreaminess; his mind
increasingly uneasy. At length Miss Bishop looked at him, and spoke.
NA
NA
NA
Receiving no answer, he continued to observe her silently, his long,
tapering fingers toying with a ringlet of the golden periwig in which
his long face was set.
Miss Bishop sat bemused, her brows knit, her brooding glance seeming
to study the fine Spanish point that edged the tablecloth. At last his
lordship broke the silence.
NA
seemed to change its level. â€œThat he should alter his course for us
is in itself matter for wonder; but that he should take a risk on our
behalf--that he should venture into Jamaica waters.... It amazes me, as
NA
Miss Bishop raised her eyes, and looked at him. She appeared to be very
thoughtful. Then her lip flickered curiously, almost scornfully, it
seemed to him. Her slender fingers drummed the table.
NA
she at last.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œDo you? Stab me! I shouldnâ€™t boast of it. It argues either extreme
NA
Lord Sunderlandâ€™s school of philosophy. He added after a moment: â€œSo
NA
A faint colour stirred in her cheeks. â€œYour lordship is evidently
aggrieved with me. I am disconsolate. I hope your lordshipâ€™s grievance
is sounder than your views of life. It is news to me that ingratitude is
NA
NA
the tartness she had used. â€œIf you would do me the honour to listen,
you would not misapprehend me. For if unlike you I do not always say
precisely what I think, at least I say precisely what I wish to convey.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
His lordship permitted himself the slightest gesture of impatience.
NA
you have done in these savage places of the world, you can hardly fail
to be aware of what is known even in England: that this fellow Blood
strictly confines himself to making war upon the Spaniards. So that to
call him thief and pirate as you did was to overstate the case against
him at a time when it would have been more prudent to have understated
NA
NA
â€œNothing--as I perceive. But, at least, study generosity. I tell you
frankly, maâ€™am, that in Bloodâ€™s place I should never have been so nice.
Sink me! When you consider what he has suffered at the hands of his
fellow-countrymen, you may marvel with me that he should trouble to

NA
NA
NA
 Miss Bishopâ€™s scorn was almost fierce.
His lordship stared at her again. Then he half-closed his large, pale

said softly.
He saw the sudden scarlet flame upon her cheeks, the heavy frown that
descended upon her brow. He had made her very angry, he judged. But
there was no explosion. She recovered.
NA
NA
worth regarding. Heâ€™d be an acquisition to the Kingâ€™s navy--a man that
can do the things he did this morning. His service under de Ruyter
wasnâ€™t wasted on him. That was a great seaman, and--blister me!--the
pupilâ€™s worthy the master if I am a judge of anything. I doubt if the
Royal Navy can show his equal. To thrust himself deliberately between
those two, at point-blank range, and so turn the tables on them! It asks
courage, resource, and invention. And we land-lubbers were not the only
ones he tricked by his manoeuvre. That Spanish Admiral never guessed the
intent until it was too late and Blood held him in check. A great man,

Miss Bishop was moved to sarcasm.
â€œYou should use your influence with my Lord Sunderland to have the King

His lordship laughed softly. â€œFaith, itâ€™s done already. I have his
NA
exposition of the circumstances. In that amazement he left her, and went
in quest of Blood. But he was still intrigued. If she were a little less
uncompromising in her attitude towards Blood, his lordship would have
been happier.
He found the Captain pacing the quarter-deck, a man mentally exhausted
from wrestling with the Devil, although of this particular occupation
his lordship could have no possible suspicion. With the amiable
familiarity he used, Lord Julian slipped an arm through one of the
Captainâ€™s, and fell into step beside him.
NA
lordship was not disturbed.

Lord Julian ignored the obvious sarcasm.
â€œItâ€™s an odd coincidence that we should have been brought together in
this fashion, considering that I came out to the Indies especially to

When he had done, Captain Blood, who until that moment had stood
still under the spell of his astonishment, disengaged his arm from his
lordshipâ€™s, and stood squarely before him.

though I may be. So Iâ€™ll not be telling you what I think of you for
daring to bring me this offer, or of my Lord Sunderland--since heâ€™s your
kinsman for having the impudence to send it. But it does not surprise me
at all that one who is a minister of James Stuartâ€™s should conceive
that every man is to be seduced by bribes into betraying those who trust

â€œAnd dâ€™ ye think theyâ€™ll go with me to hunt their brethren--the
Brethren of the Coast? On my soul, Lord Julian, it is yourself does the
misapprehending. Are there not even notions of honour left in England?
Oh, and thereâ€™s more to it than that, even. Dâ€™ye think I could take a
commission of King Jamesâ€™s? I tell you I wouldnâ€™t be soiling my hands
with it--thief and pirateâ€™s hands though they be. Thief and pirate is
what you heard Miss Bishop call me to-day--a thing of scorn, an outcast.
NA
NA
â€œYe must know that I was no such thing--no rebel at all. It wasnâ€™t even
pretended. If it were, I could forgive them. But not even that cloak
could they cast upon their foulness. Oh, no; there was no mistake. I
was convicted for what I did, neither more nor less. That bloody vampire
Jeffreys--bad cess to him!--sentenced me to death, and his worthy master
James Stuart afterwards sent me into slavery, because I had performed an
act of mercy; because compassionately and without thought for creed or
politics I had sought to relieve the sufferings of a fellow-creature;
because I had dressed the wounds of a man who was convicted of treason.
That was all my offence. Youâ€™ll find it in the records. And for that I
was sold into slavery: because by the law of England, as administered by
James Stuart in violation of the laws of God, who harbours or comforts
a rebel is himself adjudged guilty of rebellion. Dâ€™ye dream man, what it

He checked suddenly at the very height of his passion. A moment he
paused, then cast it from him as if it had been a cloak. His voice sank
again. He uttered a little laugh of weariness and contempt.
â€œBut there! I grow hot for nothing at all. I explain myself, I think,
and God knows, it is not my custom. I am grateful to you, Lord Julian,
for your kindly intentions. I am so. But yeâ€™ll understand, perhaps. Ye

Lord Julian stood still. He was deeply stricken by the otherâ€™s words,
the passionate, eloquent outburst that in a few sharp, clear-cut strokes
had so convincingly presented the manâ€™s bitter case against humanity,
his complete apologia and justification for all that could be laid to
his charge. His lordship looked at that keen, intrepid face gleaming
lividly in the light of the great poop lantern, and his own eyes were
troubled. He was abashed.

NA
mirth, and, disregarding the proffered hand, swung on his heel.
Lord Julian stood a moment, watching the tall figure as it moved away
towards the taffrail. Then letting his arms fall helplessly to his sides
in dejection, he departed.
Just within the doorway of the alley leading to the cabin, he ran into
Miss Bishop. Yet she had not been coming out, for her back was towards
him, and she was moving in the same direction. He followed her, his mind
too full of Captain Blood to be concerned just then with her movements.
In the cabin he flung into a chair, and exploded, with a violence
altogether foreign to his nature.
â€œDamme if ever I met a man I liked better, or even a man I liked as

kept her eyes upon her folded hands.
He looked up in surprise, and then sat conning her with brooding glance.

CHAPTER XXI. THE SERVICE OF KING JAMES
Miss Arabella Bishop was aroused very early on the following morning by
the brazen voice of a bugle and the insistent clanging of a bell in the
shipâ€™s belfry. As she lay awake, idly watching the rippled green water
that appeared to be streaming past the heavily glazed porthole, she
became gradually aware of the sounds of swift, laboured bustle--the
clatter of many feet, the shouts of hoarse voices, and the persistent
trundlings of heavy bodies in the ward-room immediately below the deck
of the cabin. Conceiving these sounds to portend a more than normal
activity, she sat up, pervaded by a vague alarm, and roused her still
slumbering woman.
In his cabin on the starboard side Lord Julian, disturbed by the same
sounds, was already astir and hurriedly dressing. When presently he
emerged under the break of the poop, he found himself staring up into
a mountain of canvas. Every foot of sail that she could carry had been
crowded to the Arabellaâ€™s yards, to catch the morning breeze. Ahead
and on either side stretched the limitless expanse of ocean, sparkling
golden in the sun, as yet no more than a half-disc of flame upon the
horizon straight ahead.
About him in the waist, where all last night had been so peaceful, there
was a frenziedly active bustle of some threescore men. By the rail,
immediately above and behind Lord Julian, stood Captain Blood in
altercation with a one-eyed giant, whose head was swathed in a red
cotton kerchief, whose blue shirt hung open at the waist. As his
lordship, moving forward, revealed himself, their voices ceased, and
Blood turned to greet him.
NA
have. I should have known better than to come so close to Jamaica by
night. But I was in haste to land you. Come up here. I have something to

Wondering, Lord Julian mounted the companion as he was bidden. Standing
beside Captain Blood, he looked astern, following the indication of the
Captainâ€™s hand, and cried out in his amazement. There, not more than
three miles away, was land--an uneven wall of vivid green that filled
the western horizon. And a couple of miles this side of it, bearing
after them, came speeding three great white ships.
NA
spoke without excitement, almost with a certain listlessness. â€œWhen dawn
broke we found ourselves running to meet them. We went about, and itâ€™s
been a race ever since. But the Arabella â€˜s been at sea these four
NA
Wolverstone hooked his thumbs into his broad leather belt, and from his
great height looked down sardonically upon Lord Julian, tall man though
his lordship was. â€œSo that youâ€™re like to be in yet another sea-fight

NA

to odds. The odds was heavier at Maracaybo; yet we won out, and took

â€œAnd what better are these?--Are ye afeard of a lubberly Barbados

A gun boomed out behind them.

voice; and he fetched a sigh.
Wolverstone squared himself defiantly before his captain
NA
spat, presumably for purposes of emphasis.
His lordship intervened.
â€œOh, but--by your leave--surely there is nothing to be apprehended from
Colonel Bishop. Considering the service you have rendered to his niece
NA
NA
mocked. â€œYe donâ€™t know Colonel Bishop, thatâ€™s clear. Not for his niece,
not for his daughter, not for his own mother, would he forgo the blood
what he thinks due to him. A drinker of blood, he is. A nasty beast. We
NA
NA
Wolverstone laughed again, whereat his lordship flushed. He was moved to
raise his voice above its usual languid level.
NA
NA
Came the roar of a second gun, and a round shot splashed the water less
than half a cableâ€™s-length astern. Blood leaned over the rail to speak
to the fair young man immediately below him by the helmsman at the
whipstaff.
NA
But Wolverstone interposed again.
NA
the Captain, who had placed a hand on is shoulder and was smiling, a
trifle wistfully.
NA
â€œSteady, yourself, Peter. Yeâ€™ve gone mad! Will ye doom us all to hell
NA
NA
But Wolverstone would not stop. â€œItâ€™s the truth, you fool. Itâ€™s that
cursed petticoatâ€™s making a coward of you. Itâ€™s for her that yeâ€™re
afeard--and she, Colonel Bishopâ€™s niece! My God, man, yeâ€™ll have a
mutiny aboard, and Iâ€™ll lead it myself sooner than surrender to be

Their glances met, sullen defiance braving dull anger, surprise, and
pain.
NA
save only myself. If Bishop can report to England that I am taken
and hanged, he will magnify himself and at the same time gratify his
personal rancour against me. That should satisfy him. Iâ€™ll send him a
message offering to surrender aboard his ship, taking Miss Bishop and
Lord Julian with me, but only on condition that the Arabella is allowed
to proceed unharmed. Itâ€™s a bargain that heâ€™ll accept, if I know him at

NA
earlier vehemence was as nothing to his vehemence now. â€œYeâ€™re surely
NA
NA
as he spoke to indicate the pursuing ships, which were slowly but surely
creeping nearer. â€œBefore weâ€™ve run another half-mile we shall be within
NA
Wolverstone swore elaborately, then suddenly checked. Out of the tail
of his single eye he had espied a trim figure in grey silk that was
ascending the companion. So engrossed had they been that they had not
seen Miss Bishop come from the door of the passage leading to the cabin.
And there was something else that those three men on the poop, and Pitt
immediately below them, had failed to observe. Some moments ago Ogle,
followed by the main body of his gun-deck crew, had emerged from the
booby hatch, to fall into muttered, angrily vehement talk with those
who, abandoning the gun-tackles upon which they were labouring, had come
to crowd about him.
Even now Blood had no eyes for that. He turned to look at Miss Bishop,
marvelling a little, after the manner in which yesterday she had avoided
him, that she should now venture upon the quarter-deck. Her presence
at this moment, and considering the nature of his altercation with
Wolverstone, was embarrassing.
Very sweet and dainty she stood before him in her gown of shimmering
grey, a faint excitement tinting her fair cheeks and sparkling in her
clear, hazel eyes, that looked so frank and honest. She wore no hat,
and the ringlets of her gold-brown hair fluttered distractingly in the
morning breeze.
Captain Blood bared his head and bowed silently in a greeting which she
returned composedly and formally.
NA
As if to answer her a third gun spoke from the ships towards which she
was looking intent and wonderingly. A frown rumpled her brow. She looked
from one to the other of the men who stood there so glum and obviously
ill at ease.
NA
It should in any case have been a sufficient explanation. But before
more could be added, their attention was drawn at last to Ogle, who came
bounding up the broad ladder, and to the men lounging aft in his wake,
in all of which, instinctively, they apprehended a vague menace.
At the head of the companion, Ogle found his progress barred by Blood,
who confronted him, a sudden sternness in his face and in every line of
him.
NA
NA
Thus challenged, the obvious truculence faded out of Ogleâ€™s bearing,
quenched by the old habit of obedience and the natural dominance that
was the secret of the Captainâ€™s rule over his wild followers. But it
gave no pause to the gunnerâ€™s intention. If anything it increased his
excitement.
NA
NA
Bloodâ€™s height seemed to increase, as did his sternness.
NA
the gun-deck. Youâ€™ll return to it at once, and take your crew with you,
NA
But Ogle, violent of mien and gesture, interrupted him.
NA
NA
It was the first time in his buccaneering career that an order of his
had been disregarded, or that a man had failed in the obedience to which
he pledged all those who joined him. That this insubordination should
proceed from one of those whom he most trusted, one of his old Barbados
associates, was in itself a bitterness, and made him reluctant to that
which instinct told him must be done. His hand closed over the butt of
one of the pistols slung before him.

NA
From the three or four score men massed below in the waist came a rumble
of approval. Captain Bloodâ€™s glance raked the ranks of those resolute,
fierce-eyed fellows, then it came to rest again on Ogle. There was here
quite plainly a vague threat, a mutinous spirit he could not understand.

elaborated that affirmation.
In a flash Captain Blood saw what was in their minds. And for all that
he lost nothing of his outward stern composure, fear invaded his heart.
NA
NA
â€œItâ€™s a providence having her aboard; a providence. Heave to, Captain,
and signal them to send a boat, and assure themselves that Miss is here.
Then let them know that if they attempt to hinder our sailing hence,
weâ€™ll hang the doxy first and fight for it after. Thatâ€™ll cool Colonel

answer the otherâ€™s confident excitement, and as he spoke he advanced
to Bloodâ€™s side, an unexpected ally. â€œSome oâ€™ them dawcocks may believe

whose ranks were steadily being increased by the advent of others from
the forecastle. â€œAlthough even some oâ€™ they should know better, for
thereâ€™s still a few was on Barbados with us, and are acquainted like
me and you with Colonel Bishop. If yeâ€™re counting on pulling Bishopâ€™s
heartstrings, yeâ€™re a bigger fool, Ogle, than Iâ€™ve always thought you
was with anything but guns. Thereâ€™s no heaving to for such a matter as
that unless you wants to make quite sure of our being sunk. Though we
had a cargo of Bishopâ€™s nieces it wouldnâ€™t make him hold his hand.
Why, as I was just telling his lordship here, who thought like you that
having Miss Bishop aboard would make us safe, not for his mother would
that filthy slaver forgo whatâ€™s due to him. And if yeâ€™ werenâ€™t a fool,
Ogle, you wouldnâ€™t need me to tell you this. Weâ€™ve got to fight, my
NA
NA
conviction which Wolverstoneâ€™s argument was imposing upon his listeners.
â€œYou may be right, and you may be wrong. Weâ€™ve got to chance it. Itâ€™s

The rest of his words were drowned in the shouts of the hands insisting
that the girl be given up to be held as a hostage. And then louder than
before roared a gun away to leeward, and away on their starboard beam
they saw the spray flung up by the shot, which had gone wide.
NA
NA
Pitt, at his post beside the helmsman, turned intrepidly to face the
excited gunner.
â€œSince when have you commanded on the main deck, Ogle? I take my orders
NA
NA
NA
NA
He looked over his shoulder, aft, at the advancing ships, the foremost
of which was now a bare quarter of a mile away. His glance swept in
passing over Miss Bishop and Lord Julian standing side by side some
paces behind him. He observed her pale and tense, with parted lips
and startled eyes that were fixed upon him, an anxious witness of this
deciding of her fate. He was thinking swiftly, reckoning the chances
if by pistolling Ogle he were to provoke a mutiny. That some of the men
would rally to him, he was sure. But he was no less sure that the main
body would oppose him, and prevail in spite of all that he could do,
taking the chance that holding Miss Bishop to ransom seemed to afford
them. And if they did that, one way or the other, Miss Bishop would be
lost. For even if Bishop yielded to their demand, they would retain her
as a hostage.
Meanwhile Ogle was growing impatient. His arm still gripped by Blood, he
thrust his face into the Captainâ€™s.

The better way that was in Captain Bloodâ€™s mind was the way that already
he had proposed to Wolverstone. Whether the men in the panic Ogle had
aroused among them would take a different view from Wolverstoneâ€™s he
did not know. But he saw quite clearly now that if they consented, they
would not on that account depart from their intention in the matter
of Miss Bishop; they would make of Bloodâ€™s own surrender merely an
additional card in this game against the Governor of Jamaica.
NA

our lives, and weâ€™re not going to lose our lives as long as thereâ€™s a

He was turning again to the helmsman below, when Bloodâ€™s grip tightened
on his arm. Ogle wrenched it free, with an oath. But Bloodâ€™s mind was
now made up. He had found the only way, and repellent though it might be
to him, he must take it.
NA
NA
NA
A silence of astonishment fell upon the ship--of astonishment and
suspicion at this sudden yielding. But Pitt, although he shared it, was
prompt to obey. His voice rang out, giving the necessary orders, and
after an instantâ€™s pause, a score of hands sprang to execute them.
Came the creak of blocks and the rattle of slatting sails as they swung
aweather, and Captain Blood turned and beckoned Lord Julian forward.
His lordship, after a momentâ€™s hesitation, advanced in surprise and
mistrust--a mistrust shared by Miss Bishop, who, like his lordship and
all else aboard, though in a different way, had been taken aback by
Bloodâ€™s sudden submission to the demand to lie to.
Standing now at the rail, with Lord Julian beside him, Captain Blood
explained himself.
Briefly and clearly he announced to all the object of Lord Julianâ€™s
voyage to the Caribbean, and he informed them of the offer which
yesterday Lord Julian had made to him.
â€œThat offer I rejected, as his lordship will tell you, deeming myself
affronted by it. Those of you who have suffered under the rule of King
James will understand me. But now in the desperate case in which we find
ourselves--outsailed, and likely to be outfought, as Ogle has said--I
am ready to take the way of Morgan: to accept the Kingâ€™s commission and

It was a thunderbolt that for a moment left them all dazed. Then Babel
was reenacted. The main body of them welcomed the announcement as only
men who have been preparing to die can welcome a new lease of life. But
many could not resolve one way or the other until they were satisfied
upon several questions, and chiefly upon one which was voiced by Ogle.
NA
It was Lord Julian who answered:
â€œIt will go very hard with him if he attempts to flout the Kingâ€™s
authority. And though he should dare attempt it, be sure that his own

NA
But there were some who were still in open and frank revolt against the
course. Of these was Wolverstone, who at once proclaimed his hostility.
NA
But Blood quieted him and those who thought as he did.
â€œNo man need follow me into the Kingâ€™s service who is reluctant. That is
not in the bargain. What is in the bargain is that I accept this service
with such of you as may choose to follow me. Donâ€™t think I accept it
willingly. For myself, I am entirely of Wolverstoneâ€™s opinion. I accept
it as the only way to save us all from the certain destruction into
which my own act may have brought us. And even those of you who do
not choose to follow me shall share the immunity of all, and shall
afterwards be free to depart. Those are the terms upon which I sell
myself to the King. Let Lord Julian, the representative of the Secretary

Prompt, eager, and clear came his lordshipâ€™s agreement. And that
was practically the end of the matter. Lord Julian, the butt now of
good-humouredly ribald jests and half-derisive acclamations, plunged
away to his cabin for the commission, secretly rejoicing at a turn of
events which enabled him so creditably to discharge the business on
which he had been sent.
Meanwhile the boâ€™sun signalled to the Jamaica ships to send a boat, and
the men in the waist broke their ranks and went noisily flocking to line
the bulwarks and view the great stately vessels that were racing down
towards them.
As Ogle left the quarter-deck, Blood turned, and came face to face with
Miss Bishop. She had been observing him with shining eyes, but at sight
of his dejected countenance, and the deep frown that scarred his
brow, her own expression changed. She approached him with a hesitation
entirely unusual to her. She set a hand lightly upon his arm.
NA

He looked with gloomy eyes upon her for whom he had made this sacrifice.

Looking beyond her, across the water, he observed a boat putting off
from one of the great ships, which, hove to now, were rocking gently
some three hundred yards away. Abruptly his manner changed. He was like
one recovering, taking himself in hand again. â€œIf you will go below, and
get your gear and your woman, you shall presently be sent aboard one of

This deputy proved to be an officer named Calverley, a vigorous,
self-sufficient fellow, comparatively fresh from England, whose manner
made it clear that he came fully instructed by Colonel Bishop upon the
matter of how to handle the pirates.
His air, as he stepped into the waist of the Arabella, was haughty,
truculent, and disdainful.
Blood, the Kingâ€™s commission now in his pocket, and Lord Julian standing
beside him, waited to receive him, and Captain Calverley was a little
taken aback at finding himself confronted by two men so very different
outwardly from anything that he had expected. But he lost none of his
haughty poise, and scarcely deigned a glance at the swarm of fierce,
half-naked fellows lounging in a semicircle to form a background.

Captain Calverley stared hard. The airy manner of this redoubtable
buccaneer was hardly what he had looked for in a desperate fellow,
compelled to ignominious surrender. A thin, sour smile broke on the
officerâ€™s haughty lips.

â€œI suppose that is after the fashion of your kind. Meanwhile itâ€™s your

Captain Blood appeared surprised, pained. He turned in appeal to Lord
Julian.

ye? Ye see, the young gentlemanâ€™s under a misapprehension entirely.
Perhaps itâ€™ll save broken bones if your lordship explains just who and

Lord Julian advanced a step and bowed perfunctorily and rather
disdainfully to that very disdainful but now dumbfounded officer. Pitt,
who watched the scene from the quarter-deck rail, tells us that his
lordship was as grave as a parson at a hanging. But I suspect this
gravity for a mask under which Lord Julian was secretly amused.

Captain Calverleyâ€™s face empurpled; his eyes bulged. The buccaneers in
the background chuckled and crowed and swore among themselves in their
relish of this comedy. For a long moment Calverley stared in silence
at his lordship, observing the costly elegance of his dress, his air of
calm assurance, and his cold, fastidious speech, all of which savoured
distinctly of the great world to which he belonged.

Colder still and more distant than ever grew his lordshipâ€™s voice.

Captain Blood thrust a parchment under Calverleyâ€™s bulging eyes. The

back, a baffled, impotent man. He bowed helplessly.

At that moment a lane was opened in the ranks of the men, and through
this came Miss Bishop followed by her octoroon woman. Over his shoulder
Captain Blood observed her approach.

CHAPTER XXII. HOSTILITIES
In the great harbour of Port Royal, spacious enough to have given
moorings to all the ships of all the navies of the world, the Arabella
rode at anchor. Almost she had the air of a prisoner, for a quarter of a
mile ahead, to starboard, rose the lofty, massive single round tower
of the fort, whilst a couple of cablesâ€™-length astern, and to larboard,
rode the six men-of-war that composed the Jamaica squadron.
Abeam with the Arabella, across the harbour, were the flat-fronted white
buildings of that imposing city that came down to the very waterâ€™s edge.
Behind these the red roofs rose like terraces, marking the gentle slope
upon which the city was built, dominated here by a turret, there by a
spire, and behind these again a range of green hills with for ultimate
background a sky that was like a dome of polished steel.
On a cane day-bed that had been set for him on the quarter-deck,
sheltered from the dazzling, blistering sunshine by an improvised awning
of brown sailcloth, lounged Peter Blood, a calf-bound, well-thumbed copy
of Horaceâ€™s Odes neglected in his hands.
From immediately below him came the swish of mops and the gurgle of
water in the scuppers, for it was still early morning, and under the
directions of Hayton, the boâ€™sun, the swabbers were at work in the
waist and forecastle. Despite the heat and the stagnant air, one of the
toilers found breath to croak a ribald buccaneering ditty:
  â€œFor we laid her board and board,
   And we put her to the sword,
   And we sank her in the deep blue sea.
   So Itâ€™s heigh-ho, and heave-a-ho!
NA
Blood fetched a sigh, and the ghost of a smile played over his lean,
sun-tanned face. Then the black brows came together above the vivid
blue eyes, and thought swiftly closed the door upon his immediate
surroundings.
Things had not sped at all well with him in the past fortnight since his
acceptance of the Kingâ€™s commission. There had been trouble with Bishop
from the moment of landing. As Blood and Lord Julian had stepped ashore
together, they had been met by a man who took no pains to dissemble his
chagrin at the turn of events and his determination to change it. He
awaited them on the mole, supported by a group of officers.

For Blood at the moment he had nothing beyond a malignant glance.
Lord Julian bowed. â€œI take it I have the honour to address Colonel

and belatedly bowed, removing his broad hat. Then he plunged on.

NA
Blood would have intervened at that, but Lord Julian forestalled him.
â€œI see, sir, that you do not yet quite apprehend the circumstances. If
it is a mistake to grant Captain Blood a commission, the mistake is not
mine. I am acting upon the instructions of my Lord Sunderland; and with
a full knowledge of all the facts, his lordship expressly designated
Captain Blood for this commission if Captain Blood could be persuaded to

Colonel Bishopâ€™s mouth fell open in surprise and dismay.
NA
NA
His lordship waited a moment for a reply. None coming from the
speechless Deputy-Governor, he asked a question: â€œWould you still
venture to describe the matter as a mistake, sir? And dare you take the
NA
NA
NA
Perforce Bishop must put on the best face he could command. But that it
was no more than a mask for his fury and his venom was plain to all.
From that unpromising beginning matters had not improved; rather had
they grown worse.
Bloodâ€™s thoughts were upon this and other things as he lounged there on
the day-bed. He had been a fortnight in Port Royal, his ship virtually
a unit now in the Jamaica squadron. And when the news of it reached
Tortuga and the buccaneers who awaited his return, the name of Captain
Blood, which had stood so high among the Brethren of the Coast, would
become a byword, a thing of execration, and before all was done his life
might pay forfeit for what would be accounted a treacherous defection.
And for what had he placed himself in this position? For the sake of
a girl who avoided him so persistently and intentionally that he must
assume that she still regarded him with aversion. He had scarcely been
vouchsafed a glimpse of her in all this fortnight, although with that in
view for his main object he had daily haunted her uncleâ€™s residence, and
daily braved the unmasked hostility and baffled rancour in which Colonel
Bishop held him. Nor was that the worst of it. He was allowed plainly
to perceive that it was the graceful, elegant young trifler from St.
Jamesâ€™s, Lord Julian Wade, to whom her every moment was devoted. And
what chance had he, a desperate adventurer with a record of outlawry,
against such a rival as that, a man of parts, moreover, as he was bound
to admit?
You conceive the bitterness of his soul. He beheld himself to be as the
dog in the fable that had dropped the substance to snatch at a delusive
shadow.
He sought comfort in a line on the open page before him:
NA
Sought it, but hardly found it.
A boat that had approached unnoticed from the shore came scraping and
bumping against the great red hull of the Arabella, and a raucous voice
sent up a hailing shout. From the shipâ€™s belfry two silvery notes rang
clear and sharp, and a moment or two later the boâ€™sunâ€™s whistle shrilled
a long wail.
The sounds disturbed Captain Blood from his disgruntled musings. He
rose, tall, active, and arrestingly elegant in a scarlet, gold-laced
coat that advertised his new position, and slipping the slender volume
into his pocket, advanced to the carved rail of the quarter-deck, just
as Jeremy Pitt was setting foot upon the companion.
NA
he proffered a folded sheet.
Blood broke the seal, and read. Pitt, loosely clad in shirt and
breeches, leaned against the rail the while and watched him,
unmistakable concern imprinted on his fair, frank countenance.
Blood uttered a short laugh, and curled his lip. â€œIt is a very

The young masterâ€™s grey eyes skimmed it. Thoughtfully he stroked his
golden beard.
NA
NA
â€œBut itâ€™ll be about the Old Wolf that he wants to see you. It gives him
a grievance at last. You know, Peter, that it is Lord Julian alone has

lad, the Arabellaâ€™s a prisoner here, bedad, â€˜twixt the fort there and

Jeremy clenched his hands. â€œWhy did ye let Wolverstone and the others

NA
â€œHow could I in honesty have detained them? It was in the bargain.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, well, maybe heâ€™ll not find me quite so easy to grasp as he
NA
departed to his cabin.
Jeremy Pitt answered the laugh with an oath. A moment he stood
irresolute where Blood had left him. Then slowly, reluctance dragging
at his feet, he went down the companion to give the order for the
cock-boat.
NA
over the side, â€œColonel Bishop had better look to himself. These fifty
lads may be lukewarm at present, as you say, but--sink me!--theyâ€™ll be
NA
â€œAnd what should be happening to me, Jeremy? Sure, now, Iâ€™ll be back for
NA
Blood climbed down into the waiting boat. But laugh though he might, he
knew as well as Pitt that in going ashore that morning he carried
his life in his hands. Because of this, it may have been that when he
stepped on to the narrow mole, in the shadow of the shallow outer wall
of the fort through whose crenels were thrust the black noses of its
heavy guns, he gave order that the boat should stay for him at that
spot. He realized that he might have to retreat in a hurry.
Walking leisurely, he skirted the embattled wall, and passed through the
great gates into the courtyard. Half-a-dozen soldiers lounged there,
and in the shadow cast by the wall, Major Mallard, the Commandant, was
slowly pacing. He stopped short at sight of Captain Blood, and saluted
him, as was his due, but the smile that lifted the officerâ€™s stiff
mostachios was grimly sardonic. Peter Bloodâ€™s attention, however, was
elsewhere.
On his right stretched a spacious garden, beyond which rose the white
house that was the residence of the Deputy-Governor. In that gardenâ€™s
main avenue, that was fringed with palm and sandalwood, he had caught
sight of Miss Bishop alone. He crossed the courtyard with suddenly
lengthened stride.

lips smiled, his blue eyes were oddly hard.

instincts to avoid an engagement.

Fearing to betray the latter, she took refuge in the former. â€œI do my

be, now, I should be thankful for so much. Maybe Iâ€™m presumptuous. But
I canâ€™t forget that when I was no better than a slave in your uncleâ€™s

â€œWhy not? In those days you had some claim upon my kindness. You were

She spoke hastily, the thought of Mademoiselle dâ€™Ogeron in her mind.
And instantly would have recalled the words had she been able. But Peter
Blood swept them lightly aside, reading into them none of her meaning,
as she feared he would.
NA
NA
 she discouraged him.
NA
NA
This was a disarming stroke. He abandoned combat for expostulation.
â€œCan ye say that now? Can ye say that, beholding me in this livery of a
service I despise? Didnâ€™t ye tell me that I might redeem the past? Itâ€™s
little enough I am concerned to redeem the past save only in your eyes.

A livelier colour crept into her cheeks. There was a perceptible heave
of the slight breast that faintly swelled the flimsy bodice of white
silk. But if she resented his tone and his words, she stifled her
resentment. She realized that perhaps she had, herself, provoked his
anger. She honestly desired to make amends.
NA
But they were fated to misunderstand each other.
Jealousy, that troubler of reason, had been over-busy with his wits as
it had with hers.
NA
She started, and stared at him blankly indignant now.
NA
NA
For a moment she stood before him with quickened breathing, the colour
ebbing and flowing in her cheeks. Then she looked past him, and tilted
her chin forward.
NA
NA
He stepped aside, and with the broad feathered hat which he still held
in his hand, he waved her on towards the house.
â€œIâ€™ll not be detaining you any longer, maâ€™am. After all, the cursed
thing I did for nothing can be undone. Yeâ€™ll remember afterwards that it

He clapped his hat on his head with a certain abrupt fierceness, and
strode angrily away, before she could answer or even grasp the full
significance of what he had said.
CHAPTER XXIII. HOSTAGES
Peter Blood stood in the pillared portico of Government House, and with
unseeing eyes that were laden with pain and anger, stared out across the
great harbour of Port Royal to the green hills rising from the farther
shore and the ridge of the Blue Mountains beyond, showing hazily through
the quivering heat.
He was aroused by the return of the negro who had gone to announce him,
and following now this slave, he made his way through the house to the
wide piazza behind it, in whose shade Colonel Bishop and my Lord Julian
Wade took what little air there was.
NA
greeting by a series of grunts of vague but apparently ill-humoured
import.
He did not trouble to rise, not even when Lord Julian, obeying the
instincts of finer breeding, set him the example. From under scowling
brows the wealthy Barbados planter considered his sometime slave, who,
hat in hand, leaning lightly upon his long beribboned cane, revealed
nothing in his countenance of the anger which was being steadily
nourished by this cavalier reception.
At last, with scowling brow and in self-sufficient tones, Colonel Bishop
delivered himself.
â€œI have sent for you, Captain Blood, because of certain news that has
just reached me. I am informed that yesterday evening a frigate left the
harbour having on board your associate Wolverstone and a hundred men of
the hundred and fifty that were serving under you. His lordship and I
shall be glad to have your explanation of how you came to permit that

The answer left Bishop speechless for a moment. Then:
NA
raised his eyebrows. â€œâ€˜Swounds! Perhaps youâ€™ll explain yourself? Whither
NA
â€œTo Tortuga. Heâ€™s gone with a message to the officers commanding the
other four ships of the fleet that is awaiting me there, telling them

Bishopâ€™s great face seemed to swell and its high colour to deepen. He
swung to Lord Julian.
â€œYou hear that, my lord? Deliberately he has let Wolverstone loose upon
the seas again--Wolverstone, the worst of all that gang of pirates after
himself. I hope your lordship begins at last to perceive the folly of
granting the Kingâ€™s commission to such a man as this against all my
counsels. Why, this thing is... itâ€™s just mutiny... treason! By God!
NA
NA
 Blood put on his hat, and sat down unbidden. â€œI have sent Wolverstone
to inform Hagthorpe and Christian and Yberville and the rest of my lads
that theyâ€™ve one clear month in which to follow my example, quit piracy,
and get back to their boucans or their logwood, or else sail out of the

And then the Deputy-Governor exploded.

NA

Lord Julian forestalled a fresh outburst on the part of Bishop.

NA
It was a courteous, conciliatory speech. Urged by friendliness towards
Blood and understanding of the difficult position in which the buccaneer
found himself, his lordship was disposed to take his stand upon the
letter of his instructions. Therefore he now held out a friendly hand to
help him over the latest and most difficult obstacle which Blood himself
had enabled Bishop to place in the way of his redemption. Unfortunately
the last person from whom Peter Blood desired assistance at that moment
was this young nobleman, whom he regarded with the jaundiced eyes of
jealousy.
NA
suggestion of a sneer, â€œitâ€™s the most ye should expect from me, and
NA
His lordship frowned, and dabbed his lips with a handkerchief.
â€œI donâ€™t think that I quite like the way you put it. Indeed, upon

His lordshipâ€™s pale eyes opened a little wider. Languidly he raised his
eyebrows.

 said Blood to his lordship, â€œwas the one that trade this greasy slaver
Deputy-Governor of Jamaica instead of its hangman, which is the office
NA
NA
NA
But here Bishop interrupted him. He had heaved himself to his feet, at
last, and was venting his fury in unprintable abuse. Captain Blood,
who had also risen, stood apparently impassive, for the storm to spend
itself. When at last this happened, he addressed himself quietly to Lord
Julian, as if Colonel Bishop had not spoken.
NA
But his lordship had by now recovered his habitual composure, and was
again disposed to be conciliatory. He laughed and shrugged.
NA
plaguey climate provides enough of that. Perhaps, Colonel Bishop, you
are a little uncompromising; and you, sir, are certainly a deal too
peppery. I have said, speaking on behalf of my Lord Sunderland, that I

But Bishopâ€™s fury had by now reached a stage in which it was not to be
restrained.
NA
which your lordship must allow me to be the better judge. And, anyhow,
NA
Lord Julian abandoned the struggle. He smiled wearily, shrugged, and
waved a hand in implied resignation. The Deputy-Governor stormed on.
â€œSince my lord here has given you a commission, I canâ€™t regularly deal
with you out of hand for piracy as you deserve. But you shall answer
before a court-martial for your action in the matter of Wolverstone, and
NA
NA
Deputy-Governor will preside over that same court-martial. So that ye
can wipe off old scores by hanging me, itâ€™s little ye care how ye do

He was at pains, you see, to be provocative.

NA
Iâ€™ll tell you that the Harbour-Master and the Commandant have their
orders. You donâ€™t leave Port Royal, my fine gallows bird. Damme, I mean
NA
Peter Blood stiffened, and his vivid blue eyes stabbed the bloated face
of his enemy. He passed his long cane into his left hand, and with his
right thrust negligently into the breast of his doublet, he swung to
Lord Julian, who was thoughtfully frowning.
NA
NA
NA
and I had hoped that we might be friends. But since you prefer to
NA
Deputy-Governor.
Blood completed the sentence in his own way:
â€œYe mean that ye havenâ€™t the strength of character to resist the urgings
NA
well--as I said before--praemonitus, praemunitus. Iâ€™m afraid that yeâ€™re
NA
NA
NA
NA
call.
Then with a sudden audible catch in his breath, he stopped short.
Captain Bloodâ€™s right hand had reemerged from the breast of his doublet,
bringing with it a long pistol with silver mountings richly chased,
which he levelled within a foot of the Deputy-Governorâ€™s head.
NA
NA
And my lord, who had been moving to Bishopâ€™s assistance, stood instantly
arrested. Chap-fallen, with much of his high colour suddenly departed,
the Deputy-Governor was swaying on unsteady legs. Peter Blood considered
him with a grimness that increased his panic.
â€œI marvel that I donâ€™t pistol you without more ado, ye fat blackguard.
If I donâ€™t, itâ€™s for the same reason that once before I gave ye your
life when it was forfeit. Yeâ€™re not aware of the reason, to be sure; but
it may comfort ye to know that it exists. At the same time Iâ€™ll warn
ye not to put too heavy a strain on my generosity, which resides at the
moment in my trigger-finger. Ye mean to hang me, and since thatâ€™s the
worst that can happen to me anyway, youâ€™ll realize that Iâ€™ll not boggle
NA
cane from him, thus disengaging his left hand. â€œBe good enough to give
NA
Under the compulsion of that sharp tone, those resolute eyes, and that
gleaming pistol, Bishop obeyed without demur. His recent foul volubility
was stemmed. He could not trust himself to speak. Captain Blood tucked
his left arm through the Deputy-Governorâ€™s proffered right. Then he
thrust his own right hand with its pistol back into the breast of his
doublet.
â€œThough invisible, itâ€™s aiming at ye none the less, and I give you my
word of honour that Iâ€™ll shoot ye dead upon the very least provocation,
whether that provocation is yours or anotherâ€™s. Yeâ€™ll bear that in mind,
Lord Julian. And now, ye greasy hangman, step out as brisk and lively as
ye can, and behave as naturally as ye may, or itâ€™s the black stream
NA
house, and down the garden, where Arabella lingered, awaiting Peter
Bloodâ€™s return.
Consideration of his parting words had brought her first turmoil of
mind, then a clear perception of what might be indeed the truth of the
death of Levasseur. She perceived that the particular inference drawn
from it might similarly have been drawn from Bloodâ€™s deliverance of Mary
Traill. When a man so risks his life for a woman, the rest is easily
assumed. For the men who will take such risks without hope of personal
gain are few. Blood was of those few, as he had proved in the case of
Mary Traill.
It needed no further assurances of his to convince her that she had
done him a monstrous injustice. She remembered words he had used--words
overheard aboard his ship (which he had named the Arabella) on the night
of her deliverance from the Spanish admiral; words he had uttered when
she had approved his acceptance of the Kingâ€™s commission; the words he
had spoken to her that very morning, which had but served to move her
indignation. All these assumed a fresh meaning in her mind, delivered
now from its unwarranted preconceptions.
Therefore she lingered there in the garden, awaiting his return that she
might make amends; that she might set a term to all misunderstanding.
In impatience she awaited him. Yet her patience, it seemed, was to be
tested further. For when at last he came, it was in company--unusually
close and intimate company--with her uncle. In vexation she realized
that explanations must be postponed. Could she have guessed the extent
of that postponement, vexation would have been changed into despair.
He passed, with his companion, from that fragrant garden into the
courtyard of the fort. Here the Commandant, who had been instructed to
hold himself in readiness with the necessary men against the need to
effect the arrest of Captain Blood, was amazed by the curious spectacle
of the Deputy-Governor of Jamaica strolling forth arm in arm and
apparently on the friendliest terms with the intended prisoner. For as
they went, Blood was chatting and laughing briskly.
They passed out of the gates unchallenged, and so came to the mole where
the cock-boat from the Arabella was waiting. They took their places side
by side in the stern sheets, and were pulled away together, always very
close and friendly, to the great red ship where Jeremy Pitt so anxiously
awaited news.
You conceive the masterâ€™s amazement to see the Deputy-Governor come
toiling up the entrance ladder, with Blood following very close behind
him.
NA
â€œBut I walked out again, and fetched the trapper with me. He loves his
NA
Colonel Bishop stood in the waist, his great face blenched to the colour
of clay, his mouth loose, almost afraid to look at the sturdy ruffians
who lounged about the shot-rack on the main hatch.
Blood shouted an order to the boâ€™sun, who was leaning against the
forecastle bulkhead.
â€œThrow me a rope with a running noose over the yardarm there, against
the need of it. Now, donâ€™t be alarming yourself, Colonel, darling. Itâ€™s
no more than a provision against your being unreasonable, which I am
sure yeâ€™ll not be. Weâ€™ll talk the matter over whiles we are dining, for
NA
He led away the will-less, cowed bully to the great cabin. Benjamin,
the negro steward, in white drawers and cotton shirt, made haste by his
command to serve dinner.
Colonel Bishop collapsed on the locker under the stern ports, and spoke
now for the first time.
NA
â€œWhy, nothing sinister, Colonel. Although ye deserve nothing less than
that same rope and yardarm, I assure you that itâ€™s to be employed only
as a last resource. Yeâ€™ve said his lordship made a mistake when he
handed me the commission which the Secretary of State did me the honour
to design for me. Iâ€™m disposed to agree with you; so Iâ€™ll take to the
sea again. Cras ingens iterabimus aequor. Itâ€™s the fine Latin scholar
yeâ€™ll be when Iâ€™ve done with ye. Iâ€™ll be getting back to Tortuga and my
buccaneers, who at least are honest, decent fellows. So Iâ€™ve fetched ye
NA
NA
NA
Blood laughed outright. â€œOh, Iâ€™d never serve ye such a bad turn as that.
No, no. All I want is that ye ensure my safe departure from Port Royal.
And, if yeâ€™re reasonable, Iâ€™ll not even trouble you to swim for it this
time. Yeâ€™ve given certain orders to your Harbour-Master, and others to
the Commandant of your plaguey fort. Yeâ€™ll be so good as to send for
them both aboard here, and inform them in my presence that the Arabella
is leaving this afternoon on the Kingâ€™s service and is to pass out
unmolested. And so as to make quite sure of their obedience, they shall
go a little voyage with us, themselves. Hereâ€™s what you require. Now
NA
Colonel Bishop heaved himself up in a pet. â€œYou constrain me with
NA
Blood smoothly interrupted him.
â€œSure, now, I am not constraining you at all. Iâ€™m giving you a perfectly
free choice between the pen and the rope. Itâ€™s a matter for yourself
NA
Bishop glared at him; then shrugging heavily, he took up the pen and
sat down at the table. In an unsteady hand he wrote that summons to his
officers. Blood despatched it ashore; and then bade his unwilling guest
to table.
NA
The wretched Bishop took the seat to which he was commanded. As for
eating, however, that was not easy to a man in his position; nor did
Blood press him. The Captain, himself, fell to with a good appetite.
But before he was midway through the meal came Hayton to inform him
that Lord Julian Wade had just come aboard, and was asking to see him
instantly.
NA
Lord Julian came. He was very stern and dignified. His eyes took in the
situation at a glance, as Captain Blood rose to greet him.
NA
NA
little forced. I donâ€™t know what may be your intentions; but I wonder do
NA
â€œAnd I wonder does your lordship realize the risk to yourself in
NA
NA
Blood signalled to Benjamin, who was standing behind Bishop.
â€œSet a chair for his lordship. Hayton, send his lordshipâ€™s boat ashore.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
quivering with anger.
â€œJust to make myself and my lads here safe from Colonel Bishopâ€™s
gallows. Iâ€™ve said that I trusted to your gallantry not to leave him in
the lurch, but to follow him hither, and thereâ€™s a note from his hand
gone ashore to summon the Harbour-Master and the Commandant of the
fort. Once they are aboard, I shall have all the hostages I need for our
NA
NA
NA
â€œOrdinarily it isnâ€™t the kind of name I could suffer any man to apply to
me. Still, considering that ye willingly did me a service once, and
that yeâ€™re likely unwillingly to do me another now, Iâ€™ll overlook your
NA
NA
aboard your pirate ship without taking my measures? I informed the
Commandant of exactly how you had compelled Colonel Bishop to accompany
you. Judge now whether he or the Harbour-Master will obey the summons,
NA
NA
I thought you would be, answered his lordship.
â€œOh, but not on my own account. Itâ€™s the Deputy-Governor there Iâ€™m sorry
for. Dâ€™ye know what Yeâ€™ve done? Sure, now, yeâ€™ve very likely hanged
NA
NA
â€œIf they so much as put a shot across my bows, up goes their
Deputy-Governor to the yardarm. Your only hope, Colonel, lies in the
fact that I shall send them word of that intention. And so that you may
mend as far as you can the harm you have done, itâ€™s yourself shall bear
NA
NA
â€œWhy, thatâ€™s unreasonable and unreasoning. But if ye insist, why,
another messenger will do as well, and another hostage aboard--as I had
NA
Lord Julian stared at him, realizing exactly what he had refused.
NA
NA
NA
His lordship surveyed him with an eye that was not by any means
NA
turned again to Blood.
â€œI suppose I can trust you that no harm will come to Colonel Bishop if
NA
NA
NA
Lord Julian bowed stiffly to the cowering Deputy-Governor. â€œYou
NA
NA
NA
escorted him to the entrance ladder at the foot of which still swung the
Arabellaâ€™s own cock-boat.
NA
 He proffered a parchment that he had drawn from his pocket. â€œItâ€™s the
NA
Lord Julian considered him, and considering him his expression softened.
NA
NA
NA
Yet with his foot on the first rung of the ladder, Lord Julian
hesitated.
â€œI still do not perceive--blister me if I do!--why you should not have
found some one else to carry your message to the Commandant, and kept me
NA
Bloodâ€™s vivid eyes looked into the otherâ€™s that were clear and honest,
and he smiled, a little wistfully. A moment he seemed to hesitate. Then
he explained himself quite fully.
â€œWhy shouldnâ€™t I tell you? Itâ€™s the same reason thatâ€™s been urging me
to pick a quarrel with you so that I might have the satisfaction of
slipping a couple of feet of steel into your vitals. When I accepted
your commission, I was moved to think it might redeem me in the eyes of
Miss Bishop--for whose sake, as you may have guessed, I took it. But
I have discovered that such a thing is beyond accomplishment. I should
have known it for a sick manâ€™s dream. I have discovered also that if
sheâ€™s choosing you, as I believe she is, sheâ€™s choosing wisely between
us, and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ll not have your life risked by keeping you aboard
whilst the message goes by another who might bungle it. And now perhaps
NA
Lord Julian stared at him bewildered. His long, aristocratic face was
very pale.
NA
â€œI tell you because... Oh, plague on it!--so that ye may tell her;
so that she may be made to realize that thereâ€™s something of the
unfortunate gentleman left under the thief and pirate she accounts me,
and that her own good is my supreme desire. Knowing that, she may...
faith, she may remember me more kindly--if Itâ€™s only in her prayers.
NA
Lord Julian continued to look at the buccaneer in silence. In silence,
at last, he held out his hand; and in silence Blood took it.
NA
NA
â€œWhere she is concerned see that you make sure that I am right. Good-bye
NA
Lord Julian wrung his hand in silence, went down the ladder, and was
pulled ashore. From the distance he waved to Blood, who stood leaning on
the bulwarks watching the receding cock-boat.
The Arabella sailed within the hour, moving lazily before a sluggish
breeze. The fort remained silent and there was no movement from the
fleet to hinder her departure. Lord Julian had carried the message
effectively, and had added to it his own personal commands.
CHAPTER XXIV. WAR
Five miles out at sea from Port Royal, whence the details of the coast
of Jamaica were losing their sharpness, the Arabella hove to, and the
sloop she had been towing was warped alongside.
Captain Blood escorted his compulsory guest to the head of the ladder.
Colonel Bishop, who for two hours and more had been in a state of mortal
anxiety, breathed freely at last; and as the tide of his fears receded,
so that of his deep-rooted hate of this audacious buccaneer resumed its
normal flow. But he practised circumspection. If in his heart he vowed
that once back in Port Royal there was no effort he would spare, no
nerve he would not strain, to bring Peter Blood to final moorings in
Execution Dock, at least he kept that vow strictly to himself.
Peter Blood had no illusions. He was not, and never would be, the
complete pirate. There was not another buccaneer in all the Caribbean
who would have denied himself the pleasure of stringing Colonel Bishop
from the yardarm, and by thus finally stifling the vindictive planterâ€™s
hatred have increased his own security. But Blood was not of these.
Moreover, in the case of Colonel Bishop there was a particular reason
for restraint. Because he was Arabella Bishopâ€™s uncle, his life must
remain sacred to Captain Blood.
And so the Captain smiled into the sallow, bloated face and the little
eyes that fixed him with a malevolence not to be dissembled.
NA
and from his easy, smiling manner you would never have dreamt of the
pain he carried in his breast. â€œItâ€™s the second time yeâ€™ve served me for
a hostage. Yeâ€™ll be well advised to avoid a third. Iâ€™m not lucky to you,
NA
Jeremy Pitt, the master, lounging at Bloodâ€™s elbow, looked darkly upon
the departure of the Deputy-Governor. Behind them a little mob of grim,
stalwart, sun-tanned buccaneers were restrained from cracking Bishop
like a flea only by their submission to the dominant will of their
leader. They had learnt from Pitt while yet in Port Royal of their
Captainâ€™s danger, and whilst as ready as he to throw over the Kingâ€™s
service which had been thrust upon them, yet they resented the manner
in which this had been rendered necessary, and they marvelled now at
Bloodâ€™s restraint where Bishop was concerned. The Deputy-Governor
looked round and met the lowering hostile glances of those fierce eyes.
Instinct warned him that his life at that moment was held precariously,
that an injudicious word might precipitate an explosion of hatred from
which no human power could save him. Therefore he said nothing. He
inclined his head in silence to the Captain, and went blundering and
stumbling in his haste down that ladder to the sloop and its waiting
negro crew.
They pushed off the craft from the red hull of the Arabella, bent to
their sweeps, then, hoisting sail, headed back for Port Royal, intent
upon reaching it before darkness should come down upon them. And Bishop,
the great bulk of him huddled in the stem sheets, sat silent, his black
brows knitted, his coarse lips pursed, malevolence and vindictiveness
so whelming now his recent panic that he forgot his near escape of the
yardarm and the running noose.
On the mole at Port Royal, under the low, embattled wall of the fort,
Major Mallard and Lord Julian waited to receive him, and it was with
infinite relief that they assisted him from the sloop.
Major Mallard was disposed to be apologetic.
NA
spite of your excellencyâ€™s being aboard but for your own orders by Lord
Julian, and his lordshipâ€™s assurance that he had Bloodâ€™s word for
it that no harm should come to you so that no harm came to him. Iâ€™ll
confess I thought it rash of his lordship to accept the word of a damned
NA
NA
Majorâ€™s too eager eloquence. He spoke with an unusual degree of that
frosty dignity he could assume upon occasion. The fact is that his
lordship was in an exceedingly bad humour. Having written jubilantly
home to the Secretary of State that his mission had succeeded, he was
now faced with the necessity of writing again to confess that this
success had been ephemeral. And because Major Mallardâ€™s crisp mostachios
were lifted by a sneer at the notion of a buccaneerâ€™s word being
acceptable, he added still more sharply: â€œMy justification is here in
the person of Colonel Bishop safely returned. As against that, sir, your
NA
NA
irony. â€œTo be sure, here is the Colonel safe and sound. And out yonder
is Captain Blood, also safe and sound, to begin his piratical ravages
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œIf I spend the last shilling of my fortune and the last ship of the
Jamaica fleet, Iâ€™ll have that rascal in a hempen necktie before I rest.
NA
and the veins of his forehead stood out like whipcord. Then he checked.
NA
Major. With that he turned from him, and took his lordship by the arm.
NA
They went off together, skirting the redoubt, and so through courtyard
and garden to the house where Arabella waited anxiously. The sight of
her uncle brought her infinite relief, not only on his own account, but
on account also of Captain Blood.
NA
ordinary greetings had been exchanged.
But Lord Julian answered her as he had answered Major Mallard. â€œThere
NA
She looked at him in some astonishment. His long, aristocratic face wore
a more melancholy, pensive air than usual. He answered the enquiry in
her glance:
â€œSo that Bloodâ€™s ship were allowed to pass the fort, no harm could come
NA
A faint smile broke the set of her lips, which hitherto had been
wistful, and a little colour tinged her cheeks. She would have pursued
the subject, but the Deputy-Governorâ€™s mood did not permit it. He
sneered and snorted at the notion of Bloodâ€™s word being good for
anything, forgetting that he owed to it his own preservation at that
moment.
At supper, and for long thereafter he talked of nothing but Blood--of
how he would lay him by the heels, and what hideous things he would
perform upon his body. And as he drank heavily the while, his speech
became increasingly gross and his threats increasingly horrible; until
in the end Arabella withdrew, white-faced and almost on the verge of
tears. It was not often that Bishop revealed himself to his niece. Oddly
enough, this coarse, overbearing planter went in a certain awe of that
slim girl. It was as if she had inherited from her father the respect in
which he had always been held by his brother.
Lord Julian, who began to find Bishop disgusting beyond endurance,
excused himself soon after, and went in quest of the lady. He had yet to
deliver the message from Captain Blood, and this, he thought, would be
his opportunity. But Miss Bishop had retired for the night, and
Lord Julian must curb his impatience--it amounted by now to nothing
less--until the morrow.
Very early next morning, before the heat of the day came to render the
open intolerable to his lordship, he espied her from his window moving
amid the azaleas in the garden. It was a fitting setting for one who was
still as much a delightful novelty to him in womanhood as was the azalea
among flowers. He hurried forth to join her, and when, aroused from
her pensiveness, she had given him a good-morrow, smiling and frank, he
explained himself by the announcement that he bore her a message from
Captain Blood.
He observed her little start and the slight quiver of her lips, and
observed thereafter not only her pallor and the shadowy rings about her
eyes, but also that unusually wistful air which last night had escaped
his notice.
They moved out of the open to one of the terraces, where a pergola of
orange-trees provided a shaded sauntering space that was at once cool
and fragrant. As they went, he considered her admiringly, and marvelled
at himself that it should have taken him so long fully to realize
her slim, unusual grace, and to find her, as he now did, so entirely
desirable, a woman whose charm must irradiate all the life of a man, and
touch its commonplaces into magic.
He noted the sheen of her red-brown hair, and how gracefully one of its
heavy ringlets coiled upon her slender, milk-white neck. She wore a gown
of shimmering grey silk, and a scarlet rose, fresh-gathered, was pinned
at her breast like a splash of blood. Always thereafter when he thought
of her it was as he saw her at that moment, as never, I think, until
that moment had he seen her.
In silence they paced on a little way into the green shade. Then she
paused and faced him.
NA
some of her impatience.
He fingered the ringlets of his periwig, a little embarrassed how to
NA
said at last, â€œto give you a message that should prove to you that there
is still something left in him of the unfortunate gentleman that...
NA
NA
her, of course, knowing nothing of the enlightenment that yesterday had
come to her.
NA
Her hazel eyes continued to regard him.
NA
To him, this was confusing. He did not immediately answer. He found that
he had not sufficiently considered the terms he should employ, and the
matter, after all, was of an exceeding delicacy, demanding delicate
handling. It was not so much that he was concerned to deliver a message
as to render it a vehicle by which to plead his own cause. Lord Julian,
well versed in the lore of womankind and usually at his ease with ladies
of the beau-monde, found himself oddly constrained before this frank and
unsophisticated niece of a colonial planter.
They moved on in silence and as if by common consent towards the
brilliant sunshine where the pergola was intersected by the avenue
leading upwards to the house. Across this patch of light fluttered a
gorgeous butterfly, that was like black and scarlet velvet and large
as a manâ€™s hand. His lordshipâ€™s brooding eyes followed it out of sight
before he answered.
â€œIt is not easy. Stab me, it is not. He was a man who deserved well. And
amongst us we have marred his chances: your uncle, because he could not
forget his rancour; you, because... because having told him that in the
Kingâ€™s service he would find his redemption of what was past, you would
not afterwards admit to him that he was so redeemed. And this, although
concern to rescue you was the chief motive of his embracing that same

She had turned her shoulder to him so that he should not see her face.
NA
question: â€œAnd you? What part has your lordship had in this--that you
NA
NA
when determined to perform a thing they fear. â€œIf I understood him
aright, if he understood aright, himself, my part, though entirely
passive, was none the less effective. I implore you to observe that
NA
unusual nervousness was steadily increasing. â€œHe thought, then--so
he told me--that my presence here had contributed to his inability to
redeem himself in your sight; and unless he were so redeemed, then was

She faced him fully, a frown of perplexity bringing her brows together
above her troubled eyes.
NA
asked for enlightenment. He plunged on to afford it her, his glance a
little scared, his cheeks flushing.
â€œAye, and he said so in terms which told me something that I hope above
all things, and yet dare not believe, for, God knows, I am no coxcomb,
Arabella. He said... but first let me tell you how I was placed. I had
gone aboard his ship to demand the instant surrender of your uncle whom
he held captive. He laughed at me. Colonel Bishop should be a hostage
for his safety. By rashly venturing aboard his ship, I afforded him
in my own person yet another hostage as valuable at least as Colonel
Bishop. Yet he bade me depart; not from the fear of consequences, for
he is above fear, nor from any personal esteem for me whom he confessed
that he had come to find detestable; and this for the very reason that
NA
NA
NA
â€œIt seems so only. The fact is, Arabella, this unfortunate man has
NA
She cried out at that, and clutched her breast whose calm was suddenly
disturbed. Her eyes dilated as she stared at him.
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, then: he saw in me one who made it impossible that he should win
you--so he said. Therefore he could with satisfaction have killed me.
But because my death might cause you pain, because your happiness was
the thing that above all things he desired, he surrendered that part of
his guarantee of safety which my person afforded him. If his departure
should be hindered, and I should lose my life in what might follow,
there was the risk that... that you might mourn me. That risk he would
not take. Him you deemed a thief and a pirate, he said, and added
that--I am giving you his own words always--if in choosing between us
two, your choice, as he believed, would fall on me, then were you in his
opinion choosing wisely. Because of that he bade me leave his ship, and
NA
She looked at him with eyes that were aswim with tears. He took a step
towards her, a catch in his breath, his hand held out.
NA
But she continued silently to regard him with those tear-laden eyes,
without speaking, and until she spoke he dared not advance farther.
A doubt, a tormenting doubt beset him. When presently she spoke, he saw
how true had been the instinct of which that doubt was born, for her
words revealed the fact that of all that he had said the only thing
that had touched her consciousness and absorbed it from all other
considerations was Bloodâ€™s conduct as it regarded herself.
NA
through the slender, clustering trunks of the bordering orange-trees
she looked out across the glittering waters of the great harbour to
the distant hills. Thus for a little while, my lord standing stiffly,
fearfully, waiting for fuller revelation of her mind. At last it came,
slowly, deliberately, in a voice that at moments was half suffocated.
â€œLast night when my uncle displayed his rancour and his evil rage, it
began to be borne in upon me that such vindictiveness can belong only to
those who have wronged. It is the frenzy into which men whip themselves
to justify an evil passion. I must have known then, if I had not already
learnt it, that I had been too credulous of all the unspeakable things
attributed to Peter Blood. Yesterday I had his own explanation of that
tale of Levasseur that you heard in St. Nicholas. And now this... this
but gives me confirmation of his truth and worth. To a scoundrel such as
I was too readily brought to believe him, the act of which you have just
NA
NA
â€œIt must be. But even if it were not, that would now weigh for nothing.
What weighs--oh, so heavily and bitterly--is the thought that but for
the words in which yesterday I repelled him, he might have been saved.
If only I could have spoken to him again before he went! I waited for
him; but my uncle was with him, and I had no suspicion that he was going
away again. And now he is lost--back at his outlawry and piracy, in
which ultimately he will be taken and destroyed. And the fault is
NA
â€œWhat are you saying? The only agents were your uncleâ€™s hostility and
his own obstinacy which would not study compromise. You must not blame
NA
She swung to him with some impatience, her eyes aswim in tears. â€œYou can
say that, and in spite of his message, which in itself tells how much
I was to blame! It was my treatment of him, the epithets I cast at him
NA
NA
will afford you solace--you may still count on me to do what man can to

She caught her breath.

Could any other matter signify in such a moment.

closely. This thing that Blood believed, that prompted him..., that ...

NA
not your friendship only that I ask, Arabella. You heard what I said,

Gently she sought to disengage her hand, the trouble in her face
increasing. A moment he resisted; then, realizing what he did, he set
her free.
NA
NA
hopes came clattering down about him, leaving him a little stunned. As
he had said, he was no coxcomb. Yet there was something that he did
not understand. She confessed to friendship, and it was in his power
to offer her a great position, one to which she, a colonial planterâ€™s
niece, however wealthy, could never have aspired even in her dreams.
This she rejected, yet spoke of friendship. Peter Blood had been
mistaken, then. How far had he been mistaken? Had he been as mistaken in
her feelings towards himself as he obviously was in her feelings towards
his lordship? In that case ... His reflections broke short. To speculate
was to wound himself in vain. He must know. Therefore he asked her with
grim frankness:
NA
NA
of his question. When understanding came, a flush suffused her face.
NA
This was hardly a truthful answer. For, as if an obscuring veil had
suddenly been rent that morning, she was permitted at last to see Peter
Blood in his true relations to other men, and that sight, vouchsafed
her twenty-four hours too late, filled her with pity and regret and
yearning.
Lord Julian knew enough of women to be left in no further doubt. He
bowed his head so that she might not see the anger in his eyes, for as
a man of honour he took shame in that anger which as a human being he
could not repress.
And because Nature in him was stronger--as it is in most of us--than
training, Lord Julian from that moment began, almost in spite of
himself, to practise something that was akin to villainy. I regret
to chronicle it of one for whom--if I have done him any sort of
justice--you should have been conceiving some esteem. But the truth
is that the lingering remains of the regard in which he had held Peter
Blood were choked by the desire to supplant and destroy a rival. He had
passed his word to Arabella that he would use his powerful influence on
Bloodâ€™s behalf. I deplore to set it down that not only did he forget his
pledge, but secretly set himself to aid and abet Arabellaâ€™s uncle in the
plans he laid for the trapping and undoing of the buccaneer. He might
reasonably have urged--had he been taxed with it--that he conducted
himself precisely as his duty demanded. But to that he might have been
answered that duty with him was but the slave of jealousy in this.
When the Jamaica fleet put to sea some few days later, Lord Julian
sailed with Colonel Bishop in Vice-Admiral Craufurdâ€™s flagship. Not only
was there no need for either of them to go, but the Deputy-Governorâ€™s
duties actually demanded that he should remain ashore, whilst Lord
Julian, as we know, was a useless man aboard a ship. Yet both set out
to hunt Captain Blood, each making of his duty a pretext for the
satisfaction of personal aims; and that common purpose became a link
between them, binding them in a sort of friendship that must otherwise
have been impossible between men so dissimilar in breeding and in
aspirations.
The hunt was up. They cruised awhile off Hispaniola, watching the
Windward Passage, and suffering the discomforts of the rainy season
which had now set in. But they cruised in vain, and after a month of
it, returned empty-handed to Port Royal, there to find awaiting them the
most disquieting news from the Old World.
The megalomania of Louis XIV had set Europe in a blaze of war. The
French legionaries were ravaging the Rhine provinces, and Spain had
joined the nations leagued to defend themselves from the wild ambitions
of the King of France. And there was worse than this: there were rumours
of civil war in England, where the people had grown weary of the bigoted
tyranny of King James. It was reported that William of Orange had been
invited to come over.
Weeks passed, and every ship from home brought additional news. William
had crossed to England, and in March of that year 1689 they learnt in
Jamaica that he had accepted the crown and that James had thrown himself
into the arms of France for rehabilitation.
To a kinsman of Sunderlandâ€™s this was disquieting news, indeed. It was
followed by letters from King Williamâ€™s Secretary of State informing
Colonel Bishop that there was war with France, and that in view of its
effect upon the Colonies a Governor-General was coming out to the
West Indies in the person of Lord Willoughby, and that with him came a
squadron under the command of Admiral van der Kuylen to reenforce the
Jamaica fleet against eventualities.
Bishop realized that this must mean the end of his supreme authority,
even though he should continue in Port Royal as Deputy-Governor. Lord
Julian, in the lack of direct news to himself, did not know what it
might mean to him. But he had been very close and confidential with
Colonel Bishop regarding his hopes of Arabella, and Colonel Bishop more
than ever, now that political events put him in danger of being retired,
was anxious to enjoy the advantages of having a man of Lord Julianâ€™s
eminence for his relative.
They came to a complete understanding in the matter, and Lord Julian
disclosed all that he knew.

On that expedition they sailed two days later--which would be some three
months after Bloodâ€™s departure--taking every ship of the fleet, and
several lesser vessels as auxiliaries. To Arabella and the world in
general it was given out that they were going to raid French Hispaniola,
which was really the only expedition that could have afforded Colonel
Bishop any sort of justification for leaving Jamaica at all at such
a time. His sense of duty, indeed, should have kept him fast in
Port Royal; but his sense of duty was smothered in hatred--that most
fruitless and corruptive of all the emotions. In the great cabin of
Vice-Admiral Craufurdâ€™s flagship, the Imperator, the Deputy-Governor got
drunk that night to celebrate his conviction that the sands of Captain
Bloodâ€™s career were running out.
CHAPTER XXV. THE SERVICE OF KING LOUIS
Meanwhile, some three months before Colonel Bishop set out to reduce
Tortuga, Captain Blood, bearing hell in his soul, had blown into its
rockbound harbour ahead of the winter gales, and two days ahead of the
frigate in which Wolverstone had sailed from Port Royal a day before
him.
In that snug anchorage he found his fleet awaiting him--the four ships
which had been separated in that gale off the Lesser Antilles, and some
seven hundred men composing their crews. Because they had been beginning
to grow anxious on his behalf, they gave him the greater welcome. Guns
were fired in his honour and the ships made themselves gay with bunting.
The town, aroused by all this noise in the harbour, emptied itself
upon the jetty, and a vast crowd of men and women of all creeds and
nationalities collected there to be present at the coming ashore of the
great buccaneer.
Ashore he went, probably for no other reason than to obey the general
expectation. His mood was taciturn; his face grim and sneering. Let
Wolverstone arrive, as presently he would, and all this hero-worship
would turn to execration.
His captains, Hagthorpe, Christian, and Yberville, were on the jetty to
receive him, and with them were some hundreds of his buccaneers. He cut
short their greetings, and when they plagued him with questions of where
he had tarried, he bade them await the coming of Wolverstone, who would
satisfy their curiosity to a surfeit. On that he shook them off, and
shouldered his way through that heterogeneous throng that was composed
of bustling traders of several nations--English, French, and Dutch--of
planters and of seamen of various degrees, of buccaneers who were
fruit-selling half-castes, negro slaves, some doll-tearsheets and
dunghill-queans from the Old World, and all the other types of the human
family that converted the quays of Cayona into a disreputable image of
Babel.
Winning clear at last, and after difficulties, Captain Blood took his
way alone to the fine house of M. dâ€™Ogeron, there to pay his respects to
his friends, the Governor and the Governorâ€™s family.
At first the buccaneers jumped to the conclusion that Wolverstone was
following with some rare prize of war, but gradually from the reduced
crew of the Arabella a very different tale leaked out to stem their
satisfaction and convert it into perplexity. Partly out of loyalty to
their captain, partly because they perceived that if he was guilty of
defection they were guilty with him, and partly because being simple,
sturdy men of their hands, they were themselves in the main a little
confused as to what really had happened, the crew of the Arabella
practised reticence with their brethren in Tortuga during those two
days before Wolverstoneâ€™s arrival. But they were not reticent enough
to prevent the circulation of certain uneasy rumours and extravagant
stories of discreditable adventures--discreditable, that is, from the
buccaneering point of view--of which Captain Blood had been guilty.
But that Wolverstone came when he did, it is possible that there would
have been an explosion. When, however, the Old Wolf cast anchor in the
bay two days later, it was to him all turned for the explanation they
were about to demand of Blood.
Now Wolverstone had only one eye; but he saw a deal more with that
one eye than do most men with two; and despite his grizzled head--so
picturesquely swathed in a green and scarlet turban--he had the sound
heart of a boy, and in that heart much love for Peter Blood.
The sight of the Arabella at anchor in the bay had at first amazed him
as he sailed round the rocky headland that bore the fort. He rubbed his
single eye clear of any deceiving film and looked again. Still he could
not believe what it saw. And then a voice at his elbow--the voice of
Dyke, who had elected to sail with him--assured him that he was not
singular in his bewilderment.
NA
The Old Wolf rolled his single eye over Dyke, and opened his mouth to
speak. Then he closed it again without having spoken; closed it tightly.
He had a great gift of caution, especially in matters that he did not
understand. That this was the Arabella he could no longer doubt. That
being so, he must think before he spoke. What the devil should the
Arabella be doing here, when he had left her in Jamaica? And was Captain
Blood aboard and in command, or had the remainder of her hands made off
with her, leaving the Captain in Port Royal?
Dyke repeated his question. This time Wolverstone answered him.
â€œYeâ€™ve two eyes to see with, and ye ask me, whoâ€™s only got one, what it
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Wolverstone looked him over in contempt, then laughed and spoke loud
NA
laughed again, a laugh that seemed to Dyke to be calling him a fool.
On that Wolverstone turned to give his attention to the operation of
anchoring.
Anon when ashore he was beset by questioning buccaneers, it was from
their very questions that he gathered exactly how matters stood, and
perceived that either from lack of courage or other motive Blood,
himself, had refused to render any account of his doings since the
Arabella had separated from her sister ships. Wolverstone congratulated
himself upon the discretion he had used with Dyke.
NA
others who came crowding round him. â€œItâ€™s not his way to be sounding his
own praises. Why, it was like this. We fell in with old Don Miguel,
and when weâ€™d scuttled him we took aboard a London pimp sent out by the
Secretary of State to offer the Captain the Kingâ€™s commission if so be
himâ€™d quit piracy and be oâ€™ good behaviour. The Captain damned his soul
to hell for answer. And then we fell in wiâ€™ the Jamaica fleet and that
grey old devil Bishop in command, and there was a sure end to Captain
Blood and to every motherâ€™s son of us all. So I goes to him, and â€˜accept
this poxy commission,â€™ says I; â€˜turn Kingâ€™s man and save your neck and
ours.â€™ He took me at my word, and the London pimp gave him the Kingâ€™s
commission on the spot, and Bishop all but choked hisself with rage when
he was told of it. But happened it had, and he was forced to swallow
it. We were Kingâ€™s men all, and so into Port Royal we sailed along
oâ€™ Bishop. But Bishop didnâ€™t trust us. He knew too much. But for his
lordship, the fellow from London, heâ€™d haâ€™ hanged the Captain, Kingâ€™s
commission and all. Blood would haâ€™ slipped out oâ€™ Port Royal again that
same night. But that hound Bishop had passed the word, and the fort kept
a sharp lookout. In the end, though it took a fortnight, Blood bubbled
him. He sent me and most oâ€™ the men off in a frigate that I bought for
the voyage. His game--as heâ€™d secretly told me--was to follow and give
chase. Whether thatâ€™s the game he played or not I canâ€™t tell ye; but
NA
There was a great historian lost in Wolverstone. He had the right
imagination that knows just how far it is safe to stray from the truth
and just how far to colour it so as to change its shape for his own
purposes.
Having delivered himself of his decoction of fact and falsehood, and
thereby added one more to the exploits of Peter Blood, he enquired
where the Captain might be found. Being informed that he kept his ship,
Wolverstone stepped into a boat and went aboard, to report himself, as
he put it.
In the great cabin of the Arabella he found Peter Blood alone and very
far gone in drink--a condition in which no man ever before remembered to
have seen him. As Wolverstone came in, the Captain raised bloodshot eyes
to consider him. A moment they sharpened in their gaze as he brought
his visitor into focus. Then he laughed, a loose, idiot laugh, that yet
somehow was half a sneer.
NA
NA
loosely in his chair.
Old Wolverstone stared at him in sombre silence. He had looked with
untroubled eye upon many a hell of devilment in his time, but the sight
of Captain Blood in this condition filled him with sudden grief. To
express it he loosed an oath. It was his only expression for emotion
of all kinds. Then he rolled forward, and dropped into a chair at the
table, facing the Captain.
NA
NA
towards Wolverstone.
Wolverstone disregarded them.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Captain steadied himself to grasp it.
NA
â€œAnd... oh, no marrer! Much obliged to ye, Old Wolf--faithful Old Wolf!
But was it worthertrouble? Iâ€™m norrer pirate now; never a pirate again.
NA
NA
 said Wolverstone, rising. â€œMeanwhile yeâ€™ll please to remember the tale
Iâ€™ve told, and say nothing thatâ€™ll make me out a liar. They all believes
me, even the men as sailed wiâ€™ me from Port Royal. Iâ€™ve made â€˜em. If
they thought as how youâ€™d taken the Kingâ€™s commission in earnest, and
NA
NA
NA
They did; but to little purpose, either that day or on any day
thereafter while the rains--which set in that night--endured. Soon the
shrewd Wolverstone discovered that rum was not what ailed Blood. Rum
was in itself an effect, and not by any means the cause of the Captainâ€™s
listless apathy. There was a canker eating at his heart, and the Old
Wolf knew enough to make a shrewd guess of its nature. He cursed all
things that daggled petticoats, and, knowing his world, waited for the
sickness to pass.
But it did not pass. When Blood was not dicing or drinking in the
taverns of Tortuga, keeping company that in his saner days he had
loathed, he was shut up in his cabin aboard the Arabella, alone and
uncommunicative. His friends at Government House, bewildered at
this change in him, sought to reclaim him. Mademoiselle dâ€™Ogeron,
particularly distressed, sent him almost daily invitations, to few of
which he responded.
Later, as the rainy season approached its end, he was sought by his
captains with proposals of remunerative raids on Spanish settlements.
But to all he manifested an indifference which, as the weeks passed
and the weather became settled, begot first impatience and then
exasperation.
Christian, who commanded the Clotho, came storming to him one day,
upbraiding him for his inaction, and demanding that he should take order
about what was to do.
NA
departed fuming, and on the morrow the Clotho weighed anchor and sailed
away, setting an example of desertion from which the loyalty of Bloodâ€™s
other captains would soon be unable to restrain their men.
Sometimes Blood asked himself why had he come back to Tortuga at all.
Held fast in bondage by the thought of Arabella and her scorn of him for
a thief and a pirate, he had sworn that he had done with buccaneering.
Why, then, was he here? That question he would answer with another:
Where else was he to go? Neither backward nor forward could he move, it
seemed.
He was degenerating visibly, under the eyes of all. He had entirely lost
the almost foppish concern for his appearance, and was grown careless
and slovenly in his dress. He allowed a black beard to grow on cheeks
that had ever been so carefully shaven; and the long, thick black hair,
once so sedulously curled, hung now in a lank, untidy mane about a face
that was changing from its vigorous swarthiness to an unhealthy sallow,
whilst the blue eyes, that had been so vivid and compelling, were now
dull and lacklustre.
Wolverstone, the only one who held the clue to this degeneration,
ventured once--and once only--to beard him frankly about it.
NA
growled. â€œWill you spend your days moping and swilling â€˜cause a
white-faced ninny in Port Royalâ€™ll have none oâ€™ ye? â€˜Sblood and â€˜ounds!
NA
The blue eyes glared at him from under the jet-black eyebrows, and
something of their old fire began to kindle in them. But Wolverstone
went on heedlessly.
â€œIâ€™ll be nice wiâ€™ a wench as long as niceness be the key to her favour.
But sink me now if Iâ€™d rot myself in rum on account of anything that
wears a petticoat. Thatâ€™s not the Old Wolfâ€™s way. If thereâ€™s no other
expeditionâ€™ll tempt you, why not Port Royal? What a plague do it matter
if it is an English settlement? Itâ€™s commanded by Colonel Bishop, and
thereâ€™s no lack of rascals in your companyâ€™d follow you to hell if it
meant getting Colonel Bishop by the throat. It could be done, I tell
you. Weâ€™ve but to spy the chance when the Jamaica fleet is away. Thereâ€™s
enough plunder in the town to tempt the lads, and thereâ€™s the wench for
NA
Blood was on his feet, his eyes blazing, his livid face distorted.
â€œYeâ€™ll leave my cabin this minute, so ye will, or, by Heaven, itâ€™s your
corpseâ€™ll be carried out of it. Ye mangy hound, dâ€™ye dare come to me
NA
He fell to cursing his faithful officer with a virulence the like of
which he had never yet been known to use. And Wolverstone, in terror
before that fury, went out without another word. The subject was not
raised again, and Captain Blood was left to his idle abstraction.
But at last, as his buccaneers were growing desperate, something
happened, brought about by the Captainâ€™s friend M. dâ€™Ogeron. One sunny
morning the Governor of Tortuga came aboard the Arabella, accompanied
by a chubby little gentleman, amiable of countenance, amiable and
self-sufficient of manner.
NA
NA
Out of consideration for his friend, Captain Blood pulled the pipe from
his mouth, shook some of the rum out of his wits, and rose and made a
leg to M. de Cussy.
NA
M. de Cussy returned the bow and accepted a seat on the locker under the
stem windows.
NA
NA
NA
NA
M. de Cussy took snuff delicately. â€œI have something better than that to
NA
NA
M. de Cussy looked at M. dâ€™Ogeron, and raised his eyebrows a little.
He did not find Captain Blood encouraging. But M. dâ€™Ogeron nodded
vigorously with pursed lips, and the Governor of Hispaniola propounded
his business.
NA
NA
â€œI am speaking officially, my Captain. I am not alluding to unofficial
skirmishes, and unofficial predatory measures which we have condoned out
here. There is war--formally war--between France and Spain in Europe. It
is the intention of France that this war shall be carried into the New
World. A fleet is coming out from Brest under the command of M. le Baron
de Rivarol for that purpose. I have letters from him desiring me to
equip a supplementary squadron and raise a body of not less than a
thousand men to reenforce him on his arrival. What I have come to
propose to you, my Captain, at the suggestion of our good friend M.
dâ€™Ogeron, is, in brief, that you enroll your ships and your force under
NA
Blood looked at him with a faint kindling of interest. â€œYou are
NA
NA
â€œWith the rank of Capitaine de Vaisseau for yourself, and suitable ranks
for the officers serving under you. You will enjoy the pay of that rank,
and you will be entitled, together with your men, to one-tenth share in
NA
â€œMy men will hardly account it generous. They will tell you that they
can sail out of here to-morrow, disembowel a Spanish settlement, and
NA
â€œAh, yes, but with the risks attaching to acts of piracy. With us your
position will be regular and official, and considering the powerful
fleet by which M. de Rivarol is backed, the enterprises to be undertaken
will be on a much vaster scale than anything you could attempt on your
own account. So that the one tenth in this case may be equal to more
NA
Captain Blood considered. This, after all, was not piracy that was being
proposed. It was honourable employment in the service of the King of
France.
NA
They came and the matter was laid before them by M. de Cussy himself.
Hagthorpe announced at once that the proposal was opportune. The men
were grumbling at their protracted inaction, and would no doubt be ready
to accept the service which M. de Cussy offered on behalf of France.
Hagthorpe looked at Blood as he spoke. Blood nodded gloomy agreement.
Emboldened by this, they went on to discuss the terms. Yberville, the
young French filibuster, had the honour to point out to M. de Cussy
that the share offered was too small. For one fifth of the prizes, the
officers would answer for their men; not for less.
M. de Cussy was distressed. He had his instructions. It was taking a
deal upon himself to exceed them. The buccaneers were firm. Unless M. de
Cussy could make it one fifth there was no more to be said. M. de Cussy
finally consenting to exceed his instructions, the articles were drawn
up and signed that very day. The buccaneers were to be at Petit Goave
by the end of January, when M. de Rivarol had announced that he might be
expected.
After that followed days of activity in Tortuga, refitting the ships,
boucanning meat, laying in stores. In these matters which once would
have engaged all Captain Bloodâ€™s attention, he now took no part.
He continued listless and aloof. If he had given his consent to the
undertaking, or, rather, allowed himself to be swept into it by the
wishes of his officers--it was only because the service offered was of a
regular and honourable kind, nowise connected with piracy, with which he
swore in his heart that he had done for ever. But his consent remained
passive. The service entered awoke no zeal in him. He was perfectly
indifferent--as he told Hagthorpe, who ventured once to offer a
remonstrance--whether they went to Petit Goave or to Hades, and whether
they entered the service of Louis XIV or of Satan.
CHAPTER XXVI. M. de RIVAROL
Captain Blood was still in that disgruntled mood when he sailed from
Tortuga, and still in that mood when he came to his moorings in the bay
of Petit Goave. In that same mood he greeted M. le Baron de Rivarol when
this nobleman with his fleet of five men-of-war at last dropped anchor
alongside the buccaneer ships, in the middle of February. The Frenchman
had been six weeks on the voyage, he announced, delayed by unfavourable
weather.
Summoned to wait on him, Captain Blood repaired to the Castle of
Petit Goave, where the interview was to take place. The Baron, a tall,
hawk-faced man of forty, very cold and distant of manner, measured
Captain Blood with an eye of obvious disapproval. Of Hagthorpe,
Yberville, and Wolverstone who stood ranged behind their captain, he
took no heed whatever. M. de Cussy offered Captain Blood a chair.
â€œA moment, M. de Cussy. I do not think M. le Baron has observed that
I am not alone. Let me present to you, sir, my companions: Captain
Hagthorpe of the Elizabeth, Captain Wolverstone of the Atropos, and
NA
The Baron stared hard and haughtily at Captain Blood, then very
distantly and barely perceptibly inclined his head to each of the other
three. His manner implied plainly that he despised them and that he
desired them at once to understand it. It had a curious effect upon
Captain Blood. It awoke the devil in him, and it awoke at the same time
his self-respect which of late had been slumbering. A sudden shame of
his disordered, ill-kempt appearance made him perhaps the more defiant.
There was almost a significance in the way he hitched his sword-belt
round, so that the wrought hilt of his very serviceable rapier was
brought into fuller view. He waved his captains to the chairs that stood
about.
NA
They obeyed him, Wolverstone with a grin that was full of understanding.
Haughtier grew the stare of M. de Rivarol. To sit at table with these
bandits placed him upon what he accounted a dishonouring equality.
It had been his notion that--with the possible exception of Captain
Blood--they should take his instructions standing, as became men of
their quality in the presence of a man of his. He did the only thing
remaining to mark a distinction between himself and them. He put on his
hat.
NA
 And he covered himself with his plumed castor.
M. de Rivarol changed colour. He quivered visibly with anger, and was
a moment controlling himself before venturing to speak. M. de Cussy was
obviously very ill at ease.
NA
rank you hold is that of Capitaine de Vaisseau, and that you are in
the presence of the General of the Armies of France by Sea and Land in
America. You compel me to remind you further that there is a deference
NA
NA
unnecessary. I am by way of accounting myself a gentleman, little though
I may look like one at present; and I should not account myself that
were I capable of anything but deference to those whom nature or fortune
may have placed above me, or to those who being placed beneath me in
NA
neatly intangible rebuke. M. de Rivarol bit his lip. Captain Blood swept
on without giving him time to reply: â€œThus much being clear, shall we
NA
M. de Rivarolâ€™s hard eyes considered him a moment. â€œPerhaps it will be
NA
into which you entered with M. de Cussy. Before going further, I have to
observe that M. de Cussy has exceeded his instructions in admitting
you to one fifth of the prizes taken. His authority did not warrant his
NA
NA
NA
â€œYour pardon, my General. The articles are signed. So far as we are
concerned, the matter is closed. Also out of regard for M. de Cussy, we
should not desire to be witnesses of the rebukes you may consider that

 said he, â€œit but remains for me to present my little account for our
disbursement, and to fix the sum at which we should be compensated for
our loss of time and derangement in coming hither. That settled, we can

NA
across the table.
â€œIs it possible that I am obscure? My French, perhaps, is not of the

â€œOh, your French is fluent enough; too fluent at moments, if I may
permit myself the observation. Now, look you here, M. le filibustier, I
am not a man with whom it is safe to play the fool, as you may very soon
discover. You have accepted service of the King of France--you and your
men; you hold the rank and draw the pay of a Capitaine de Vaisseau,
and these your officers hold the rank of lieutenants. These ranks carry
obligations which you would do well to study, and penalties for failing
to discharge them which you might study at the same time. They are
something severe. The first obligation of an officer is obedience. I
commend it to your attention. You are not to conceive yourselves, as you
appear to be doing, my allies in the enterprises I have in view, but my
subordinates. In me you behold a commander to lead you, not a companion
NA
NA
recovering his normal self amazingly under the inspiring stimulus of
conflict. The only thing that marred his enjoyment was the reflection
that he had not shaved. â€œI forget nothing, I assure you, my General.
I do not forget, for instance, as you appear to be doing, that the
articles we signed are the condition of our service; and the articles
provide that we receive one-fifth share. Refuse us that, and you cancel
the articles; cancel the articles, and you cancel our services with
them. From that moment we cease to have the honour to hold rank in the

There was more than a murmur of approval from his three captains.
Rivarol glared at them, checkmated.
NA

glad to have some one upon whom he could fasten the sharp fangs of his
irritation. â€œYou should be broke for it. You bring the Kingâ€™s service
into disrepute; you force me, His Majestyâ€™s representative, into an

NA
silkily. â€œIn that case, there is no need for beat or for injuries to
M. de Cussy. M. de Cussy knows that we would not have come for less.
We depart again upon your assurance that you cannot award us more. And
things are as they would have been if M. de Cussy had adhered rigidly
to his instructions. I have proved, I hope, to your satisfaction, M.
le Baron, that if you repudiate the articles you can neither claim our
NA
â€œNot in honour, sir? To the devil with your insolence! Do you imply that
NA
NA
Blood. â€œWe should see to that. It is, my General, for you to say whether
NA
NA
NA
Captain Blood rose, his officers rose with him. Captain Blood bowed.
NA
Then he and his buccaneers removed themselves from the August and irate
presence of the General of the Kingâ€™s Armies by Land and Sea in America.
You conceive that there followed for M. de Cussy an extremely bad
quarter of an hour. M. de Cussy, in fact, deserves your sympathy. His
self-sufficiency was blown from him by the haughty M. de Rivarol, as
down from a thistle by the winds of autumn. The General of the Kingâ€™s
Armies abused him--this man who was Governor of Hispaniola--as if he
were a lackey. M. de Cussy defended himself by urging the thing that
Captain Blood had so admirably urged already on his behalf--that if the
terms he had made with the buccaneers were not confirmed there was no
harm done. M. de Rivarol bullied and browbeat him into silence.
Having exhausted abuse, the Baron proceeded to indignities. Since he
accounted that M. de Cussy had proved himself unworthy of the post he
held, M. de Rivarol took over the responsibilities of that post for as
long as he might remain in Hispaniola, and to give effect to this he
began by bringing soldiers from his ships, and setting his own guard in
M. de Cussyâ€™s castle.
Out of this, trouble followed quickly. Wolverstone coming ashore next
morning in the picturesque garb that he affected, his head swathed in a
coloured handkerchief, was jeered at by an officer of the newly landed
French troops. Not accustomed to derision, Wolverstone replied in kind
and with interest. The officer passed to insult, and Wolverstone struck
him a blow that felled him, and left him only the half of his poor
senses. Within the hour the matter was reported to M. de Rivarol, and
before noon, by M. de Rivarolâ€™s orders, Wolverstone was under arrest in
the castle.
The Baron had just sat down to dinner with M. de Cussy when the negro
who waited on them announced Captain Blood. Peevishly M. de Rivarol bade
him be admitted, and there entered now into his presence a spruce and
modish gentleman, dressed with care and sombre richness in black and
silver, his swarthy, clear-cut face scrupulously shaven, his long black
hair in ringlets that fell to a collar of fine point. In his right hand
the gentleman carried a broad black hat with a scarlet ostrich-plume,
in his left hand an ebony cane. His stockings were of silk, a bunch of
ribbons masked his garters, and the black rosettes on his shoes were
finely edged with gold.
For a moment M. de Rivarol did not recognize him. For Blood looked
younger by ten years than yesterday. But the vivid blue eyes under their
level black brows were not to be forgotten, and they proclaimed him for
the man announced even before he had spoken. His resurrected pride had
demanded that he should put himself on an equality with the baron and
advertise that equality by his exterior.

My business could not wait. It concerns, M. de Cussy, Captain

â€œI say mistake. On the whole, it is polite of me to use that word. Also
it is expedient. It will save discussions. Your people have arrested the
wrong man, M. de Rivarol. Instead of the French officer, who used the
grossest provocation, they have arrested Captain Wolverstone. It is a

M. de Rivarolâ€™s hawk-face flamed scarlet. His dark eyes bulged.
NA
 Normally a man of the utmost self-possession he was so rudely shaken now
that he actually stammered.
â€œM. le Baron, you waste words. This is the New World. It is not merely
new; it is novel to one reared amid the superstitions of the Old. That
novelty you have not yet had time, perhaps, to realize; therefore I
overlook the offensive epithet you have used. But justice is justice in
the New World as in the Old, and injustice as intolerable here as there.
Now justice demands the enlargement of my officer and the arrest and
punishment of yours. That justice I invite you, with submission, to

â€œWith the utmost submission, monsieur. But at the same time I will
remind M. le Baron that my buccaneers number eight hundred; your troops
five hundred; and M. de Cussy will inform you of the interesting fact
that any one buccaneer is equal in action to at least three soldiers of
the line. I am perfectly frank with you, monsieur, to save time and hard
words. Either Captain Wolverstone is instantly set at liberty, or we
must take measures to set him at liberty ourselves. The consequences may
be appalling. But it is as you please, M. le Baron. You are the supreme

M. de Rivarol was white to the lips. In all his life he had never been
so bearded and defied. But he controlled himself.

When the door had closed, the baron loosed his fury upon the head of M.
de Cussy.
â€œSo, these are the men you have enlisted in the Kingâ€™s service, the men
who are to serve under me--men who do not serve, but dictate, and this
before the enterprise that has brought me from France is even under way!
What explanations do you offer me, M. de Cussy? I warn you that I am
not pleased with you. I am, in fact, as you may perceive, exceedingly

The Governor seemed to shed his chubbiness. He drew himself stiffly
erect.

shall have a sufficient force to keep them in control. For the rest,
monsieur, they have certain notions of honour. They will stand by their
articles, and so that we deal justly with them, they will deal justly
with us, and give no trouble. I have experience of them, and I pledge

M. de Rivarol condescended to be mollified. It was necessary that he
should save his face, and in a degree the Governor afforded him the
means to do so, as well as a certain guarantee for the future in the
further force he was raising.
NA
The Captain came in, assured and very dignified. M. de Rivarol found him
detestable; but dissembled it.
â€œM. le Capitaine, I have taken counsel with M. le Gouverneur. From what
he tells me, it is possible that a mistake has been committed. Justice,
you may be sure, shall be done. To ensure it, I shall myself preside
over a council to be composed of two of my senior officers, yourself
and an officer of yours. This council shall hold at once an impartial
investigation into the affair, and the offender, the man guilty of

Captain Blood bowed. It was not his wish to be extreme. â€œPerfectly, M.

matter of the articles. Am I to understand that you confirm or that you

M. de Rivarolâ€™s eyes narrowed. His mind was full of what M. de Cussy had
said--that these buccaneers must prove the sharp edge of any weapon he
might forge. He could not dispense with them. He perceived that he
had blundered tactically in attempting to reduce the agreed share.
Withdrawal from a position of that kind is ever fraught with loss of
dignity. But there were those volunteers that M. de Cussy was enrolling
to strengthen the hand of the Kingâ€™s General. Their presence might admit
anon of the reopening of this question. Meanwhile he must retire in the
best order possible.
NA
remains unaltered, I must confess that since M. de Cussy has pledged us,
NA
Captain Blood bowed again. In vain M. de Rivarol looked searchingly
for the least trace of a smile of triumph on those firm lips. The
buccaneerâ€™s face remained of the utmost gravity.
Wolverstone was set at liberty that afternoon, and his assailant
sentenced to two monthsâ€™ detention. Thus harmony was restored. But it
had been an unpromising beginning, and there was more to follow shortly
of a similar discordant kind.
Blood and his officers were summoned a week later to a council which sat
to determine their operations against Spain. M. de Rivarol laid before
them a project for a raid upon the wealthy Spanish town of Cartagena.
Captain Blood professed astonishment. Sourly invited by M. de Rivarol to
state his grounds for it, he did so with the utmost frankness.
NA
have no doubt or hesitation as to the best way in which to serve my
Royal master and the French nation. That which I think will be obvious
to M. de Cussy, as it is to me, is that we should at once invade Spanish
Hispaniola and reduce the whole of this fruitful and splendid island
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou mean, sir, that we are to sail across the Caribbean on an
adventurous expedition, neglecting that which lies here at our very
door. In our absence, a Spanish invasion of French Hispaniola is
possible. If we begin by reducing the Spaniards here, that possibility
will be removed. We shall have added to the Crown of France the
most coveted possession in the West Indies. The enterprise offers
no particular difficulty; it may be speedily accomplished, and once
accomplished, it would be time to look farther afield. That would seem
NA
He ceased, and there was silence. M. de Rivarol sat back in his chair,
the feathered end of a quill between his teeth. Presently he cleared his
throat and asked a question.
NA
None answered him. His own officers were overawed by him; Bloodâ€™s
followers naturally preferred Cartagena, because offering the greater
chance of loot. Loyalty to their leader kept them silent.
NA
smile.
Captain Blood laughed outright. He had suddenly read the Baronâ€™s mind.
His airs and graces and haughtiness had so imposed upon Blood that
it was only now that at last he saw through them, into the fellowâ€™s
peddling spirit. Therefore he laughed; there was really nothing else to
do. But his laughter was charged with more anger even than contempt. He
had been deluding himself that he had done with piracy. The conviction
that this French service was free of any taint of that was the only
consideration that had induced him to accept it. Yet here was this
haughty, supercilious gentleman, who dubbed himself General of the
Armies of France, proposing a plundering, thieving raid which, when
stripped of its mean, transparent mask of legitimate warfare, was
revealed as piracy of the most flagrant.
M. de Rivarol, intrigued by his mirth, scowled upon him disapprovingly.
NA
â€œBecause I discover here an irony that is supremely droll. You, M. le
Baron, General of the Kingâ€™s Armies by Land and Sea in America,
propose an enterprise of a purely buccaneering character; whilst I,
the buccaneer, am urging one that is more concerned with upholding the

M. de Rivarol perceived nothing of the kind. M. de Rivarol in fact was
extremely angry. He bounded to his feet, and every man in the room rose
with him--save only M. de Cussy, who sat on with a grim smile on his
lips. He, too, now read the Baron like an open book, and reading him
despised him.
NA
NA
â€œMy superior officer! You! Lord of the World! Why, you are just a common
pirate! But you shall hear the truth for once, and that before all these
gentlemen who have the honour to serve the King of France. It is for
me, a buccaneer, a sea-robber, to stand here and tell you what is in the
interest of French honour and the French Crown. Whilst you, the French
Kingâ€™s appointed General, neglecting this, are for spending the Kingâ€™s
resources against an outlying settlement of no account, shedding French
blood in seizing a place that cannot be held, only because it has been
reported to you that there is much gold in Cartagena, and that the
plunder of it will enrich you. It is worthy of the huckster who sought
to haggle with us about our share, and to beat us down after the
articles pledging you were already signed. If I am wrong--let M. de
Cussy say so. If I am wrong, let me be proven wrong, and I will beg your
pardon. Meanwhile, monsieur, I withdraw from this council. I will have
no further part in your deliberations. I accepted the service of the
King of France with intent to honour that service. I cannot honour that
service by lending countenance to a waste of life and resources in raids
upon unimportant settlements, with plunder for their only object. The
responsibility for such decisions must rest with you, and with you
alone. I desire M. de Cussy to report me to the Ministers of France. For
the rest, monsieur, it merely remains for you to give me your orders. I
await them aboard my ship--and anything else, of a personal nature, that
you may feel I have provoked by the terms I have felt compelled to use
NA
He stalked out, and his three captains--although they thought him
mad--rolled after him in loyal silence.
M. de Rivarol was gasping like a landed fish. The stark truth had robbed
him of speech. When he recovered, it was to thank Heaven vigorously that
the council was relieved by Captain Bloodâ€™s own act of that gentlemanâ€™s
further participation in its deliberations. Inwardly M. de Rivarol
burned with shame and rage. The mask had been plucked from him, and he
had been held up to scorn--he, the General of the Kingâ€™s Armies by Sea
and Land in America.
Nevertheless, it was to Cartagena that they sailed in the middle of
March. Volunteers and negroes had brought up the forces directly under
M. de Rivarol to twelve hundred men. With these he thought he could keep
the buccaneer contingent in order and submissive.
They made up an imposing fleet, led by M. de Rivarolâ€™s flagship, the
Victorieuse, a mighty vessel of eighty guns. Each of the four other
French ships was at least as powerful as Bloodâ€™s Arabella, which was
of forty guns. Followed the lesser buccaneer vessels, the Elizabeth,
Lachesis, and Atropos, and a dozen frigates laden with stores, besides
canoes and small craft in tow.
Narrowly they missed the Jamaica fleet with Colonel Bishop, which
sailed north for Tortuga two days after the Baron de Rivarolâ€™s southward
passage.
CHAPTER XXVII. CARTAGENA
Having crossed the Caribbean in the teeth of contrary winds, it was not
until the early days of April that the French fleet hove in sight of
Cartagena, and M. de Rivarol summoned a council aboard his flagship to
determine the method of assault.

but before it can remove its treasures inland. I propose to land a
force sufficient to achieve this to the north of the city to-night after

laboured.
He was heard respectfully and approvingly by his officers, scornfully
by Captain Blood, and indifferently by the other buccaneer captains
present. For it must be understood that Bloodâ€™s refusal to attend
councils had related only to those concerned with determining the nature
of the enterprise to be undertaken.
Captain Blood was the only one amongst them who knew exactly what lay
ahead. Two years ago he had himself considered a raid upon the place,
and he had actually made a survey of it in circumstances which he was
presently to disclose.
The Baronâ€™s proposal was one to be expected from a commander whose
knowledge of Cartagena was only such as might be derived from maps.
Geographically and strategically considered, it is a curious place. It
stands almost four-square, screened east and north by hills, and it
may be said to face south upon the inner of two harbours by which it
is normally approached. The entrance to the outer harbour, which is in
reality a lagoon some three miles across, lies through a neck known as
the Boca Chica--or Little Mouth--and defended by a fort. A long strip of
densely wooded land to westward acts here as a natural breakwater, and
as the inner harbour is approached, another strip of land thrusts across
at right angles from the first, towards the mainland on the east. Just
short of this it ceases, leaving a deep but very narrow channel, a
veritable gateway, into the secure and sheltered inner harbour. Another
fort defends this second passage. East and north of Cartagena lies
the mainland, which may be left out of account. But to the west and
northwest this city, so well guarded on every other side, lies directly
open to the sea. It stands back beyond a half-mile of beach, and besides
this and the stout Walls which fortify it, would appear to have no other
defences. But those appearances are deceptive, and they had utterly
deceived M. de Rivarol, when he devised his plan.
It remained for Captain Blood to explain the difficulties when M. de
Rivarol informed him that the honour of opening the assault in the
manner which he prescribed was to be accorded to the buccaneers.
Captain Blood smiled sardonic appreciation of the honour reserved
for his men. It was precisely what he would have expected. For the
buccaneers the dangers; for M. de Rivarol the honour, glory and profit
of the enterprise.
NA
Wolverstone grunted approval and Hagthorpe nodded. Yberville, who
as much as any of them resented the superciliousness of his noble
compatriot, never wavered in loyalty to Captain Blood. The French
officers--there were six of them present--stared their haughty surprise
at the buccaneer leader, whilst the Baron challengingly fired a question
at him.
NA
â€œI understood, M. le Baron, that you summoned us to deliberate upon the

â€œThen you understood amiss, M. le Capitaine. You are here to receive
my commands. I have already deliberated, and I have decided. I hope you
NA
NA
without giving the Baron time to set the angry question that was
bubbling to his lips, he swept on: â€œYou have deliberated, you say, and
you have decided. But unless your decision rests upon a wish to destroy
my buccaneers, you will alter it when I tell you something of which
I have knowledge. This city of Cartagena looks very vulnerable on
the northern side, all open to the sea as it apparently stands. Ask
yourself, M. le Baron, how came the Spaniards who built it where it is
to have been at such trouble to fortify it to the south, if from the

That gave M. de Rivarol pause.

supposing them. Let me tell you, messieurs, that two years ago I made a
survey of Cartagena as a preliminary to raiding it. I came hither with
some friendly trading Indians, myself disguised as an Indian, and in
that guise I spent a week in the city and studied carefully all its
approaches. On the side of the sea where it looks so temptingly open to
assault, there is shoal water for over half a mile out--far enough out,
I assure you, to ensure that no ship shall come within bombarding range
of it. It is not safe to venture nearer land than three quarters of a

â€œIn the calmest season of the year, the surf will hinder any such

guns. In fact, it is the landing parties would be in danger from their

â€œIf the attack is made by night, as I propose, covering will be

haughtiness would not allow him to yield before his officers.
â€œIf you still choose to do so after what I have said, you are, of
course, the person to decide. But I do not lead my men into fruitless

NA
interrupted him.
â€œM. le Baron, when M. de Cussy engaged us on your behalf, it was as much
on account of our knowledge and experience of this class of warfare
as on account of our strength. I have placed my own knowledge and
experience in this particular matter at your disposal. I will add that
I abandoned my own project of raiding Cartagena, not being in sufficient
strength at the time to force the entrance of the harbour, which is the
only way into the city. The strength which you now command is ample for

â€œBut whilst we are doing that, the Spaniards will have time to

Captain Blood shrugged. â€œIf this is a mere pirating raid, that, of
course, is a prime consideration. It was with me. But if you are
concerned to abate the pride of Spain and plant the Lilies of France

M. de Rivarol bit his lip in chagrin. His gloomy eye smouldered as it
considered the self-contained buccaneer.

M. de Cussy started out of his gloomy abstraction. He cleared his

to undertake this thing, I will myself undertake it. The weather is
calm, and I count upon making good my landing. If I do so, I shall have
proved you wrong, and I shall have a word to say to you to-morrow which

NA
It was sheer obstinacy and empty pride that drove him, and he received
the lesson he deserved. The fleet stood in during the afternoon to
within a mile of the coast, and under cover of darkness three hundred
men, of whom two hundred were negroes--the whole of the negro contingent
having been pressed into the undertaking--were pulled away for the shore
in the canoes, piraguas, and shipsâ€™ boats. Rivarolâ€™s pride compelled
him, however much he may have disliked the venture, to lead them in
person.
The first six boats were caught in the surf, and pounded into fragments
before their occupants could extricate themselves. The thunder of the
breakers and the cries of the shipwrecked warned those who followed,
and thereby saved them from sharing the same fate. By the Baronâ€™s urgent
orders they pulled away again out of danger, and stood about to pick
up such survivors as contrived to battle towards them. Close upon fifty
lives were lost in the adventure, together with half-a-dozen boats
stored with ammunition and light guns.
The Baron went back to his flagship an infuriated, but by no means a
wiser man. Wisdom--not even the pungent wisdom experience thrusts upon
us--is not for such as M. de Rivarol. His anger embraced all things, but
focussed chiefly upon Captain Blood. In some warped process of reasoning
he held the buccaneer chiefly responsible for this misadventure. He went
to bed considering furiously what he should say to Captain Blood upon
the morrow.
He was awakened at dawn by the rolling thunder of guns. Emerging upon
the poop in nightcap and slippers, he beheld a sight that increased his
unreasonable and unreasoning fury. The four buccaneer ships under canvas
were going through extraordinary manoeuvre half a mile off the Boca
Chica and little more than half a mile away from the remainder of the
fleet, and from their flanks flame and smoke were belching each time
they swung broadside to the great round fort that guarded that narrow
entrance. The fort was returning the fire vigorously and viciously. But
the buccaneers timed their broadsides with extraordinary judgment to
catch the defending ordnance reloading; then as they drew the Spaniardsâ€™
fire, they swung away again not only taking care to be ever moving
targets, but, further, to present no more than bow or stern to the fort,
their masts in line, when the heaviest cannonades were to be expected.
Gibbering and cursing, M. de Rivarol stood there and watched this
action, so presumptuously undertaken by Blood on his own responsibility.
The officers of the Victorieuse crowded round him, but it was not until
M. de Cussy came to join the group that he opened the sluices of his
rage. And M. de Cussy himself invited the deluge that now caught him.
He had come up rubbing his hands and taking a proper satisfaction in the
energy of the men whom he had enlisted.
NA
this Captain Blood. Heâ€™ll plant the Lilies of France on that fort before

The Baron swung upon him snarling. â€œHe understands his business, eh? His
business, let me tell you, M. de Cussy, is to obey my orders, and I have
not ordered this. Par la Mordieu! When this is over Iâ€™ll deal with him
NA
NA
â€œJustified it! Ah, parbleu! Can a soldier ever justify acting without
NA
detestation of Captain Blood.
Meanwhile the fight went merrily on. The fort was suffering badly. Yet
for all their manoeuvring the buccaneers were not escaping punishment.
The starboard gunwale of the Atropos had been hammered into splinters,
and a shot had caught her astern in the coach. The Elizabeth was badly
battered about the forecastle, and the Arabellaâ€™s maintop had been
shot away, whilstâ€™ towards the end of that engagement the Lachesis came
reeling out of the fight with a shattered rudder, steering herself by
sweeps.
The absurd Baronâ€™s fierce eyes positively gleamed with satisfaction.
NA
frenzy.
But Heaven didnâ€™t hear him. Scarcely had he spoken than there was a
terrific explosion, and half the fort went up in fragments. A lucky shot
from the buccaneers had found the powder magazine.
It may have been a couple of hours later, when Captain Blood, as
spruce and cool as if he had just come from a levee, stepped upon the
quarter-deck of the Victoriense, to confront M. de Rivarol, still in
bedgown and nightcap.
â€œI have to report, M. le Baron, that we are in possession of the fort
on Boca Chica. The standard of France is flying from what remains of its

M. de Rivarol was compelled to swallow his fury, though it choked
him. The jubilation among his officers had been such that he could not
continue as he had begun. Yet his eyes were malevolent, his face pale
with anger.

to await my orders, lest you should afterwards lack the justification

Blood smiled with a flash of white teeth, and bowed. â€œI shall be glad of

Rivarol was left gaping a moment. Absorbed in his ridiculous anger, he
had considered nothing. But he made a quick recovery. â€œTo my cabin, if

 He waved his hand towards the lagoon, the country flanking it and
the considerable city standing back from the beach. â€œIf it is not a

looked at him sharply, suspecting irony. But the swarthy face was bland,
the keen eyes steady.
NA
Blood pointed out the fort at the mouth of the inner harbour, which was
just barely visible above the waving palms on the intervening tongue of
land. He announced that its armament was less formidable than that
of the outer fort, which they had reduced; but on the other hand, the
passage was very much narrower than the Boca Chica, and before they
could attempt to make it in any case, they must dispose of those
defences. He proposed that the French ships should enter the outer
harbour, and proceed at once to bombardment. Meanwhile, he would land
three hundred buccaneers and some artillery on the eastern side of the
lagoon, beyond the fragrant garden islands dense with richly bearing
fruit-trees, and proceed simultaneously to storm the fort in the rear.
Thus beset on both sides at once, and demoralized by the fate of the
much stronger outer fort, he did not think the Spaniards would offer a
very long resistance. Then it would be for M. de Rivarol to garrison the
fort, whilst Captain Blood would sweep on with his men, and seize
the Church of Nuestra Senora de la Poupa, plainly visible on its hill
immediately eastward of the town. Not only did that eminence afford them
a valuable and obvious strategic advantage, but it commanded the only
road that led from Cartagena to the interior, and once it were held
there would be no further question of the Spaniards attempting to remove
the wealth of the city.
That to M. de Rivarol was--as Captain Blood had judged that it would
be--the crowning argument. Supercilious until that moment, and disposed
for his own prideâ€™s sake to treat the buccaneerâ€™s suggestions with
cavalier criticism, M. de Rivarolâ€™s manner suddenly changed. He became
alert and brisk, went so far as tolerantly to commend Captain Bloodâ€™s
plan, and issued orders that action might be taken upon it at once.
It is not necessary to follow that action step by step. Blunders on
the part of the French marred its smooth execution, and the indifferent
handling of their ships led to the sinking of two of them in the course
of the afternoon by the fortâ€™s gunfire. But by evening, owing largely to
the irresistible fury with which the buccaneers stormed the place from
the landward side, the fort had surrendered, and before dusk Blood and
his men with some ordnance hauled thither by mules dominated the city
from the heights of Nuestra Senora de la Poupa.
At noon on the morrow, shorn of defences and threatened with
bombardment, Cartagena sent offers of surrender to M. de Rivarol.
Swollen with pride by a victory for which he took the entire credit
to himself, the Baron dictated his terms. He demanded that all public
effects and office accounts be delivered up; that the merchants
surrender all moneys and goods held by them for their correspondents;
the inhabitants could choose whether they would remain in the city or
depart; but those who went must first deliver up all their property, and
those who elected to remain must surrender half, and become the subjects
of France; religious houses and churches should be spared, but they must
render accounts of all moneys and valuables in their possession.
Cartagena agreed, having no choice in the matter, and on the next
day, which was the 5th of April, M. de Rivarol entered the city and
proclaimed it now a French colony, appointing M. de Cussy its Governor.
Thereafter he proceeded to the Cathedral, where very properly a Te Deum
was sung in honour of the conquest. This by way of grace, whereafter M.
de Rivarol proceeded to devour the city. The only detail in which the
French conquest of Cartagena differed from an ordinary buccaneering raid
was that under the severest penalties no soldier was to enter the
house of any inhabitant. But this apparent respect for the persons and
property of the conquered was based in reality upon M. de Rivarolâ€™s
anxiety lest a doubloon should be abstracted from all the wealth that
was pouring into the treasury opened by the Baron in the name of the
King of France. Once the golden stream had ceased, he removed all
restrictions and left the city in prey to his men, who proceeded further
to pillage it of that part of their property which the inhabitants who
became French subjects had been assured should remain inviolate. The
plunder was enormous. In the course of four days over a hundred mules
laden with gold went out of the city and down to the boats waiting at
the beach to convey the treasure aboard the ships.
CHAPTER XXVIII. THE HONOUR OF M. DE RIVAROL
During the capitulation and for some time after, Captain Blood and the
greater portion of his buccaneers had been at their post on the heights
of Nuestra Senora de la Poupa, utterly in ignorance of what was taking
place. Blood, although the man chiefly, if not solely, responsible
for the swift reduction of the city, which was proving a veritable
treasure-house, was not even shown the consideration of being called to
the council of officers which with M. de Rivarol determined the terms of
the capitulation.
This was a slight that at another time Captain Blood would not have
borne for a moment. But at present, in his odd frame of mind, and its
divorcement from piracy, he was content to smile his utter contempt of
the French General. Not so, however, his captains, and still less
his men. Resentment smouldered amongst them for a while, to flame
out violently at the end of that week in Cartagena. It was only by
undertaking to voice their grievance to the Baron that their captain was
able for the moment to pacify them. That done, he went at once in quest
of M. de Rivarol.
He found him in the offices which the Baron had set up in the town, with
a staff of clerks to register the treasure brought in and to cast up the
surrendered account-books, with a view to ascertaining precisely what
were the sums yet to be delivered up. The Baron sat there scrutinizing
ledgers, like a city merchant, and checking figures to make sure that
all was correct to the last peso. A choice occupation this for the
General of the Kingâ€™s Armies by Sea and Land. He looked up irritated by
the interruption which Captain Bloodâ€™s advent occasioned.
NA
NA
M. de Rivarol considered him with a faint lift of the eyebrows.
â€œCaptain Blood, I, too, will speak frankly; and you, too, must suffer
it. If there is a mutiny, you and your captains shall be held personally
responsible. The mistake you make is in assuming with me the tone of an
ally, whereas I have given you clearly to understand from the first that
you are simply in the position of having accepted service under me.
Your proper apprehension of that fact will save the waste of a deal of

Blood contained himself with difficulty. One of these fine days, he
felt, that for the sake of humanity he must slit the comb of this
supercilious, arrogant cockerel.

I am concerned with facts; chiefly with the fact that we entered
into definite articles with you. Those articles provide for a certain

NA
NA
A blow in the face could scarcely have taken the Frenchman more aback.
He stiffened, and drew himself up, his eyes blazing, his face of a
deathly pallor. The clerks at the tables laid down their pens, and
awaited the explosion in a sort of terror.
For a long moment there was silence. Then the great gentleman delivered
himself in a voice of concentrated anger. â€œDo you really dare so much,
you and the dirty thieves that follow you? Godâ€™s Blood! You shall answer
to me for that word, though it entail a yet worse dishonour to meet you.
NA
NA
but for my men. It is they who are not satisfied, they who threaten that

NA
NA
â€œNow donâ€™t be rash. My men are within their rights, as you are aware.
They demand to know when this sharing of the spoil is to take place, and
NA
â€œGod give me patience! How can we share the spoil before it has been

â€œMy men have reason to believe that it is gathered; and, anyway, they

to view the treasure itself. They know--you compel me to be blunt--that
the accounts have been falsified. Your books show the spoil of Cartagena
to amount to some ten million livres. The men know--and they are very
skilled in these computations--that it exceeds the enormous total of
forty millions. They insist that the treasure itself be produced and
weighed in their presence, as is the custom among the Brethren of the

NA
NA
â€œWhat do you mean, you rogue? I am a leader of armies, not of plundering

just and therefore uphold, you may look for trouble, and it would not

NA
â€œCome, come, M. le Baron! I warn you of the trouble that a little
prudence may avert. You do not know on what a volcano you are sitting.
You do not know the ways of buccaneers. If you persist, Cartagena will
be drenched in blood, and whatever the outcome the King of France will
NA
That shifted the basis of the argument to less hostile ground. Awhile
yet it continued, to be concluded at last by an ungracious undertaking
from M. de Rivarol to submit to the demands of the buccaneers. He gave
it with an extreme ill-grace, and only because Blood made him realize at
last that to withhold it longer would be dangerous. In an engagement,
he might conceivably defeat Bloodâ€™s followers. But conceivably he might
not. And even if he succeeded, the effort would be so costly to him in
men that he might not thereafter find himself in sufficient strength to
maintain his hold of what he had seized.
The end of it all was that he gave a promise at once to make the
necessary preparations, and if Captain Blood and his officers would wait
upon him on board the Victorieuse to-morrow morning, the treasure
should be produced, weighed in their presence, and their fifth share
surrendered there and then into their own keeping.
Among the buccaneers that night there was hilarity over the sudden
abatement of M. de Rivarolâ€™s monstrous pride. But when the next dawn
broke over Cartagena, they had the explanation of it. The only ships
to be seen in the harbour were the Arabella and the Elizabeth riding
at anchor, and the Atropos and the Lachesis careened on the beach for
repair of the damage sustained in the bombardment. The French ships were
gone. They had been quietly and secretly warped out of the harbour under
cover of night, and three sails, faint and small, on the horizon to
westward was all that remained to be seen of them. The absconding M. de
Rivarol had gone off with the treasure, taking with him the troops and
mariners he had brought from France. He had left behind him at Cartagena
not only the empty-handed buccaneers, whom he had swindled, but also
M. de Cussy and the volunteers and negroes from Hispaniola, whom he had
swindled no less.
The two parties were fused into one by their common fury, and before the
exhibition of it the inhabitants of that ill-fated town were stricken
with deeper terror than they had yet known since the coming of this
expedition.
Captain Blood alone kept his head, setting a curb upon his deep chagrin.
He had promised himself that before parting from M. de Rivarol he would
present a reckoning for all the petty affronts and insults to which that
unspeakable fellow--now proved a scoundrel--had subjected him.
NA
At first that was the general cry. Then came the consideration that
only two of the buccaneer ships were seaworthy--and these could
not accommodate the whole force, particularly being at the moment
indifferently victualled for a long voyage. The crews of the Lachesis
and Atropos and with them their captains, Wolverstone and Yberville,
renounced the intention. After all, there would be a deal of treasure
still hidden in Cartagena. They would remain behind to extort it whilst
fitting their ships for sea. Let Blood and Hagthorpe and those who
sailed with them do as they pleased.
Then only did Blood realize the rashness of his proposal, and in
attempting to draw back he almost precipitated a battle between the two
parties into which that same proposal had now divided the buccaneers.
And meanwhile those French sails on the horizon were growing less and
less. Blood was reduced to despair. If he went off now, Heaven knew what
would happen to the town, the temper of those whom he was leaving being
what it was. Yet if he remained, it would simply mean that his own
and Hagthorpeâ€™s crews would join in the saturnalia and increase the
hideousness of events now inevitable. Unable to reach a decision, his
own men and Hagthorpeâ€™s took the matter off his hands, eager to give
chase to Rivarol. Not only was a dastardly cheat to be punished but
an enormous treasure to be won by treating as an enemy this French
commander who, himself, had so villainously broken the alliance.
When Blood, torn as he was between conflicting considerations, still
hesitated, they bore him almost by main force aboard the Arabella.
Within an hour, the water-casks at least replenished and stowed aboard,
the Arabella and the Elizabeth put to sea upon that angry chase.
NA
Pitt, in his log, â€œI went to seek the Captain, knowing him to be in
great trouble of mind over these events. I found him sitting alone
in his cabin, his head in his hands, torment in the eyes that stared
NA
NA
NA
NA
be that he must vent the thing that oppressed him or be driven mad by
it. And Pitt, after all, was his friend and loved him, and, so, a proper
man for confidences. â€œBut if she knew! If she knew! O God! I had thought
to have done with piracy; thought to have done with it for ever. Yet
here have I been committed by this scoundrel to the worst piracy that
ever I was guilty of. Think of Cartagena! Think of the hell those devils

â€œNay, Peter--â€˜t isnâ€™t on your soul; but on Rivarolâ€™s. It is that dirty
thief who has brought all this about. What could you have done to
NA
NA
NA
NA
Loyal service with the English was made impossible for me. Loyal service
with France has led to this; and that is equally impossible hereafter.
What to live clean, I believe the only thing is to go and offer my sword
NA
But something remained--the last thing that he could have
expected--something towards which they were rapidly sailing over
the tropical, sunlit sea. All this against which he now inveighed so
bitterly was but a necessary stage in the shaping of his odd destiny.
Setting a course for Hispaniola, since they judged that thither must
Rivarol go to refit before attempting to cross to France, the Arabella
and the Elizabeth ploughed briskly northward with a moderately
favourable wind for two days and nights without ever catching a
glimpse of their quarry. The third dawn brought with it a haze which
circumscribed their range of vision to something between two and three
miles, and deepened their growing vexation and their apprehension that
M. de Rivarol might escape them altogether.
Their position then--according to Pittâ€™s log--was approximately 75 deg.
30â€™ W. Long. by 17 deg. 45â€™ N. Lat., so that they had Jamaica on their
larboard beam some thirty miles to westward, and, indeed, away to the
northwest, faintly visible as a bank of clouds, appeared the great ridge
of the Blue Mountains whose peaks were thrust into the clear upper air
above the low-lying haze. The wind, to which they were sailing very
close, was westerly, and it bore to their ears a booming sound which in
less experienced ears might have passed for the breaking of surf upon a
lee shore.
NA
nodded, listening.
â€œTen miles away, perhaps fifteen--somewhere off Port Royal, I should

 he asked.
â€œGuns off Port Royal... that should argue Colonel Bishop at work. And
against whom should he be in action but against friends of ours I think
it may concern us. Anyway, weâ€™ll stand in to investigate. Bid them put
NA
Close-hauled they tacked aweather, guided by the sound of combat, which
grew in volume and definition as they approached it. Thus for an hour,
perhaps. Then, as, telescope to his eye, Blood raked the haze, expecting
at any moment to behold the battling ships, the guns abruptly ceased.
They held to their course, nevertheless, with all hands on deck,
eagerly, anxiously scanning the sea ahead. And presently an object
loomed into view, which soon defined itself for a great ship on fire. As
the Arabella with the Elizabeth following closely raced nearer on their
north-westerly tack, the outlines of the blazing vessel grew clearer.
Presently her masts stood out sharp and black above the smoke and
flames, and through his telescope Blood made out plainly the pennon of
St. George fluttering from her maintop.
NA
He scanned the seas for the conqueror in the battle of which this grim
evidence was added to that of the sounds they had heard, and when
at last, as they drew closer to the doomed vessel, they made out the
shadowy outlines of three tall ships, some three or four miles away,
standing in toward Port Royal, the first and natural assumption was
that these ships must belong to the Jamaica fleet, and that the burning
vessel was a defeated buccaneer, and because of this they sped on to
pick up the three boats that were standing away from the blazing hulk.
But Pitt, who through the telescope was examining the receding squadron,
observed things apparent only to the eye of the trained mariner, and
made the incredible announcement that the largest of these three vessels
was Rivarolâ€™s Victorieuse.
They took in sail and hove to as they came up with the drifting boats,
laden to capacity with survivors. And there were others adrift on some
of the spars and wreckage with which the sea was strewn, who must be
rescued.
CHAPTER XXIX. THE SERVICE OF KING WILLIAM
One of the boats bumped alongside the Arabella, and up the entrance
ladder came first a slight, spruce little gentleman in a coat of
mulberry satin laced with gold, whose wizened, yellow, rather peevish
face was framed in a heavy black periwig. His modish and costly apparel
had nowise suffered by the adventure through which he had passed, and
he carried himself with the easy assurance of a man of rank. Here, quite
clearly, was no buccaneer. He was closely followed by one who in every
particular, save that of age, was his physical opposite, corpulent in
a brawny, vigorous way, with a full, round, weather-beaten face whose
mouth was humourous and whose eyes were blue and twinkling. He was
well dressed without fripperies, and bore with him an air of vigorous
authority.
As the little man stepped from the ladder into the waist, whither
Captain Blood had gone to receive him, his sharp, ferrety dark eyes
swept the uncouth ranks of the assembled crew of the Arabella.
NA
NA
â€œMyself, I have the honour to be Irish, sir. My name is Blood--Captain
Peter Blood, and this is my ship the Arabella, all very much at your

stared back at him. At last: â€œI am alluding to His Majesty King William

There was a momentâ€™s silence, until Blood realized what he was being
told.
â€œDâ€™ye mean, sir, that theyâ€™ve roused themselves at home, and kicked out

Admiral van der Kuylen nudged his lordship, a humourous twinkle in his
blue eyes.

His lordshipâ€™s smile brought lines like gashes into his leathery cheeks.

James was fled to France, and living under the protection of King Louis,
wherefore, and for other reasons, England had joined the league against
her, and was now at war with France. That was how it happened that the
Dutch Admiralâ€™s flagship had been attacked by M. de Rivarolâ€™s fleet
that morning, from which it clearly followed that in his voyage from
Cartagena, the Frenchman must have spoken some ship that gave him the
news.
After that, with renewed assurances that aboard his ship they should
be honourably entreated, Captain Blood led the Governor-General and the
Admiral to his cabin, what time the work of rescue went on. The news
he had received had set Bloodâ€™s mind in a turmoil. If King James was
dethroned and banished, there was an end to his own outlawry for his
alleged share in an earlier attempt to drive out that tyrant. It became
possible for him to return home and take up his life again at the point
where it was so unfortunately interrupted four years ago. He was dazzled
by the prospect so abruptly opened out to him. The thing so filled his
mind, moved him so deeply, that he must afford it expression. In doing
so, he revealed of himself more than he knew or intended to the astute
little gentleman who watched him so keenly the while.
NA
may be sure that none will harass you on the score of your piracy,
considering what it was that drove you to it. But why be in haste? We
have heard of you, to be sure, and we know of what you are capable upon
the seas. Here is a great chance for you, since you declare yourself
sick of piracy. Should you choose to serve King William out here during
this war, your knowledge of the West Indies should render you a very
valuable servant to His Majestyâ€™s Government, which you would not find
ungrateful. You should consider it. Damme, sir, I repeat: it is a great
chance you are given.
NA
at the moment, I confess, I can consider nothing but this great news. It
alters the shape of the world. I must accustom myself to view it as it

Pitt came in to report that the work of rescue was at an end, and the
men picked up--some forty-five in all--safe aboard the two buccaneer
ships. He asked for orders. Blood rose.

Blood stared in surprise a moment; then yielded to laughter.

Mallard whom I found in Port Royal, apparently governing in this foolâ€™s

It was the Dutch Admiral who answered him. â€œVould he go dere if he were

His lordship snarled like a mountain-cat. â€œThat rascal Bishop shall

desertion of his post. What if it were deliberate, eh? What if he is

Captain Blood was generous. â€œHardly so much. It was just vindictiveness
that urged him. Itâ€™s myself heâ€™s hunting at Tortuga, my lord. But, Iâ€™m
thinking that while heâ€™s about it, Iâ€™d best be looking after Jamaica for

wrist, held out a delicate white hand.

CHAPTER XXX. THE LAST FIGHT OF THE ARABELLA
NA
NA
It was the afternoon of that same day, and the two buccaneer ships
rocked gently with idly flapping sails under the lee of the long spit
of land forming the great natural harbour of Port Royal, and less than a
mile from the straits leading into it, which the fort commanded. It was
two hours and more since they had brought up thereabouts, having crept
thither unobserved by the city and by M. de Rivarolâ€™s ships, and all the
time the air had been aquiver with the roar of guns from sea and land,
announcing that battle was joined between the French and the defenders
of Port Royal. That long, inactive waiting was straining the nerves of
both Lord Willoughby and van der Kuylen.
NA
Blood faced them, smiling confidently. He was arrayed for battle, in
back-and-breast of black steel. â€œIâ€™ll not be trying your patience much
longer. Indeed, I notice already a slackening in the fire. But itâ€™s this
way, now: thereâ€™s nothing at all to be gained by precipitancy, and a

Lord Willoughby eyed him suspiciously. â€œYe think that in the meantime
NA
â€œSure, now, Iâ€™m thinking nothing of the kind. What Iâ€™m thinking is that
in this engagement with the fort M. de Rivarol, whoâ€™s a lubberly fellow,
as Iâ€™ve reason to know, will be taking some damage that may make the
odds a trifle more even. Sure, itâ€™ll be time enough to go forward when

He leaned on the carved rail and issued orders crisply. The boâ€™sunâ€™s
pipe shrilled out, and in a moment the ship that had seemed to slumber
there, awoke to life. Came the padding of feet along the decks, the
creaking of blocks and the hoisting of sail. The helm was put over
hard, and in a moment they were moving, the Elizabeth following, ever in
obedience to the signals from the Arabella, whilst Ogle the gunner,
whom he had summoned, was receiving Bloodâ€™s final instructions before
plunging down to his station on the main deck.
Within a quarter of an hour they had rounded the head, and stood in to
the harbour mouth, within saker shot of Rivarolâ€™s three ships, to which
they now abruptly disclosed themselves.
Where the fort had stood they now beheld a smoking rubbish heap, and the
victorious Frenchman with the lily standard trailing from his mastheads
was sweeping forward to snatch the rich prize whose defences he had
shattered.
Blood scanned the French ships, and chuckled. The Victorieuse and the
Medusa appeared to have taken no more than a few scars; but the third
ship, the Baleine, listing heavily to larboard so as to keep the great
gash in her starboard well above water, was out of account.
NA
NA
The sight of that great red ship with her gilt beak-head and open
ports swinging broadside on must have given check to Rivarolâ€™s soaring
exultation. Yet before he could move to give an order, before he could
well resolve what order to give, a volcano of fire and metal burst
upon him from the buccaneers, and his decks were swept by the murderous
scythe of the broadside. The Arabella held to her course, giving place
to the Elizabeth, which, following closely, executed the same manoeuver.
And then whilst still the Frenchmen were confused, panic-stricken by
an attack that took them so utterly by surprise, the Arabella had gone
about, and was returning in her tracks, presenting now her larboard
guns, and loosing her second broadside in the wake of the first.
Came yet another broadside from the Elizabeth and then the Arabellaâ€™s
trumpeter sent a call across the water, which Hagthorpe perfectly
understood.
NA
their wits. Stand by, there! Prepare to board! Hayton ... the grapnels!
And pass the word to the gunner in the prow to fire as fast as he can

He discarded his feathered hat, and covered himself with a steel
head-piece, which a negro lad brought him. He meant to lead this
boarding-party in person. Briskly he explained himself to his
two guests. â€œBoarding is our only chance here. We are too heavily
NA
Of this the fullest demonstration followed quickly. The Frenchmen
having recovered their wits at last, both ships swung broadside on, and
concentrating upon the Arabella as the nearer and heavier and therefore
more immediately dangerous of their two opponents, volleyed upon her
jointly at almost the same moment.
Unlike the buccaneers, who had fired high to cripple their enemies above
decks, the French fifed low to smash the hull of their assailant. The
Arabella rocked and staggered under that terrific hammering, although
Pitt kept her headed towards the French so that she should offer the
narrowest target. For a moment she seemed to hesitate, then she plunged
forward again, her beak-head in splinters, her forecastle smashed, and a
gaping hole forward, that was only just above the water-line. Indeed,
to make her safe from bilging, Blood ordered a prompt jettisoning of the
forward guns, anchors, and water-casks and whatever else was moveable.
Meanwhile, the Frenchmen going about, gave the like reception to the
Elizabeth. The Arabella, indifferently served by the wind, pressed
forward to come to grips. But before she could accomplish her object,
the Victorieuse had loaded her starboard guns again, and pounded her
advancing enemy with a second broadside at close quarters. Amid the
thunder of cannon, the rending of timbers, and the screams of maimed
men, the half-necked Arabella plunged and reeled into the cloud of smoke
that concealed her prey, and then from Hayton went up the cry that she
was going down by the head.
Bloodâ€™s heart stood still. And then in that very moment of his despair,
the blue and gold flank of the Victorieuse loomed through the smoke.
But even as he caught that enheartening glimpse he perceived, too, how
sluggish now was their advance, and how with every second it grew more
sluggish. They must sink before they reached her.
Thus, with an oath, opined the Dutch Admiral, and from Lord Willoughby
there was a word of blame for Bloodâ€™s seamanship in having risked all
upon this gamblerâ€™s throw of boarding.
NA
ye say it was desperate and foolhardy, why, so it was; but the occasion
NA
But they had not yet completely failed. Hayton himself, and a score of
sturdy rogues whom his whistle had summoned, were crouching for shelter
amid the wreckage of the forecastle with grapnels ready. Within seven or
eight yards of the Victorieuse, when their way seemed spent, and their
forward deck already awash under the eyes of the jeering, cheering
Frenchmen, those men leapt up and forward, and hurled their grapnels
across the chasm. Of the four they flung, two reached the Frenchmanâ€™s
decks, and fastened there. Swift as thought itself, was then the action
of those sturdy, experienced buccaneers. Unhesitatingly all threw
themselves upon the chain of one of those grapnels, neglecting the
other, and heaved upon it with all their might to warp the ships
together. Blood, watching from his own quarter-deck, sent out his voice
in a clarion call:
NA
The musketeers, at their station at the waist, obeyed him with the speed
of men who know that in obedience is the only hope of life. Fifty of
them dashed forward instantly, and from the ruins of the forecastle they
blazed over the heads of Haytonâ€™s men, mowing down the French soldiers
who, unable to dislodge the irons, firmly held where they had deeply
bitten into the timbers of the Victorieuse, were themselves preparing to
fire upon the grapnel crew.
Starboard to starboard the two ships swung against each other with a
jarring thud. By then Blood was down in the waist, judging and acting
with the hurricane speed the occasion demanded. Sail had been lowered
by slashing away the ropes that held the yards. The advance guard of
boarders, a hundred strong, was ordered to the poop, and his grapnel-men
were posted, and prompt to obey his command at the very moment of
impact. As a result, the foundering Arabella was literally kept afloat
by the half-dozen grapnels that in an instant moored her firmly to the
Victorieuse.
Willoughby and van der Kuylen on the poop had watched in breathless
amazement the speed and precision with which Blood and his desperate
crew had gone to work. And now he came racing up, his bugler sounding
the charge, the main host of the buccaneers following him, whilst the
vanguard, led by the gunner Ogle, who had been driven from his guns by
water in the gun-deck, leapt shouting to the prow of the Victorieuse, to
whose level the high poop of the water-logged Arabella had sunk. Led now
by Blood himself, they launched themselves upon the French like hounds
upon the stag they have brought to bay. After them went others, until
all had gone, and none but Willoughby and the Dutchman were left to
watch the fight from the quarter-deck of the abandoned Arabella.
For fully half-an-hour that battle raged aboard the Frenchman. Beginning
in the prow, it surged through the forecastle to the waist, where it
reached a climax of fury. The French resisted stubbornly, and they had
the advantage of numbers to encourage them. But for all their stubborn
valour, they ended by being pressed back and back across the decks that
were dangerously canted to starboard by the pull of the water-logged
Arabella. The buccaneers fought with the desperate fury of men who know
that retreat is impossible, for there was no ship to which they could
retreat, and here they must prevail and make the Victorieuse their own,
or perish.
And their own they made her in the end, and at a cost of nearly half
their numbers. Driven to the quarter-deck, the surviving defenders,
urged on by the infuriated Rivarol, maintained awhile their desperate
resistance. But in the end, Rivarol went down with a bullet in his head,
and the French remnant, numbering scarcely a score of whole men, called
for quarter.
Even then the labours of Bloodâ€™s men were not at an end. The Elizabeth
and the Medusa were tight-locked, and Hagthorpeâ€™s followers were being
driven back aboard their own ship for the second time. Prompt measures
were demanded. Whilst Pitt and his seamen bore their part with the
sails, and Ogle went below with a gun-crew, Blood ordered the grapnels
to be loosed at once. Lord Willoughby and the Admiral were already
aboard the Victorieuse. As they swung off to the rescue of Hagthorpe,
Blood, from the quarter-deck of the conquered vessel, looked his last
upon the ship that had served him so well, the ship that had become to
him almost as a part of himself. A moment she rocked after her release,
then slowly and gradually settled down, the water gurgling and eddying
about her topmasts, all that remained visible to mark the spot where she
had met her death.
As he stood there, above the ghastly shambles in the waist of the
Victorieuse, some one spoke behind him. â€œI think, Captain Blood, that it
is necessary I should beg your pardon for the second time. Never before
have I seen the impossible made possible by resource and valour, or
NA
He turned, and presented to Lord Willoughby a formidable front. His
head-piece was gone, his breastplate dinted, his right sleeve a rag
hanging from his shoulder about a naked arm. He was splashed from head
to foot with blood, and there was blood from a scalp-wound that he had
taken matting his hair and mixing with the grime of powder on his face
to render him unrecognizable.
But from that horrible mask two vivid eyes looked out preternaturally
bright, and from those eyes two tears had ploughed each a furrow through
the filth of his cheeks.
CHAPTER XXXI. HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR
When the cost of that victory came to be counted, it was found that of
three hundred and twenty buccaneers who had left Cartagena with Captain
Blood, a bare hundred remained sound and whole. The Elizabeth had
suffered so seriously that it was doubtful if she could ever again be
rendered seaworthy, and Hagthorpe, who had so gallantly commanded her
in that last action, was dead. Against this, on the other side of the
account, stood the facts that, with a far inferior force and by sheer
skill and desperate valour, Bloodâ€™s buccaneers had saved Jamaica from
bombardment and pillage, and they had captured the fleet of M. de
Rivarol, and seized for the benefit of King William the splendid
treasure which she carried.
It was not until the evening of the following day that van der Kuylenâ€™s
truant fleet of nine ships came to anchor in the harbour of Port Royal,
and its officers, Dutch and English, were made acquainted with their
Admiralâ€™s true opinion of their worth.
Six ships of that fleet were instantly refitted for sea. There were
other West Indian settlements demanding the visit of inspection of the
new Governor-General, and Lord Willoughby was in haste to sail for the
Antilles.

â€œYou think so, too, eh? Egad! I had thought of it; and, rip me, why not?
NA
Blood was sent for. He came, spruce and debonair once more, having
exploited the resources of Port Royal so to render himself. He was a
trifle dazzled by the honour proposed to him, when Lord Willoughby made
it known. It was so far beyond anything that he had dreamed, and he was
assailed by doubts of his capacity to undertake so onerous a charge.
NA
NA
â€œIt is not, my lord. I had counted upon going home, so I had. I am

The Admiral raised his brows and pursed his heavy lips. His eyes
twinkled humourously in his great face.

NA
â€œTchah! Thereâ€™s no â€˜butâ€™ to it. If you want your past forgotten, and
your future assured, this is your chance. And you are not to treat it
lightly on account of apple-blossoms or any other damned sentimental
nonsense. Your duty lies here, at least for as long as the war lasts.
When the warâ€™s over, you may get back to Somerset and cider or your
native Ireland and its potheen; but until then youâ€™ll make the best of

Van der Kuylen exploded into laughter. But from Blood the pleasantry
elicited no smile. He remained solemn to the point of glumness. His
thoughts were on Miss Bishop, who was somewhere here in this very house
in which they stood, but whom he had not seen since his arrival. Had she
but shown him some compassion....
And then the rasping voice of Willoughby cut in again, upbraiding him
for his hesitation, pointing out to him his incredible stupidity in
trifling with such a golden opportunity as this. He stiffened and bowed.
â€œMy lord, you are in the right. I am a fool. But donâ€™t be accounting
me an ingrate as well. If I have hesitated, it is because there are

NA
This time Blood laughed, but there was still a lingering wistfulness in
his eyes.
â€œIt shall be as you wish--and very gratefully, let me assure your
lordship. I shall know how to earn His Majestyâ€™s approbation. You may
depend upon my loyal service.
NA
Thus it was settled. Bloodâ€™s commission was made out and sealed in
the presence of Mallard, the Commandant, and the other officers of
the garrison, who looked on in round-eyed astonishment, but kept their
thoughts to themselves.
NA
NA
Blood was startled.
NA
â€œHe becomes your affair. You are now the Governor. You will deal with
him as you think proper on his return. Hang him from his own yardarm. He

NA

Captain Blood took up his duties at once. There was much to be done to
place Port Royal in a proper state of defence, after what had happened
there. He made an inspection of the ruined fort, and issued instructions
for the work upon it, which was to be started immediately. Next he
ordered the careening of the three French vessels that they might
be rendered seaworthy once more. Finally, with the sanction of Lord
Willoughby, he marshalled his buccaneers and surrendered to them one
fifth of the captured treasure, leaving it to their choice thereafter
either to depart or to enrol themselves in the service of King William.
A score of them elected to remain, and amongst these were Jeremy Pitt,
Ogle, and Dyke, whose outlawry, like Bloodâ€™s, had come to an end with
the downfall of King James. They were--saving old Wolverstone, who
had been left behind at Cartagena--the only survivors of that band of
rebels-convict who had left Barbados over three years ago in the Cinco
Llagas.
On the following morning, whilst van der Kuylenâ€™s fleet was making
finally ready for sea, Blood sat in the spacious whitewashed room that
was the Governorâ€™s office, when Major Mallard brought him word that
Bishopâ€™s homing squadron was in sight.

Major Mallard saluted and departed. Peter Blood sat back in his chair
and stared at the ceiling, frowning. Time moved on. Came a tap at the
door, and an elderly negro slave presented himself. Would his excellency
receive Miss Bishop?
His excellency changed colour. He sat quite still, staring at the negro
a moment, conscious that his pulses were drumming in a manner wholly
unusual to them. Then quietly he assented.
He rose when she entered, and if he was not as pale as she was, it was
because his tan dissembled it. For a moment there was silence between
them, as they stood looking each at the other. Then she moved forward,
and began at last to speak, haltingly, in an unsteady voice, amazing in
one usually so calm and deliberate.
NA
NA
he made to steady his voice it sounded harsh and unduly loud.
He saw her start, and stop, and instantly made amends. â€œYou alarm
yourself without reason, Miss Bishop. Whatever may lie between me and
your uncle, you may be sure that I shall not follow the example he has
set me. I shall not abuse my position to prosecute a private vengeance.
On the contrary, I shall abuse it to protect him. Lord Willoughbyâ€™s
recommendation to me is that I shall treat him without mercy. My own

She clenched her hand, and made a little gesture of despair and
impatience.

Her clear hazel eyes considered him a moment wistfully. Then she put out
her hand again.
â€œI am going, Captain Blood. Since you are so generous to my uncle,
I shall be returning to Barbados with him. We are not like to meet
again--ever. Is it impossible that we should part friends? Once I
wronged you, I know. And I have said that I am sorry. Wonâ€™t you... wonâ€™t

He seemed to rouse himself, to shake off a mantle of deliberate
harshness. He took the hand she proffered. Retaining it, he spoke, his
eyes sombrely, wistfully considering her.

â€œNo. He didnâ€™t bungle it. He gave it me in your own words. It touched me
very deeply. It made me see clearly my error and my injustice. I owe

stabbed him like daggers. â€œThese are pirateâ€™s ways, I think! Release

They had, of course, a deal to say thereafter, so much, indeed, that
they sat down to say it, whilst time sped on, and Governor Blood forgot
the duties of his office. He had reached home at last. His odyssey was
ended.
And meanwhile Colonel Bishopâ€™s fleet had come to anchor, and the Colonel
had landed on the mole, a disgruntled man to be disgruntled further yet.
He was accompanied ashore by Lord Julian Wade.
A corporalâ€™s guard was drawn up to receive him, and in advance of
this stood Major Mallard and two others who were unknown to the
Deputy-Governor: one slight and elegant, the other big and brawny.
Major Mallard advanced. â€œColonel Bishop, I have orders to arrest you.

Major Mallard turned away his face that he might conceal his smile, and
without further words led him a prisoner to the Governorâ€™s house, the
house that so long had been Colonel Bishopâ€™s own residence. He was left
to wait under guard in the hall, whilst Major Mallard went ahead to
announce him.
Miss Bishop was still with Peter Blood when Major Mallard entered. His
announcement startled them back to realities.

Colonel Bishop staggered in, and stood waiting.
At the table sat a man of whom nothing was visible but the top of a
carefully curled black head. Then this head was raised, and a pair of
blue eyes solemnly regarded the prisoner. Colonel Bishop made a noise
in his throat, and, paralyzed by amazement, stared into the face of his
excellency the Deputy-Governor of Jamaica, which was the face of the man
he had been hunting in Tortuga to his present undoing.
The situation was best expressed to Lord Willoughby by van der Kuylen as
the pair stepped aboard the Admiralâ€™s flagship.
