TOLD IN THE EAST
HOOKUM HAI
I.
A Blood-red sun rested its huge disk upon a low mud wall that crested
a rise to westward, and flattened at the bottom from its own weight
apparently. A dozen dried-out false-acacia-trees shivered as the
faintest puff in all the world of stifling wind moved through them; and
a hundred thousand tiny squirrels kept up their aimless scampering in
search of food that was not there.
A coppersmith was about the only living thing that seemed to care
whether the sun went down or not. He seemed in a hurry to get a job
NA
sunrise, and had driven nearly mad the few humans who were there to hear
it--quickened and grew louder. At last Brown came out of a square mud
house, to see about the sunset.
He was nobody but plain Bill Brown--or Sergeant William Brown, to give
him his full name and entitlements--and the price of him was two rupees
per day.
He stared straight at the dull red disk of the sun, and spat with
eloquence. Then he wiped the sweat from his forehead, and scratched a
place where the prickly heat was bothering him. Next, he buttoned up
his tunic, and brushed it down neatly and precisely. There was official
business to be done, and a man did that with due formality, heat or no
heat.
NA
Twelve men filed out, one behind the other, from the hut that he had
left. They seemed to feel the heat more than Brown did, as they fell in
line before Brownâ€™s sword. There was no flag, and no flag-pole in that
nameless health-resort, so the sword, without its scabbard, was doing
duty, point downward in the ground, as a totem-pole of Empire. Brown had
stuck it there, like Boanergesâ€™ boots, and there it stayed from sunrise
until sunset, to be displaced by whoever dared to do it, at his peril.
They had no clock. They had nothing, except the uniforms and arms of
the Honorable East India Company, as issued in this year of Our
Lord, 1857--a cooking-pot or two, a kettle, a little money and a
butcher-knife. Their supper bleated miserably some twenty yards away,
tied to a tree, and a lean. Punjabi squatted near it in readiness to buy
the skin. It was a big goat, but it was mangy, so he held only two annas
in his hand. The other anna (in case that Brown should prove adamant)
was twisted in the folds of his pugree, but he was prepared to perjure
himself a dozen times, and take the names of all his female ancestors in
vain, before he produced it.
The sun flattened a little more at the bottom, and began to move
quickly, as it does in India--anxious apparently to get away from the
dayâ€™s ill deeds.
NA
The red sun slid below the sky-line, and the night was on them, as
though somebody had shut the lid. Brown stepped to the sword, jerked it
out of the ground and returned it to his scabbard in three motions.
NA
again, disconsolately, without swearing and without mirth. They had
put the sun to bed with proper military decency. They would have seen
humor--perhaps--or an excuse for blasphemy in the omission of such a
detail, but it was much too hot to swear at the execution of it.
Besides, Brown was a strange individual who detested swearing, and it
was a very useful thing, and wise, to humor him. He had a way of his
own, and usually got it.
Brown posted a sentry at the hut-door, and another at the crossroads
which he was to guard, then went round behind the but to bargain with
the goatskin-merchant. But he stopped before he reached the tree.
NA
run.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAll right. Iâ€™m going to have a talk with him. Kill the goat, and tell
NA
NA
Brown spun round on his heel, and the servant wilted.
NA
Brown left him then, with a nod that conveyed remission of cardinal sin,
and a warning not to repeat the offence. As the native ran off to get
the butcher-knife and sharpen it, it was noticeable that he wore a
chastened look.
NA
nearly naked Beluchi struck a match and emerged from the darkness, with
the light of a lantern gleaming on his skin. He followed like a snake,
and only Brownâ€™s sharp, authority-conveying footfalls could be heard as
he trudged sturdily--straight-backed, eyes straight in front of him--to
where an age-old baobab loomed like a phantom in the night. He marched
like a man in armor. Not even the terrific heat of a Central-Indian
night could take the stiffening out of him.
The Beluchi ran ahead, just before they reached the tree. He stopped and
held the lantern up to let its light fall on some object that was close
against the tree-trunk. At a good ten-pace distance from the object
Brown stopped and stared. The lamplight fell on two little dots that
gleamed. Brown stepped two paces nearer. Two deadly, malicious human
eyes blinked once, and then stared back at him.
NA
The Beluchi said something or other in a language that was full of harsh
hard gutturals, and the owner of the eyes chuckled. His voice seemed
to be coming from the tree itself, and there was nothing of him visible
except the cruel keen eyes that had not blinked once since Brown drew
nearer.
NA
NA
â€œTell him Iâ€™m tired of his not answering. Tell him that if he canâ€™t
learn to give a civil answer to a civilly put question Iâ€™ll exercise my
NA
The Beluchi translated, or pretended to. Brown was not sure which, for
he was rewarded with nothing but another chuckle, which sounded like
water gurgling down a drain.
NA
NA
Brown stepped up closer yet, and peered into the blackness, looking
straight into the eyes that glared at him, and from them down at the
body of the owner of them. The Beluchi shrank away.
â€œHave a care, sahib! It is dangerous! This very holy--most holy--most
NA
NA
NA
NA
The Beluchi came nearer again, trembling with fright. Brown snatched the
lamp away from him, and pushed it forward toward the fakir, moving it
up and down to get a view of the whole of him. There was nothing that
he saw that would reassure or comfort or please a devil even. It was
ultradevilish; both by design and accident--conceived and calculated
ghastliness, peculiar to India. Brown shuddered as he looked, and it
took more than the merely horrible to make him betray emotion.
NA
NA
The fakir chuckled again, and Brown held the lantern yet nearer to him
to get a better view. The fakirâ€™s skin was not oily, and for all the
blanket-heat it did not glisten, so his form was barely outlined against
the blackness that was all but tangible behind him.
Brown spat again, as he drew away a step. He could contrive to express
more disgust and more grim determination in that one rudimentary act
than even a Stamboul Softa can.
NA
NA
Again the fakir chuckled, and again Brown held his breath and pushed the
lantern closer to him.
NA
â€œHe understanding all things, sahib! He knowing all things what will
NA
But Brown appeared indifferent to the danger that he ran. To the fakirâ€™s
unconcealed discomfort, he proceeded to examine him minutely, going over
him with the aid of the lantern inch by inch, from the toe-nails upward.
NA
Iâ€™d give a monthâ€™s pay for the privilege of washing this brute, just as
NA
The manâ€™s toe-nails--for he really was a man!--were at least two inches
long. They were twisted spirally, and some of them were curled back on
themselves into disgusting-looking knots. What walking he had ever done
had been on his heels. His feet were bent upward, and fixed upward, by a
deliberately cultivated cramp.
His legs, twisted one above the other in a squatting attitude, were lean
and hairy, and covered with open sores which were kept open by the swarm
of insects that infested him. His loin-cloth was rotting from him. His
emaciated body--powdered and smeared with ashes and dust and worse--was
perched bolt-up-right on a flat earth dais that had once on a time been
the throne of a crossroads idol. One arm, his right one, hung by
his side in an almost normal attitude, and his right fingers moved
incessantly like a manâ€™s who is kneading clay. But his other arm was
rigid--straight up in the air above his head; set, fixed, cramped,
paralyzed in that position, with the fist clenched. And through the back
of the closed fist the fakirâ€™s nails were growing.
But, worse than the horror of the arm was the creatureâ€™s face, with
the evidence of torture on it, and fiendish delight in torture for the
tortureâ€™s sake. His eyes were his only organs that really lived still,
and they expressed the steely hate and cruelty, the mad fanaticism,
the greedy self-love--self-immolating for the sake of self--that is the
thoroughgoing fakirâ€™s stock in trade. And his lips were like the
graven lips of a Hindu temple god, self-satisfied, self-worshiping,
contemptuous and cruel. He chuckled again, as Brown finished his
inspection.
â€œSo that critturâ€™s holy, is he? Well, tell him that Iâ€™m set here to
watch these crossroads. Tell him Iâ€™m supposed to question every one who
comes, and find out what his business is, and arrest him if he canâ€™t
give a proper account of himself. Say heâ€™s been here three days now, and
that thatâ€™s long enough for any one to find his tongue in. Tell him if I
NA
NA
NA
The Beluchi made haste to translate, trembling as he spoke, and wilting
visibly when the baleful eyes of the fakir rested on him for a second.
The fakir answered something in a guttural undertone.
NA
NA
NA
NA
as the man on guard at the crossroads shouldered it. There are some men
NA
sergeants who receive a colonelâ€™s share of deference when out on a
non-commissioned officerâ€™s command. Bill Brown was one of them.
NA
There came the sound of heavy footfalls, and a thud as a rifle-butt
descended to the earth again. Brown moved the lamp, and its beams fell
on a rifleman who stood close beside him at attention--like a jinnee
formed suddenly from empty blackness.
NA
NA
The sentry took one step forward, with his fixed bayonet at the
NA
NA
NA
The bayonet-point pressed against the fakirâ€™s ribs, and he drew back an
inch or two to get away from it. He was evidently able to feel pain when
it was inflicted by any other than himself.
NA
NA
NA
NA
The sentry swung his rifle round with an under-handed motion that all
riflemen used to practise in the short-range-rifle days. The fakir
winced, and gabbled something in a hurry to the man who held the lamp.
NA
NA
The Beluchi translated, and the fakir answered him, in a voice that
sounded hard and distant and emotionless.
â€œHe says that he, too, is here to watch the crossroads, sahib! He says
NA
NA
NA
NA
The rifle leaped up at the word, and its butt landed neatly on the
fakirâ€™s ribs, sending him reeling backward off his balance, but not
upsetting him completely. He recovered his poise with quite astonishing
activity, and shuffled himself back again to the center of the dais. His
eyes blazed with hate and indignation, and his breath came now in sharp
gasps that sounded like escaping steam. He needed no further invitation
to commence his cursing. It burst out with a rush, and paused for better
effect, and burst out again in a torrent. The Beluchi hid his face
between his hands.
NA
of breath.
NA
Brown took a threatening step toward him, and the Beluchi changed his
mind. Brownâ€™s disciplining methods were a too recently encountered fact
to be outdone by a fakirâ€™s promise of any kind of not-yet-met damnation.
â€œSahib, he says that because your man has touched him, both you and
your man shall lie within a week helpless upon an anthill, still living,
while the ants run in and out among your wounds. He says that the ants
shall eat your eyes, sahib, and that you shall cry for water, and there
shall be no water within reach--only the sound of water just beyond you.
He says that first you shall be beaten, both of you, until your backs
and the soles of your feet run blood, in order that the ants may have an

The Beluchi passed the question on, and the fakir tossed him an answer
to it.
NA
â€œSo the gods obey his orders, do they. Well, theyâ€™ve a queer sense of

NA
NA
â€œHe says, sahib, that for countless centuries you and your man shall
inhabit the carcasses of snakes, to eat dirt and be trodden on and

NA
NA
â€œIt wonâ€™t make much difference, then, what I do now. If thatâ€™s in store
for me in any case, I may as well get my moneyâ€™s worth before the fun
begins! Tell him that unless he can give me a satisfactory reason for
being here I shall treat him to a little more rifle-butt, and something
NA
NA
fakir, â€œthat he is here to see what the gods have prophesied. He says
NA
NA
NA
NA
Brown looked about him and, save where the lantern cast a fitful light
on the fakir and the sentry and the native servant, and threw into faint
relief the shadowy, snake-like tendrils of the baobab, his eyes
failed to pierce the gloom. The sunset was a memory. In that heavy,
death-darkness silence it seemed almost as though there had never been a
sun.
â€œâ€˜A blot of blood,â€™ he says. He says the order has been given. He says
that half of India shall run blood within a day, and the whole of it
NA
NA
â€œHe answers â€˜Hookum hai!â€™--which means â€˜It is an order!â€™ Nothing more

NA
Shipton babblings. Thatâ€™s the third useless Hindu fanatic within a week
who has talked about India being drenched in blood. Let him go in to the
NA
The sentryâ€™s rifle-butt rose again and threatened business. The Beluchi
gave a warning cry, and the fakir tumbled off his dais. Then, with the
trembling Beluchi walking on ahead with the lantern, and Brown and the
sentry urging from behind, the fakir jumped and squirmed and wabbled
on his all but useless feet toward the guardroom. When they reached the
tree where the goat had bleated, the Punjabi skin-buyer rose up, took
one long look at the fakir and ran.
NA
NA
anywhere where Iâ€™m about! Iâ€™ll not have it, dâ€™you hear? Get on ahead,
NA
The sentry obeyed him, and a moment later the fakir was thrust into a
four-square mud-walled room, and the door was locked on him.
NA
swearing, Iâ€™ll treat you to a double-trick, my man! About turn. Quick
NA
The sentry trudged off without daring to answer him, and Brown took a
good look at the fakir through the iron bars that protected the top
half of the door. Then he went off to see about his supper, of newly
slaughtered goat-chops and chupatties baked in ghee. His soul revolted
at the thought of it, but it was his duty to eat it and set an example
to the men; and duty was the only thing that mattered in Bill Brownâ€™s
scheme of things.
NA
knowing. Maybe Indiaâ€™s going to run blood, as these fakirs seem to
think, and maybe it isnâ€™t. Thereâ€™ll be more blood shed than mine in that
case! â€˜Hookum haiâ€™--â€˜It is orders,â€™ heh? Well--thereâ€™s more than one
NA
He doubled the guard, when supper bad been eaten and the guardroom had
been swept and the pots and kettle had been burnished until they shone.
Then he tossed a chupatty to the imprisoned fakir, spat again from sheer
disgust, lit his pipe and went and sat where he could hear the footbeats
of the sentries.
NA
know no better. And theyâ€™ve got a right to think what they please â€˜about
me or the Company. But Iâ€™ve no patience with uncleanliness! Thatâ€™s wrong
any way you look at it. That critter canâ€™t see straight for the dirt on
him, nor think straight for that matter. Heâ€™s a disgrace to humanity.
Priest or fakir or whatever he is, if I live to see tomorrowâ€™s sun Iâ€™ll
NA
Having formed that resolution, Brown dismissed all thoughts of the
fakir. His memory went back to home--the clean white cottage on the
Sussex Downs, and the clean white girl who once on a time had waited for
him there. For the next few hours, until the guard was changed, the only
signs or sounds of life were the glowing of Brownâ€™s pipe, the steady
footfalls of the sentries and occasional creakings from the hell-hot
guard-room, where sleepless soldiers tossed in prickly discomfort.
II.
Bill Brown, with his twelve, had not been set to watch a lonely
crossroad for the fun of it. One road was a well-made highway, and led
from a walled city, where three thousand men sweated and thought
of England, to another city, where five thousand armed natives drew
Englandâ€™s pay, and wore English uniforms.
The other road was a snake-like trail, nearly as wide but not nearly
so well kept. It twisted here and there amid countless swarming native
villages, and was used almost exclusively by natives, whose rightful
business was neither war nor peace nor the contriving of either of them.
It had been a trade-road when history was being born, and the laden
ox-carts creaked along it still, as they had always done and always will
do until India awakes.
But there are few men in the world who attend to nothing but their
rightful business, and there are even more in India than elsewhere
who are prone to neglect their own affairs and stir up sedition among
others. There are few fighting-men among that host. They are priests
for the most part or fakirs or make-believe pedlers or confessed and
shameless mendicants; and they have no liking for the trunk roads,
where the tangible evidence of Might and Majesty may be seen marching in
eight-hundred-man battalions. They prefer to dream along the byways, and
set other people dreaming. They lead, when the crash comes, from behind.
Though the men who made the policies of the Honorable East India Company
were mostly blind to the moving finger on the wall, and chose to imagine
themselves secure against a rising of the millions they controlled; and
though most of their military officers were blinder yet, and failed to
read the temper of the native troops in their immediate command, still,
there were other men who found themselves groping, at least two years
before the Mutiny of â€˜57. They were groping for something intangible and
noiseless and threatening which they felt was there in a darkness, but
which one could not see.
Baines was one of them--Lieutenant-General Baines, commanding at
Bholat. His troops were in the center of a spiderâ€™s web of roads that
criss-crossed and drained a province. There were big trunk arteries,
which took the flow of life from city to walled city, and a mass of
winding veins in the shape of grass-grown country tracks. He could feel,
if any man could, the first faint signs of fever rising, and he was
placed where he could move swiftly, and cut deep in the right spot,
should the knife be needed.
He was like a surgeon, though, who holds a lancet and can use it, but
who lacks permission. The poison in Indiaâ€™s system lay deep, and the
fever was slow in showing itself. And meanwhile the men who had the
ordering of things could see neither necessity nor excuse for so much as
a parade of strength. They refused, point-blank and absolutely, to admit
that there was, or, could be, any symptom of unrest.
He dared not make new posts for officers, for officers would grumble at
enforced exile in the country districts, and the Government would get to
hear of it, and countermand. But there were non-commissioned officers
in plenty, and it was not difficult to choose the best of them--three
men--and send them, with minute detachments, to three different points
of vantage. Non-commissioned officers donâ€™t grumble, or if they do no
one gets to hear of it, or minds. And they are just as good as officers
at watching crossroads and reporting what they see and hear.
So where a little cluster of mud huts ached in the heat of a right
angle where the trunk road crossed a native road some seventy miles from
Bholat, Bill Brown--swordsman and sergeant and strictest of martinets,
as well as sentimentalist--had been set to watch and listen and report.
There were many cleverer men in the non-commissioned ranks of Baineâ€™s
command, many who knew more of the native languages, and who had
more imagination. But there was none who knew better how to win the
unqualified respect and the obedience of British and native alike,
or who could be better counted on to obey an order, when it came,
literally, promptly and in the teeth of anything.
Brownâ€™s theories on religion were a thing to marvel at, and walk
singularly wide of, for he was a preacher with a pair of fists when
thoroughly aroused. And his devotion to a girl in England whom no one
in his regiment had ever seen, and of whom he did not even possess a
likeness, was next door to being pitiable. His voice was like a ravenâ€™s,
with something rather less than a ravenâ€™s sense of melody; he was very
prone to sing, and his songs were mournful ones. He was not a social
acquisition in any generally accepted sense, although his language was
completely free from blasphemy or coarseness. His ideas were too cut
and dried to make conversation even interesting. But his loyalty and his
sense of duty were as adamant.
He had changed the double guard at the crossroads; and had posted two
fresh men by the mud-walled guardroom door. He had lit his pipe for the
dozenth time, and had let it go out again while he hummed a verse of a
Covenantersâ€™ hymn. And he had just started up to wall over to the cell
and make a cursory inspection of his prisoner, when his ears caught a
distant sound that was different from any of the night sounds, though
scarcely louder.
Prompt as a rifle in answer to the trigger, he threw himself down on
all fours, and laid his ear to the ground. A second later, he was on his
feet again.
NA
Cots squeaked and jumped, and there came a rush of hurrying feet. The
eight men not on watch ran out in single file, still buttoning their
uniforms, and lined up beside the two who watched the guardroom door.
NA
finding his way in the blackness more by instinct and sense of direction
than from any landmark, for even the road beneath his feet was barely
visible.
NA
asked the sentries.
Both men listened intently, and presently one of them made out a very
faint and distant noise, that did not seem to blend in with the other
night-sounds.
NA
NA
Tired horse, by the sound of him, and coming this way. All right,
NA
â€œOne of you go two hundred yards along the road, and form an
advance-post, so to speak. Challenge him the minute heâ€™s within
ear-shot, and shoot him if he wonâ€™t halt. If he halts, pass him along to
Number Two. Number Two, pass him along to the guardroom, where
Iâ€™ll deal with him! Which of youâ€™s Number One? Number One,
NA
The sentry trudged off in one direction, and Bill Brown in another. The
sentry concealed itself behind a rock that flanked the road, and
NA
carefully inspecting their weapons with the aid of a lantern. He had
already inspected there once since supper, but he knew the effect that
another inspection would be likely to produce. Nothing goes further
toward making men careful and ready at the word than incessant and
unexpected but quite quietly performed inspection of minutest details.
He produced the effect of setting the men on the qui vive without
alarming them.
Suddenly, the farthest advanced sentryâ€™s challenge rang out.
NA
galloping continued.
NA
were little sounds, but they were different, and the guard could hear
them plainly. The galloping horse came on.
NA
for an instant across the road, like a sheet of lightning. And, just
as lightning might, it showed an instantaneous vision of a tired
gray horse, foam-flecked and furiously ridden, pounding down the road
head-on. The vision was blotted by the night again before any one could
see who rode the horse, or what his weapons were--if any--or form a
theory as to why he rode.
But the winging bullet did what the sentryâ€™s voice had failed to do.
There came a clatter of spasmodic hoof-beats, an erratic shower of
sparks, a curse in clean-lipped decent Urdu; a grunt, a struggle, more
sparks again, and then a thud, followed by a devoutly worded prayer
that Allah, the all-wise provider of just penalties, might blast the
universe.
NA
and looked up to find a bayonet-point within three inches of his eye.
NA
NA
to nothing else. Put up your â€˜ands, and get on your feet, and march!
Look alive, now! Call me a fool, would yer? Wait till the sergeantâ€™s
NA
The Rajput chose to consider a retort beneath his dignity. He rose, and
took one quick look at the horse, which was still breathing.
NA
The sentry placed his bayonet-point exactly where directed, and leaned
his weight above it. The horse gave a little shudder, and lay still.
NA
and saw cold steel within three inches of his eye!
NA
And, to save his eyesight, the sentry complied, while the Rajputâ€™s
ivory-white teeth grinned at him pleasantly.
NA
with his own bayonet at his back the sentry had to march, whether
he wanted to or not, by the route that the other chose, toward the
guardroom. The Rajput seemed to know by instinct where the second sentry
stood although the manâ€™s shape was quite invisible against the night. He
NA
first sentryâ€™s footsteps, imagined that the real situation was reversed.
So, out of a pall of blackness, to the accompanying sound of rifles
being brought up to the shoulder, a British sentry--feeling and looking
precisely like a fool--marched up to his own guardroom, with a man who
should have been his prisoner in charge of him.
NA
NA
recognized.
He stepped up closer, to make sure.
NA
â€œAye, Brown sahib! Juggut Khan--with tidings, and a dead gray horse on
which to bear them! If this fool could only use his bayonet as he can
shoot, I think I would be dead too. His brains, though, are all behind
his right eye. Tie him up, where no little child can come and make him
NA
NA
the end of the guard, and stood him between them, behind the line.
NA
ill grace.
NA
â€œOh, easily! You English are only brave; you have no brains. Sometimes
one part of the rule is broken, but the other never. You are not always
NA
NA
â€œI am angry, Brown sahib, for greater happenings than that! The man
conceivably was right, since I did not halt for him, and I suppose he
had his orders. I am angry because the standard of rebellion is raised,
NA
NA
â€œYour honor is pleased to be humorous? No, I am not drunk. Nor have I
eaten opium. I have eaten of the bread of bitterness this day, and drunk
of the cup of gall. I have seen British officers--good, brave fools,
some of whom I knew and loved--killed by the men they were supposed
to lead. I have seen a barracks burning, and a city given over to be
looted. I have seen white women--nay, sahib, steady!--I have seen them
run before a howling mob, and I have seen certain of them shot by their

NA
â€œOne of them I slew myself, because her husband, who was wounded, sent
me to her and bade me kill her. She died bravely. And certain others
I have hidden where the mutineers are not likely to discover them at
present. I ride now for succor--or, I rode, rather, until your expert

than that, sahib. Mohammedans and Hindus are as one, and the crowd is
with them. This is probably the end of the powder-train, for, from what
I heard shouted by the mutineers, almost the whole of India is in revolt
NA
NA
â€œGod knows, sahib! The reason given is that the cartridges supplied are
greased with the blended fat of pigs and cows, thus defiling both Hindu
and Mohammedan alike. But, if you ask me, the cause lies deeper. In the
meantime, the rebels have looted Jailpore and burned their barracks, and
within an hour or two they will start along this road for Bholat, which
they have a mind to loot likewise. My advice to you is retire at once.
Get me another horse from somewhere, that I may carry warning. Then
NA
NA
NA
â€œWho knows yet how many in Bholat have not risen? Are you positive that
the garrison there has not already been surrounded by rebels? I am not!
I would not be at all surprised to learn that General Baines is so busy
defending himself that he can not move in any direction. And--does your

But Brown was doing mathematics in his head. Two men to guard prisoners,

The Rajput strode along beside him, and gave him some additional
information as they went, Brown taking very good care all the time to
keep out of earshot of the men and to speak to Juggut Khan in low tones.
He learned, among other things, that Juggut Khan had lost every anna
that he owned, and had only escaped with his life by dint of luck and
swordship and most terrific riding.

III.
The finding of a remount for Juggut Khan was not so troublesome as might
have been supposed. The rumors and plans and whispered orders for the
coming struggle had been passed around the countryside for months past,
and every man who owned a horse had it stalled safely near him, for use
when the hour should come.
There were country-ponies and Arabs and Kathiawaris and Khaubulis among
which to pick, and though the average run of them was worse than merely
bad, and though both best and worst were hidden away whenever possible,
good horses were discoverable. Within an hour, Bill Brown; with the aid
of his men, had routed out a Khaubuji stallion for Juggut Khan, one fit
to carry him against time the whole of the way to Bholat.
The Rajput mounted him where Brown unearthed him, and watched the
signing of a scribbled-out receipt with a cynical smile.

He drove his right spur in, wheeled the horse and started across country
in the direction of Bholat at a hand-gallop, guiding himself solely
by the soldierâ€™s sixth sense of direction, and leaving the problem of
possible pitfalls to the horse.

The men came clustering round him now, anxious for an explanation.
They had held their tongues while Juggut Khan was there, because they
happened to know Brown too well to do otherwise. He would have snubbed
any man who dared to question him before the Indian. But, now that the
Indian was gone, curiosity could stay no longer within bounds.
â€œWhat is it, Sergeant? Anything been happening? Whatâ€™s the news? Whatâ€™s
that I heard him say about rebellion? Theyâ€™re a rum lot, them Rajputs.
NA
â€œListen, then. Rebellion has broken out. The native barracks at Jailpore
have been burned, and all the English officers are killed--or so says
Juggut Khan. Heâ€™s riding on, to carry the news to General Baines. He
says that the mutineers are planning to come along this way some time

He marched them back toward the crossroads without giving them any
further opportunity to remonstrate or ask for information.
It was not until he reached the crossroads, without being challenged,
that he showed any sign of being in any way disturbed.
NA
But there was no answer.
NA
blackness swallowed him, but the men could hear him move, and they heard
him fall. They heard him muttering, too, within ten paces of them. Then
they heard his order.
NA
One man produced a piece of candle, struck a match and lit it. A moment
later they had all broken order, and were standing huddled up together
like a frightened flock of sheep, peering through dancing, candle-lit
shadows at something horrible that Brown was handling.

Both of the guards lay dead. They lay quite neatly, side by side,
without a sign about them to show that they had met with violence. Brown
rolled one body over, though, and then the cause of death became more
obvious. A stream of blood welled out of the manâ€™s back, from between
the shoulder-blades--warm blood, that had not even started to coagulate.

The procession advanced toward the guardhouse in grim silence, and once
again there was no challenge when there should have been. The lamp was
still burning in the guardroom, for they could see it plainly as they
drew nearer, but there was no noise of a sentryâ€™s footfalls, or hoarse

the bodies with a sheet before commencing to investigate.
He started off toward the cell where he had imprisoned the fakir. He
went by himself, and no one volunteered to go with him.
He had gone five yards when the second explanation met his eyes. This
time there was no need to stoop down, nor to turn any body over. The
sentry whom he had left to guard both cell and guardroom stood bolt
upright, with his mouth and his eyes wide open; skewered to the wall of
the guardhouse by an iron spike, which pierced his chest.

the guardroom beside the others. How? How should I know? Pull it out, or

He walked on toward the cell-door, while they labored, and fingered
gingerly around the spike, which must have been driven through the
sentryâ€™s chest with a hammer.

The door of the cell stood open, and there was no sign of any fakir, or
of any one who might have helped him go--nothing but an empty cell, with
the haunting smell of the fakir still abiding in it.
Bill Brown spat, and closed the cell-door.
NA
â€œThings look right, donâ€™t they, if thatâ€™s so! Obey, Obey! Iâ€™d have liked
to see England just once again--I would indeed. If I could only see her
just once. If Iâ€™d a letter from her, or her picture. This is a rotten,

He overtook the men who were carrying in the nail-killed sentry, and he
saw that their faces were drawn and white. So were those of the other
men, who were clustered in the guardroom door.

He glared at them for just about one minute before he spoke, and during
that minute each man there realized that what was coming would be quite
irrevocable.
â€œIâ€™m sergeant here. My orders are to hold this post until relieved.
Therefore--and I hope thereâ€™s no man here holds any other notion; I hope
it for his own sake!--until we are relieved, weâ€™re going to hold it!
Moreover, this command is going to be a real command, from now on. Itâ€™s
going to buck up. Iâ€™m going to put some ginger in it. There are three
dead men here to be avenged, and Iâ€™m going to avenge â€˜em, or make you

IV.
An Indian city that has yet to have its mysterieâ€™s laid bare and
banished by electric light is a stage deliberately set for massacre. The
bazaars run criss-crosswise; any way at all save parallel, and anyhow
but straight. Between them lies always a maze of passages, and alleys,
deep sided, narrow, overhung by trellised windows and loopholed walls
and guarded stairways.
For every square inch where the sun can shine there are a hundred where
a man could hide unseen. Through century piled on suspicious century, no
designer, no architect, no builder has neglected to provide a means of
secret ingress, and still more secret egress, to each new house. And the
newest house is built on secret passages that hid conspirators against
the kings of men who lived before the oldest house was thought of.
After the Mutiny of â€˜57 came broader roads--so that a cannon might be
trained along them.
But in â€˜57, Jailpore was a nest of winding alley-ways and blind bat
and rat holes, where weird smells and strange unlisted poisons and
prophecies were born. In its midst, tight-packed in a roaring babel-din
of many-colored markets, stood a stone-walled palace, built once by a
Hindu king to commemorate a victory over Moslems, added to by a Moslem
Nizam, to celebrate his conquest of the Hindus and added to once again
by the Honorable East India Company, to make a suitable barracks for its
native troops.
From the rat-infested slums, from the hot shadows and the mazy
back-bazaars, from temples, store-houses, shops, and from the
sin-steeped underworld, there screamed and surged and swept the
many-graded, many-minded polyglot rebellion-spume. A quarter of a
million underdogs had turned against their masters. A hundred factions
and as many more religions, all had one common end in view--to loot. All
were agreed on one thing--that the first stage of the game must be to
turn Jailpore and, after Jailpore, India, into a charnel-house.
Around and around the burning palace the mob screamed and swept
uncontrolled. Moslem looted Hindu, and Hindu Moslem. Armed sepoys,
with the blood of their British officers fresh-soaked on their British
NA
pockets, danced weird, wild devil-dances through the streets, clearing
their way, when they saw fit, with cold steel or wanton volleys. Women
screamed. Caste looted caste. Loose horses galloped madly through the
streets. Here and there a pitched battle raged, where a merchant who had
wealth had also courage, and apprentices and friends to help him defend
his store.
And through all the din and clamor, under and above the howling and
the volleys and the roar of flames, sounded the steady thumping of
the sacred war-drums. The whole sky glowed red. The Indian night was
scorched and smoked and lit by arson. Hell screamed with the cooking of
red mutiny, and throbbed with the thunder of the sacred temple-drums.
And that was only one of the hells, and a small one. India glowed red
that night from end to end!
Juggut Khan, free-lance Rajput and gentleman of fortune, had ridden out
of that caldron of Jailpore. His house was a heap of glowing ashes, and
his goods were tossed for and distributed among a company. But his mark
lay indelibly impressed upon the town. There were three European women
and a child who were nowhere to be found; and there was a trail that led
from somewhere near the palace to the western gate. It was a red trail.
In one spot lay a sepoy pierced through by a lance, and with half of the
lance-shaft still standing upright in him. That had been bad art--sheer
playing to the gallery! Juggut Khan had run him through and tried to
lift him on the lance-end for a trophy. It was luck that saved the day
for him that time, not swordsmanship.
But a man who has done what he had done that day may be forgiven. There
lay nine other men behind him where his lance was left, and each of them
lay face upward with a round red hole in his anatomy where the lance had
entered.
And from the point where he had broken his lance and left it, up to
where a self-appointed guard had refused at first to open the city gate
for him, there was a trail that did honor to the man who taught him
swordsmanship. One man lay headless, and anotherâ€™s head was only part of
him, because the sword had split it down the middle and the two halves
were still joined together at the neck.
There were men who claimed afterward that of the twenty-three who lay
between his lance-shaft and the city gate, some five or six had been
slain in brawls and looting forays. And Juggut Khan was never known
to discuss the matter. But the fact remains that every man of them was
killed by the blade or point of a cavalry-saber, and that Juggut Khan
broke out of the place untouched.
And another fact worthy of record is, that underneath a stone floor, in
a building that was partly powder-magazine-surrounded at every end and
side by mutineers who searched for them, and very nearly stifled by the
dust of decaying ages--there lay three women and a child, with a jar of
water close beside them and a sack of hastily collected things to eat.
They lay there in all but furnace-heat, close-huddled in the darkness,
and they shuddered and sobbed and blessed Juggut Khan alternately.
Below them the whispering echoes sighed mysteriously through a maze of
tunnels. Around them, and around their sack of food, the rats scampered.
Above them, where a ten-ton stone trapdoor lay closed over their heads,
black powder stood in heaps and sacks and barrels. Closing the trapdoor
had been easy. One pushed it and it fell. Not all the mutineers in
Jailpore nor Juggut Khan nor any one could open it again without the
secret. And no man living knew the secret. The three women and the child
were safe from immediate intrusion!
Those three women and that child were not so exceptionally placed for
India, of that date. Two of the women had seen their husbands slain
that afternoon, before their eyes. They were mother and daughter and
grandson; and the fourth was an English nurse, red-cheeked still from
the kiss of English Channel breezes.

ridiculous, unenlightened. It was a hardship to them, to be endured with

General Baines was in a position to be envied. No soldier worthy of his
salt is other than elated at the thought of war. Now for the proving
of his theories. Now for the fruit of all his tireless preaching and
inspection and preparing--the planned, pegged-out swoop to victory!
He knew--as few men in India knew--the length and the breadth of what
was coming. And when two of his non-commissioned officers sent in word
that the whole country was ablaze, he realized, as few other men did
in that minute, that this was no local outbreak. The long-threatened
holocaust had come, and he had to act, to smite, to strike sure and
swift at the festering root of things, or Central India was lost.
But his hands were tied still. He knew. He could see. He could feel.
He could hear. But he had his orders. That very morning they had been
repeated to him, and with emphasis. In a letter from the Council he had
been told that â€œslight disturbances, of a purely local character, were
not without the bounds of possibility, due partly to religious unrest
and partly to local causes. Under no circumstances were any extended
reprisals to be undertaken until further orders, and generals commanding
districts were required to keep the bulk of their commands within

The countryside was up. All India probably was up. His own men, set by
himself to watch with one definite idea, had confirmed his worst fears.
And he was under orders to stay with the bulk of his command in Bholat!
Corked up in cantonments, with three thousand first-class fighting-men
squealing for trouble, and red rebellion running riot all around him
though it might be quelled by instant action!
And then worse happened. Juggut Khan clattered in to Bholat, spurring
a horse that was so spent it could barely keep its feet. It fell in a
woeful heap outside the generalâ€™s quarters, and Juggut Khan--all but as
weary as the horse--swung himself free, staggered past the sentry at the
door and rapped with his hilt on the tough teak panel. They had to give
him brandy and feed him before he could summon strength enough to tell
what he had seen and heard and done.

Now if Sergeant Brown possessed a sweetheart, and the sweetheart lived
in England, and if Brown still loved her--as has already been more
than hinted at--it is not at all unreasonable to wonder why he had no
likeness of her, no news of her, nothing but her memory around which
to weave the woof of sentiment--at least, itâ€™s not unreasonable so to
wonder in this late year of grace.
Then, though, in 1857, when a newspaper cost threepence or thereabouts,
and schools were so far from being free that only the sons of gentlemen
(and seldom the daughters of even gentlemen, remember) attended them,
the art of reading was not so common as it now is. Writing was still
more uncommon. And it has not been pretended that Brown was other than a
commoner. He was a stiff-backed man, and honest. And the pride that had
raised him to the rank of sergeant was even stiffer than his stock. But
he came from the ranks that owned no vote, nor little else, in those
days, and he owned a sweetheart of the same rank as himself, who could
neither read nor write. And when people whose somewhat primitive ideas
on right and wrong lead them to look on daguerreotypes as works of the
devil happen too to be living more than five thousand miles apart, when
one of the two can not write, nor readily afford the cost of postage,
and when the other is nearly always on the move from post to post, it is
not exactly to be wondered at that memory of each other was all they had
to dwell upon.
A journey to India in â€˜57 meant, to the rank and file, oblivion and
worse. There were men then, of course, just as there are now, who would
leave a girl behind them tied fast by a promise of futile and endless
devotion; men who knew what the girls did not know--that India was all
but inaccessible to any one outside of government employ, and that a
common soldierâ€™s chance of sending for his girl, or of coming home
again to claim her, was something in the neighborhood of one in thirty
thousand.
But there were other men, like William Brown, who were a shade too
honest and too stiff-chinned to buckle under to the social conditions
of England in those days, and who were consequently not exactly pestered
with offers of employment. And a man who could see the difference
between doffing his ragged cap to a dissolute squire or parson, and
saluting his better on parade, could also see the selfishness of leaving
an honest girl to languish for him. Brown could not get a living in
England. So he told his girl to get a better man, swung his canvas bag
across his shoulder and marched away.

like Bill seem to have a knack of judging character, and of picking
girls who are as steadfast as themselves. So it is not to be wondered at
that almost before her tears were dry she had set about attempting what
few women of her type and time would have dreamed of. If Bill had set
her free, she reasoned, Bill had no more authority over her, and she
might do exactly what she chose. Bill could release, but he could not
make her take another man. So, for all that the local yeomen, and local
tradesmen even, haunted the little cottage on the Downs, and pestered
her with their attentions, no one supplanted Bill.
Bill could tell her--and had told her--that India was no country for a
white woman; that there were snakes there, and black men and tigers and
even worse. But, since he had set her free, if she could manage it
she was quite at liberty to brave the tigers and the snakes. And, once
there, she would see whether she was free or not, and whether Bill was,
either!
It took Bill Brown six years of constant honest effort to become a
sergeant. It took Jane Emmett six weeks of pride-consuming and vexatious
vigilance to procure for herself a job as nurse in a soldier-family. And
it took her six more years of unremitting diligence, sweetened by all
the attributes that seem desirable when nursing other peopleâ€™s children
and embittered by the shame of grudging patronage, before she was
considered dependable enough to be recommended for the service of a
family just leaving for Bengal. Then, however, her world was a real
world again!
Five months on a sailing-ship around the Cape--deep-laden, gunwales
NA
Agul--has, while the clumsy brigantine rolled the masts loose in her,
all but dismasted in a typhoon come astray from the China Sea, fed on
moldy bread, and even moldier pork, with a fretful child to nurse, and
an exacting mother to be pleased! Jane Emmett laughed at it. Bill had
been there before her, and had done more on his way, and worse Bengal
did not frighten her. Nor did the knowledge, when she reached it, that
Bill was very likely still some hundreds of miles away. She, who had
come five thousand miles as the crows are said to fly and nine thousand
by the map, could manage the odd hundreds. And she could wait. She had
waited six long years. What was another month or two?
She had not even a notion where Bill was, beyond a vague one that he
belonged to another province. For when the Honorable East India Company
was muddling the affairs of India, the honors and emoluments and
privileges--such as they were!--were reserved for the benefit of the
commissioned ranks.
So a transfer to Jailpore did not mean to Jane Emmett ten extra degrees
of heat, the neighborhood of jungle-fever and a brand-new breed of
smells. Those disadvantages, which weighted down the souls of her
employers, were completely overshadowed, so far as she was concerned, by
the knowledge that she was traveling nearer by a hundred leagues or so
to where her Bill was stationed. She was going west; and somewhere
to the west was Bill. Anything was good--fever, and prickly heat, and
smells included--that brought her any nearer him.
There would be no sense in endeavoring to analyze her sensations when
the sudden outburst overwhelmed the inner-guard at Jailpore. The sight
of white women being butchered, and of white men with the blood of their
own women on their hands, selling their lives as dearly as the God
of War would let them in a holocaust of flames, blinded her. It was
probably just a splurge of fire and noise and smoke and blood in her
memory, with one or two details standing out. The only real sensation
that she felt--even when a tall, lean Rajput flung her across his
shoulder, ran with her and dropped her down through a square hole into
stifling darkness--was a longing for Bill Brown, her Bill, the one man
in the world who could surely stop the butchery.
The others prayed. But she refused to pray. She felt angry--not
prayerful! Had she come nine thousand miles, and sacrificed six good
years of youth and youthâ€™s heritage, to be cast into a reeking dungeon
and left to die there in the dark? Not if Bill should know of it! And
so she changed her argument, and prayed for Bill. If only Bill
knew--straight-backed, honest, stiff-chinned, uncompromising, plain Bill
Brown. He would change things!

VII.
When a man knows what is out against him, and from which direction he
may look to meet death, he only needs to be a very ordinary man to
make at least a gallant showing. Gallery or no gallery to watch, given
responsibility and trained men under hire, not one man in a thousand
will fail to face death with dignity.
But Brown knew practically nothing, and understood still less, of what
was happening. He had Juggut Khanâ€™s word for it that Jailpore was in
flames, and that all save four of its European population had been
killed. He believed that to be a probably exaggerated statement of
affairs, but he did not blink the fact that he might expect to be
overwhelmed almost without notice, and at any minute. That was a fact
which he accepted, for the sake of argument and as a working-basis on
which to build a plan of some kind--His orders were to hold that post,
and he would hold it until relieved by General Baines or death. But
there are several ways of holding a hot coal besides the rather obvious
one of sitting on it.
It would have been a fine chance to be theatrical, had play-acting been
in his line. Many and many a full-blown general has risen to authority
and fame by means of absolutely useless gallery-play. He believed that
he would presently be relieved by General Baines, who he felt sure would
march at once on Jailpore; and had he chosen to he could have addressed
the men, have set them to throwing up defenses and have made a nice
theatrical redoubt that he could have held quite easily with the help
of nine men for a day or two. And since the really worthwhile things go
often unrewarded, but the gallery-plays never, nobody would have blamed
him had he chosen some such course as that.
But Brownâ€™s idea of holding down a place was to make that place a thorn
in the side of the enemy. And since he did not know who was the enemy,
or where he was, nor why he was an enemy, nor when he would attack, he
proposed to find out these things for himself preparatory to making the
said enemy as uncomfortable as his meager resources would permit, when
NA
He buried the three men whom Fate had seemed to value at the price of a
fakirâ€™s freedom. And, being a religious man, to whom religion was a fact
and the rest of the universe a theory, he was able to say a full funeral
service over them from memory. He said it at the grave-end, with a
lantern in his hand and one man facing him across the grave--as the
English used to drink when the Danes had landed, each watching for the
glint of steel beyond the otherâ€™s shoulder.
And, four on each side of the trench that they had dug, the remainder
knelt and faced the night each way--partly from enforced piety, and
partly because eight men back to back, with their bayonets outward
and their butts against their knees, are an awkward proposition for an
enemy. They mumbled the responses because Brown made them do it, and
they kept their eyes skinned because the night seemed full of other
eyes, and sounds.

his task, â€œyou can get your sleep by fours. I donâ€™t care which four of
you goes to sleep first, but there are only two watches of us left, and
there are about four hours left to sleep in, by my reckoning. Thatâ€™s two
hoursâ€™ sleep for each man. And weâ€™ll keep clear of the guardroom. As
I understand my orders, the important pointâ€™s the cross-roads. Iâ€™m
supposed to halt every one who comes, and to ask him his business. And
thatâ€™d be impossible to do from the guardroom here. Let this be a lesson
to you men, now. In interpretinâ€™ orders, when a pointâ€™s in doubt, always
look for the meaning of the orders rather than the letter of them,
obeying the letter only when the meaning and the letter are the same
thing. The letter of our orders says the guardroom. The meaningâ€™s clear.
Weâ€™re here to guard the cross-roads. We take the meaning, and let the
letter hang!
â€œBesides! The way it seems to me, if thereâ€™s any more trouble cooking
in this neighborhood, itâ€™s going to cook pretty fast, and itâ€™s going
to boil around that guardroom; and if weâ€™re not in the guardroom, why,
thatâ€™s point number one for us! Leave the guardroom lantern lighted, and
bring out nothing but your cartridge-pouches and the box of ammunition.
NA
They obeyed him on the run, afraid to be out of his sight for a moment
even, trusting him as little children trust a nurse, and ready to do
anything so long as he would only keep them up and doing, and not make
them stay by the scene of the murders. Brown knew their state of mind
as accurately as he knew the range of their service rifles, and he knew
just how he could best keep panic from them. He knew too, if not what
was best to do, at least what he intended doing, and he knew how he
could best get them in a state to do it.
Behind his own mind lay all the while a sense of loneliness and
hopelessness. He did not entertain the thought of failure to hold the
crossroads, and he was so certain that General Baines would come with
his division that he could almost see the advance-guard trotting toward
him down the trunk road. But there is no accounting for a soldierâ€™s
moods, and something told him--something deep down inside him that he
could neither name nor understand--that he was out now on the adventure
of a lifetime, and that the heart-cord which had held him tight to
England all these years had been cut. He felt gloomy and dispirited, but
not a man of the nine who followed him had the slightest inkling of it.
He halted them outside the guardroom, and bullydamned two of them
because some unimportant part of their accouterments was missing; and
NA
until he had them jumping at the word. Then he marched them two abreast
in and out among the huts in search of any sign of native servants. They
found no sign of any one at all. Though in that black darkness it would
have been quite possible for half a hundred men to lie undetected. Brown
decided that the camp was empty. He thought it probable that any one
concealed there would have tried his luck on somebody at least, at close
range as he passed.
So he marched them back to the guard-room once again, and sent two
of them in to drag out the shivering Beluchi, who had taken cover
underneath a cot and refused to come out until he was dragged out by the
leg. The nativeâ€™s terror served to pull the men together quite a little,
for Tommy Atkins always does and always did behave himself with pride
when what he is pleased to consider his inferiors are anywhere about.
They showed that unfortunate Beluchi how white men marched into the
darkness--best foot foremost; without halt or hesitation, when ghosts or
murderers or unseen marksmen were close at hand.
The Beluchi let himself be dragged, trembling, between two of them. It
was he who first saw something move, or heard some one breathe. For he
was absolutely on edge, and had nothing to attend to but his own fear.
The others had to keep both eyes and ears lifting, to please Brown the
exacting. The Beluchi struggled and held back, almost breaking loose,
and actually tearing his loin-cloth.
NA
NA
Something told him what it was that moved, and his own skin felt
goose-fleshy from neck to heel.
NA
There was a murmur through the ranks, a sibilant indrawing of the
breath.
NA
Nobody answered him. All nine men stood stock-still, leaning on their
rifles, their heads craned forward and their eyes strained in the
direction of the gloomy baobab.
NA
There was no response. They stood there fixed like a row of chickens
staring at a snake!
NA
He leaped at them, and broke the first rule of the service--as a man may
when he is man enough, and the alternative would be black shame.
His fist was a hard one and heavy, and they felt the weight of it.
â€œForm single rank! Take one pace open order! Extend! Now, forward--by

He marched in front of them, and they followed him for very shame, now
that he had broken their paralysis.

He was peering at something in the dark, something that chuckled and
smelled horrible, and sat unusually still for anything that lived.

They were standing now on three sides of a square. The fourth side
was the trunk of the baobab. Between them and the trunk, the streaming
tendrils swayed and swung, bats flitted and something still invisible
sat still and chuckled.
NA
They could see now. The fakir sat and stared at them and grinned. Brown
raised the lamp and let its rays fall on him. The light glinted off his
eyes, and off the only other part of him that shone--the long, curved,
ghastly fingernails that had grown through the palm of his upstretched
hand.
NA
that fright would take possession of himself as well as of his men, but
quite well aware that the fakir would not answer him. Then he remembered
the Beluchi.
NA
The Beluchi found his tongue, and stammered out a question. The fakir
chuckled, and following his chuckle let a guttural remark escape him.
NA
NA
There was a little laughter from the men at that sally. It takes
very little in the way of humor to dispel a sense of the uncanny or
mysterious.
â€œHe answers, sahib, that you have seen what comes of striking him. He

NA
â€œHe says he cares not, sahib! He says that he has promised what shall

NA
The fakir chuckled at that question, and let out suddenly a long, low,
hollow-sounding howl, like a she-wolfâ€™s just at sundown. He was answered
by another howl from near the guardroom, and every soldier faced about
as though a wasp had stung him.
NA
NA
NA
â€œVery well. Now tell him that unless he obeys my orders on the jump,
word for word as I give them, Iâ€™ll hang him as high as Haman by
that withered arm of his, and have him beaten on the toenails with
a cleaning-rod before I fill him so full of bayonet-holes that the
vulturesâ€™ll take him for a sponge! Say Iâ€™m a man of my word, and donâ€™t

The Beluchi translated.
NA

NA
â€œNow itâ€™s my turn to give him one. Men! Weâ€™ll have to give up that
sleep I talked about. This limping dummy of a fakir thinks heâ€™s got us
frightened, and weâ€™ve got to teach him different. Thereâ€™s some reason
why weâ€™re not being attacked as yet. Thereâ€™s something fishy going on,
and this swabâ€™s at the bottom of it! We want him, too, on a charge of
murder, or instigating murder, and the guardroomâ€™s the best place for
him. To the guardroom with him. Heâ€™ll do for a hostage anyhow. And where
he is, Iâ€™ve a notion that the control of this treachery wonâ€™t be
far away! Grab him below the arms and by the legs. One of you hold
a bayonet-point against his ribs. The rest, face each way on guard.
NA
The fakir howled. Ululating howls replied from the surrounding night,
and once a red light showed for a second and disappeared in front of
them. Then the fakir howled again.
NA
It was the Beluchi who saw it first--the one who was most afraid of
things in general and the least afraid of Sergeant Brown. A little flame
had started in the thatch.

His last words were cut off short by the sound of rifle-fire. Each rifle
in turn barked out, and three rifles answered from the night.
NA
The fakir cursed between his teeth, in proof of prompt obedience by one
of the men who held him.
NA
The Beluchi translated, and the fakir howled again. The flames leaped
through the thatch, and in a minute more the countryside was lit for
half a mile or more by the glare of the burning guardroom.
The flames betrayed more than a hundred turbaned men, who hugged the
shadows.
â€œKeep that bayonet-point against his ribs. See? That comes oâ€™ moving
instead oâ€™ sitting still! If weâ€™d shut ourselves in the guardroom there,
weâ€™d have been merrily roasting in there now! We stole a march on them.

VIII.
Of course, discussing matters in the light of history, with full and
intimate knowledge of everything that had a bearing on the Mutiny, there
are plenty of club-armchair critics who maintain that England could not
do otherwise than win in â€˜57. They always do say that afterward of the
side that won the day.
But then, with history yet to make, things looked very different, and
nobody pretended that there was any certainty of anything except a
victory for the mutineers. All that either side recognized as likely to
reverse conditions was the notorious ability that a beaten and cornered
British army has for upsetting certainties. So the rebels had more
than a little argument as to what steps should be taken next, once the
initial butchery and loot had taken place.
For instance, in Jailpore
More than a hundred fakirs and wandering priests and mendicants had
sent in word that the province from end to end was ready, and that the
British slept. But there were those in Jailpore who distrusted fakirs
and religious votaries of every kind. They believed them fully capable
of rousing the countryside, of working on the religious feelings of the
unsophisticated rustics and setting them to murdering and plundering
right and left. But they doubted their ability to judge of the armyâ€™s
sleepiness. These doubters were the older men, who had had experience
of Englandâ€™s craft in war. They knew of the ability of some at least of
Englandâ€™s generals to match guile against guile, and back up guile with
swift, unexpected hammer-strokes.
There were men who claimed that what had happened in Jailpore would be
repeated in Bholat and elsewhere. There was no need, these maintained,
to march and join hands with other rebels. Each unit was sufficient to
itself. Each city would be a British funeral pyre. Why march?
Some said, â€œThe general at Bholat will learn of the massacre, and will
learn too, that not quite all were killed. He will come hotfoot to find
the four we could not find. For these British are as cobras; slay the
he cobra and the she one comes to seek revenge. Slay the she one and
beware! Her husband will track thee down, and strike thee. They are not
NA
There were other factions that maintained that General Baines was strong
enough, with his three thousand, to hold Bholat, unless the men of
Jailpore marched, to join hands with the Bholatis--who were surely in
revolt by this time. There were others who declared that he would leave
Bholat and Jailpore to their fates without any doubt at all, and would
march to join hands with the nearest contingent, at Harumpore.
The bolder spirits of this latter faction were for setting off at once
to prevent this combination. For a little while their arguments almost
prevailed.
But another faction yet, and an even more numerous one, insisted it were
best to wait for news from other centers.
Why march, they argued, why strike, why run unnecessary risks, before
they knew what was happening elsewhere?
NA
unaccounted for. Some attempt will be made to find and rescue them. But
if we find and slay them, and send their heads to Bholat, then will the
English know that they are indeed dead. Then there will be no attempt at
NA
That piece of logic won the day for a while, and parties were made up
to explore the place, and search in every nook and cranny for the three
women. and a child who surely had not passed out through any of the
gates, and who were therefore just as surely in the city. A reward was
offered by the committee of rebel-leaders and, although nobody believed
that the reward would actually be paid, the opportunities for looting
privately while searching were so great that the search was thorough.
It failed, though, for the very simple reason that nobody suspected that
the huge stone trap-door in the floor of the powder-magazine had ever
been opened, or ever could be opened. The magazine had been a white
manâ€™s watch. White men had kept guard over it for more than a hundred
years, and the natives had forgotten that a maze of tunnels and caverns
lay beneath it.
So, while bayonet-points and swords were pushed into crevices, while
smoke was sent down passages and tunnels and great, loose-limbed,
slobbering hounds were led on the leash and cast to find a trail, the
three women and the child lay still beneath the piled-up powder,
and doled out water, and biscuit in siege-time measures. They lay in
pitch-darkness, in a vault where not even a sound could reach them,
except the whispered echo of their own voices and the scampering of
the rats. They were growing nearly blind, and nearly crazed, with the
darkness and the silence and the fear.
Every second they expected to see daylight through the cracks above, as
rebels levered up the door, or to hear feet and voices coming through
the vaults below, for doubtless the vaults led somewhere. But for their
fear of snakes and rats and unknown horrors, they would have tried to
find a way through the vaults themselves. But as each movement that they
made, and each word that they spoke, sent echoes reverberating through
the gloom, they lay still and shuddered.
Once they heard footsteps on the stone flags overhead. But the footsteps
went away again, and then all was still. Soon they lost all count of
time. They were only aware of heat and discomfort and fear and utter
weariness.
One woman and an infant wept. One woman prayed aloud incessantly. The
third woman--the menial, the worst educated and least enlightened of
the three, according to the othersâ€™ notion of it--stubbornly refused to
admit that there was not some human means of rescue.
NA
And in the darkness that surrounded her she felt that she could see
Billâ€™s face, as she remembered it--red-cheeked and clean-shaven--six
years or more ago.
IX.
The blazing roof of the guardroom lit up even the crossroads for a
while, and Brown and his men could see that for the present there was a
good wide open space between them and the enemy. The firelight showed a
tree not far from the crossroads, and since anything is cover to men who
are surrounded and outnumbered, they made for that tree with one accord,
and without a word from Brown.
NA
NA
He held up one frayed end of a manila rope, that was wound around the
tree-trunk. Some tethered ox had rendered them that service.
â€œFifty feet of good manila, and a fakir that needs hanging! Anybody see
NA
There was a chorus of ready laughter, and the two men who had the
unenviable task of carrying the fakir picked him up and tossed him to
the tree-trunk. The roof of the guardhouse was blazing fiercely, and now
they had fired the other roofs. The fakir, the tree and the little bunch
of men who held him prisoner were as plainly visible as though it had
been daytime. A bullet pinged past Brownâ€™s ear, and buried itself in the
tree-trunk with a thud.

A rifleman obeyed, and the fakir howled aloud. An answering howl from
somewhere beyond the dancing shadows told that the fakir had been
understood.

bight of the rope in the hollow of his left hand, and climbs the tree,
waiting on the first branch suitable for the last sound of the word

over the bough of the tree and descends smartly to the ground, landing
on the balls of his feet and coming to attention. At the word four, the
remainder seize the loose end of the rope, being careful to hold it in
such a way that the fakir has a chance to breathe. And at the last
sound of the word five, you haul all together, lifting the fakir off the

fakir had to strain his chin upward in order to draw his breath.

The men were lined out in single file, each with his two hands on the
rope. Not half of them were really needed to lift such a wizened load as
the fakir, but Brown was doing nothing without thought, and wasting not
an effort. He wanted each man to be occupied, and even amused. He wanted
the audience, whom he could not see, but who he knew were all around him
in the shadows, to get a full view of what was happening. They might
not have seen so clearly, had he allowed one-half of the men to be
lookers-on.

There was a commotion in the shadows, and somewhere in the neighborhood
of fifty men appeared, keeping at a safe distance still, but evidently
anxious to get nearer.
â€œNow talk to the fakir, and not so loudly! Ask him â€˜Are you a sacred

NA
NA
NA
The answer made an opening for an interminable discussion, of the kind
that fakirs and their kindred love. But Brown was not bent just then on
dissertation. He changed his tactics.
â€œDo you want to die, a little slowly, before all those obedient
worshipers of yours, and in such a way that they will see and understand
NA
The Beluchi repeated the question in the guttural tongue that apparently
the fakir best understood. In the fitful light cast by the burning
roofs, it was evident that the fakir had been touched in the one weak
spot of his armor.
There can scarcely be more than one reason why a man should torture
himself and starve himself and maim and desecrate and horribly defile
himself. At first sight, the reason sounds improbable, but consideration
will confirm it. It is vanity, of an iron-bound kind, that makes the
wandering fakir.
NA
But again the fakir did not answer.
â€œTell him that Iâ€™m going to let him save his face, provided he saves
mine. Explain that I, too, have men who think I am something more than
NA
The Beluchi interpreted, and Brown thought that the fakirâ€™s eyes gleamed
with something rather more than their ordinary baleful light. It might
have been the dancing flames that lit them, but Brown thought he saw the
dawn of reason.
â€œSay that if I let my men kill him, my men will believe me superhuman,
and his men will know that he is only a man with a withered arm!
But tell him this: Heâ€™s got the best chance he ever had to perform
a miracle, and have the whole of this province believe in him
NA
Again the fakirâ€™s eyes took on a keener than usual glare, as he listened
to the Beluchi. He did not nod, though, and he made no other sign,
beyond the involuntary evidence of understanding that his eyes betrayed.
â€œHis men can see that noose round his neck, tell him. And his men know
me, more or less, and British methods anyhow. They believe now, theyâ€™re
sure, theyâ€™re positive that his neckâ€™s got about as much chance of
escaping from that noose as a blind cow has of running from a tiger. Now
then! Tell him this. Let him come the heavy fakir all he likes. Tell
him to tell his gang that heâ€™s going to give an order. Let him tell them
that when he says â€˜Hookum hai!â€™ my menâ€™ll loose his neck straight away,
and fall down flat. Only, first of all heâ€™s got to tell them that he
needs us for the present. Let him say that heâ€™s got an extra-special
awful death in store for us by and by, and that heâ€™s going to keep us
by him until heâ€™s ready to work the miracle. Meantime, nobodyâ€™s to touch

The fakir listened, and said nothing. At a sign from Brown the rope
tightened just a little. The fakir raised his chin.
â€œAnd tell him that, if he doesnâ€™t do what I say, and exactly what I say,
and do it now, heâ€™s got just so long to live as it takes a man to choke

The fakir answered nothing.
NA
The fakir lost his balance, and had to scramble to his feet and stand
there swaying on his heels, clutching at the rope above him with his one
uninjured hand, and sawing upward with his head for air. There came a
murmur from the shadows, and a dozen breech-bolts clicked. There seemed
no disposition to lie idle while the holiest thing in a temple-ridden
province dangled in mid-air.

The fakirâ€™s voice, rose in a high-pitched, nasal wail, and from the
darkness all around them there came an answering murmur that was like
the whispering of wind through trees. By the sound, there must have been
a crowd of more than a hundred there, and either the crowd was sneaking
around them to surround them at close quarters, or else the crowd was
growing.
NA

â€œListen, now! And if he says one word except what I told him he might

Brown swung the Beluchi out in front of him where he could hear the
fakir better.

The fakir paused a second from his high-pitched monologue, and a murmur
from the darkness answered him.

The rope tightened just a little--just sufficiently to keep the fakir
cognizant of its position. The fakir howled out a sort of singsong
dirge, which plainly had imperatives in every line of it. At each
short pause for breath he added something in an undertone that made the
Beluchi strain his ears.
â€œHe says, sahib, that they understand. He says, â€˜Now is the time!â€™ He
says now he will order â€˜Hookum hai!â€™ He says, â€˜Are you ready?â€™ He says,

of a superhuman power. The flame from the burning roofs was dying down
already, for the thatch burned fast, and the glowing gloom was deep
enough to hide indifferent acting. With their lives at stake, though,
men act better than they might at other times.
The fakir spun round on his heels and, clutching with his whole hand at
the rope, began to execute a sort of dance--a weird, fantastic, horrible
affair of quivering limbs and rolling eyeballs, topped by a withered arm
that pointed upward, and a tortured fingernail-pierced fist that nodded
on a dried-out-wrist-joint.

The fakirâ€™s wailing continued for a while. With his own hand he took the
noose from his neck and, now that the flames had died away to nothing
but spasmodic spurts above a dull red underglow, there was no one in
the watching ring who could see Brownâ€™s sword-point. Only Brown and
the fakir knew that it was scratching at the skin between the fakirâ€™s
shoulder-blades.

The fakir raised his voice into a howl--a long, low, ululating howl like
that he had uttered when they found him on his dais. From the distance,
beyond the range of rifles, came a hundred answering howls. The fakir
waited, and a minute later a hundred howls were raised again, this time
from an even greater distance.
Then he spoke.

The weird procession crawled and crept and sidled back to where it had
started from not so long before--jumping at every sound, and at every
shadow that showed deeper than the coal-black night around them. It took
them fifteen minutes to recross a hundred yards. But when they reached
the earthen throne again at last, and had hoisted the fakir back in
position on it, there had been no casualties, and the morale of the men
in Sergeant Brownâ€™s command was as good again as the breech-mechanism of
the rifles in his charge.
They were scarcely visible to him or one another in the blackness,
but he sensed the change in them, and changed his own tune to fit the
changed condition.
His voice had nothing in it but the abrupt military explosion when he
gave his orders now--no argument, no underlying sympathy. He was no
longer herding a flock of frightened children. He was ordering trained,
grown men, and he knew it and they knew it. The orders ripped out, like
the crack of a droverâ€™s whip.
â€œFall in, now, properly! â€˜Tshun! Right dress! To two paces--open
order--from the center--extend! Now, then! Left and right wings--last

They were standing so when the pale sun greeted them, in hollow square,
with their backs toward the fakir, who was squatting, staring straight
in front of him, on his dais, with his back turned to the tree and his
withered arm still pointing up to heaven like a dead manâ€™s calling to
the gods for vengeance.
A little later, Brown made each alternate man lie down and get what
sleep he could just where he was, with a comrade standing over him. He
himself slept so for a little while. But one of the men heard something
move among the hanging tendrils of the baobab, investigated with his
bayonet-point, and managed to transfix a twelve-foot python. After that
there was, not so much desire for sleep. The fakir either slept with his
eyes open or else dispensed with sleep. No one seemed able to determine
which.
When the day grew hotter, and the utterly remorseless Indian sun
bore down on them, and on the aching desolation of the plain and the
burnt-out guardhouse, the fakir still sat unblinking, gazing straight
out in front of him, with eyes that hated but did nothing else. He
seemed to have no time nor thought nor care for anything but hate and
the expression of it.
At noon, three little children came to him, and brought him water in a
small brass bowl, and cooked-up vegetables wrapped in some kind of leaf.
Brown let him have theirs, and bribed the frightened children to go and
bring water for the men and himself. He gave them the unheard-of wealth
of one rupee between them, and they went off with it--and did not come
back.
Meanwhile the fakir had drunk his water, and had poured out what was
left. He had also eaten what the children had brought him, and suddenly,
from vacant, implacable hatred, he woke up and began to be amused.

The sound of a galloping horse grew nearer; a horse hard-ridden, that
was none the less sure-footed still, and going strong in spite of sun
and heat. Suddenly a foam-flecked black mare swung round a bend between
two banks, and the sun shone on a polished saber-hilt. A turbaned
Rajput rose in his stirrups, gazed left and right and then in front of
him--from the burned-out guardhouse to the baobab--drew rein to a walk
and waved his hand.

It is not easy to give any kind of real impression of India twenty-four
hours after the outbreak of the mutiny. Movement was the keynote of
the picture--stealthy, not-yet-quite-confident pack-movement on the one
hand, concentrated here and there in blood-red eddies, and, on the other
hand, swift, desperate marches in the open.
The moment that the seriousness of the outbreak had been understood, and
NA
officer strained every nerve at once to strike where a blow would
have the most effect. There was no thought of anything but action, and
offensive, not defensive action. Until some one at the head of things
proved still to be alive, and had had time to form a plan, each
divisional commander acted as he saw fit. That was all that any one was
asked to do at first: to act, to strike, to plunge in headlong where the
mutiny was thickest and most dangerous, to do anything, in fact; except
sit still.
Even with the evidence of mutiny and treachery on every side, with red
flames lighting the horizon and the stench of burning villages on every
hand, the strange Anglo-Saxon quality persisted that has done more even
that the fighting-quality to teach the English tongue to half the world.
The native servants who had not yet run away retained their places
still, unquestioned. When an Englishman has once made up his mind to
trust another man, he trusts him to the hilt, whatever shade of brown or
red or white his hide may be.
But, since every rule has its exceptions, there were some among the
native servants, who remained ostensibly loyal to their masters, who
would better have been shot or hanged at the first suggestion of
an outbreak. For naturally a man who is trusted wrongly is far more
dangerous than one who is held in suspicion. But it never was the
slightest use endeavoring to persuade an average English officer that
his own man could be anything but loyal. He may be a thief and a liar
and a proved-up rogue in every other way; but as for fearing to let him
sleep about the house, or fearing to let him cook his masterâ€™s food,
or fearing to let him carry firearms--well! Perhaps, it is conceit, or
maybe just ordinary foolishness. It is not fear!
So, in a country where the art of poisoning has baffled analysts since
analysts have been invented, and where blood-hungry fanatic priests,
both Hindu and Mohammedan, were preaching and promising the reward
of highest heaven to all who could kill an Englishman or die in the
attempt, a native cook whose antecedents were obscured in mystery cooked
dinner for a British general, and marched with his column to perform the
same service while the general tried to trounce the cookâ€™s friends and
relatives!
But General Baines felt perfectly at ease about his food. He never gave
a thought to it, but ate what was brought to him, sitting his horse most
likely, and chewing something as he rode among the men, and saw that
they filled their bellies properly. He had made up his mind to march on
Harumpore, and to take over the five-hundred-strong contingent there.
Then he could swoop down on any of a dozen other points, in any one of
which a blow would tell.
He was handicapped by knowing almost too much. He had watched so long,
and had suspected for so long that some sort of rebellion was brewing
that, now that it had come, his brain was busy with the tail-ends of
a hundred scraps of plans. He was so busy wondering what might be
happening to all the other men subordinate to him, who would have to be
acting on their own initiative, that his own plans lacked something of
directness. But there was no lack of decision, and no time was lost. The
men marched, and marched their swiftest, in the dust-laden Indian heat.
And he marched with them, in among them, and ate what the cook brought
him, without a thought but for the best interests of the government he
served.
So they buried General Baines some eighty-and-twenty miles from
Harumpore, and shot the cook. And, according to the easy Indian
theology, the cook was wafted off to paradise, while General Baines
betook himself to hell, or was betaken. But the column, three thousand
perspiring Britons strong, continued marching, loaded down with
haversacks and ammunition and resolve.
It was met, long before the jackals had dug down to General Bainesâ€™
remains, by the advance-guard of Colonel Kendrickâ€™s column, which was
coming out of Harumpore because things were not brisk enough in that
place to keep it busy. Kendrick himself was riding with the cavalry
detachment that led the way southward.

punish them, or else weâ€™ll all die in the attempt! If we have to raze

find the four Europeans supposed to be left alive there, our duty is

Ten minutes later a dull roar rose up through a steel-shot dust-cloud,
and three thousand helmets whirled upward, flashing in the sun. Three
thousand weary men had given him his answer! There was no kind of handle
to it; no reserve--nothing but generous and unconditional allegiance
unto hunger, thirst, pain, weariness, disease or death. It takes a real
commander to draw that kind of answer from a tired-out column, but it
is a kind of answer, too, that makes commanders! It is not mere talk, on
either side. It means that by some sixth sense a strong man and his men
have discovered something that is good in each other.

Brown kept rigidly to that point of view in everything he did, from that
time on until he reached Jailpore. He believed himself to be engaged on
a forlorn hope that was so close to being an absolute impossibility as
to be almost the same thing. He had no doubt whatever in his own mind
but that his own death, and the death of those with him, was a matter
now of hours, or possibly of minutes. His one resolute determination
was to die, and make the others die, in a manner befitting their oath
of service. He had orders, and he would pass them on according to his
interpretation of them. He would obey his orders, and they theirs, and
the rest was no business of his or anybodyâ€™s.
They put the fakir in a hut; where Juggut Khan--too weary for
foraging--stood guard over him. When a crowd collected round the hut,
and Juggut Khan applied the butt of a lighted cigarette to the tender
skin between the fakirâ€™s shoulder-blades, the anxious fakir-worshipers
were told that all was well. They were to let the white soldiers take
two wagons, or three even, if they wanted them. They were to return
to their houses at once, and hide, lest the devils who would shortly
overwhelm the white men should make mistakes and include them, too, in
the whelming. He, the fakir, intended to take the white men for a little
journey along the road toward Jailpore, where the devils who would deal
with them would have no opportunity to make mistakes. And, since the
natives knew that Jailpore was a rebel stronghold, and that ten white
men and a native would have no chance to do the slightest damage there,
they chose to believe the fakir and to obey him.
Hindus have as stubborn and unalterable a habit of obeying and believing
their priests--when the fancy suits them--as white men of other
religions have.
If the fakir had told them through the doorway of the hut that he
intended going with the white men in the direction of Bholat, they would
most surely have prevented him. But it suited them very well indeed to
have the white men killed elsewhere. It was not likely, but there might
be a column on its way from Bholat now; and if that column came, and
found the bones of British soldiers as well as a burned-out guard-house,
vengeance would be dire and prompt. Between where they were and
Jailpore, the white men could not possibly escape. And at Jailpore,
if not sooner, they must surely die. So they believed the fakir, and
retired to the seclusion of their houses.
It was wonderful, of course, but no more wonderful than a thousand other
happenings in â€˜57. All laws of probability and general average were
upset that year, when sixty thousand men held down an armed continent.
Even stranger things were happening than that two bullock-carts
should dawdle through a rebel-seething district in the direction of a
plundered, blood-soaked rebel stronghold; stranger even than that on
the foremost bullock-cart a lean and louse-infested fakir should be
squatting, guarded by British soldiers, who marched on either hand; or
that a Rajput, who could trace his birth from a thousand-year-long line
of royal chieftains, should be sleeping in the bullock-cart behind,
followed closely by a black charger with a British saddle on its back,
which ate corn from the tail-board of the wagon; stranger things, even,
than that a British sergeant should be marching last of all, with his
stern eyes roving a little wildly but his jaw set firm and his tread as
rigid and authoritative and abrupt as though he were marching to inspect
accouterments.
In more than a dozen places, about a dozen men were holding a fort
against an army. They were using every wile and trick and dodge that
ingenuity or inspiration could provide them with, and they were mostly
contriving to hold out. But there were none who did anything more daring
or more unusual than to march to the attack of a city, with a hostile
fakir in the van, and nothing else but their eleven selves and their
rifles to assist them. There is a tremendous difference between
defending when you have to, and attacking when you might retire.
XII.
There were many more causes than one that worked together to make
possible the entry of Brown and his little force into Jailpore. They
were brave men; they were more than brave and they held the ace of
NA
 But luck favored them as well, and but for luck they must have perished
half a dozen times.
They marched the whole of the first afternoon, and met no one. They only
overtook little straggling parties of rebels, making one and all for
Jailpore, who bolted at the sight of them, imagining them probably to be
the advance-guard of a larger force. The very idiocy of marching eleven
strong through a country infested by their enemies was in their favor.
Nobody could believe that there were no more than eleven of them. Even
the English could not be such lunatics!
That night, they rested for a while, and then went on again. During the
day following they lay in a hollow between some trees and rested, and
slept by turns. They suffered agonies from the heat, and not a little
from hunger, and once or twice they were hard put to it to stop the
Rajputâ€™s charger from neighing when a native pony passed along the
nearby road. But night came again, and with it the screen of darkness
for their strange, almost defenseless caravan. Once or twice the
fakir tried to shout an alarm to passing villagers, but the quick and
energetic application of a cleaning-rod by Brown stopped him always
in the nick of time, and they came within sight of the battlements of
Jailpore without an accident.
Then, though, their problem became really serious, and it was a series
of circumstances altogether out of their control and not connected
with them that made their entry possible. The mutineers in Jailpore had
learned that Kendrick sahib was coming down on them from the north by
forced marches with thirty-five hundred men or more. They were putting
the place into a state of siege, and getting ready by all means in their
power to oppose him.
Little attention was being paid to small parties of arrivals from no man
knew or cared where. And, in a final effort to find the four who were
the lure that was bringing Kendrick down on them, the city was once
more being turned upside down and inside out, and men were even being
tortured who were thought to know of hiding-places.
With purely Eastern logic, the leaders of the rebels had decided that
the sight of the bodies of the four, writhing in their last agony on the
sun-scorched outer wall, would mightily discourage the British when they
came. So no efforts were being spared and no stones left unturned to
find them. The hooks on the wall were sharp and ready, so that they
might be impaled without loss of time in full view of their would-be
rescuers.
Almost every secret passage of the thousand odd had been explored. In
the hurry to run through them and explore the next one, doors had been
left open here and there that had been kept closed in some instances for
centuries.
One door in particular, placed cornerwise in a buttress of the outer
wall, was spotted by Juggut Khan as he circled round the city on his
charger at dusk on the day following their arrival. He brought his
charger back to where the others lay concealed, and then went on an
exploring-expedition on foot--to discover that the outer city wall
was like a sponge, a nest of honey-combed cells and passages wandering
interminably in the fifty-foot-thick brick and rubble rampart.
And while he searched amid the mazy windings of the wall, Bill Brown sat
in the forked top of a tree and studied out the ground-plan of the city.
He was imprinting landmarks in his memory for future reference, and
trying--with a brain that ached from the apparent hopelessness of the
task--to figure out a plan.
He knew by now that the four he had come to rescue were hidden
underneath the powder-magazine, and he could see the magazine itself.
But he could think of no way of rescuing them, for the city absolutely
boiled with frantic, mixed-up castes and creeds picked at random, and
thrown in at random from the whole of India. A mouse could not have
passed through the streets undetected! And yet, from a soldierâ€™s point
of view, there were certain fascinating details to be noticed about
that powder-magazine. In the first place, it had been constructed for
a granary by an emperor who never heard of Joseph, but who had the same
ideal plan for cornering the peopleâ€™s food-supply. And since labor had
been unlimited, and cheap, he had gone about building the thing on the
most thoroughly unpractical and most pretentious plan that he and his
architects could figure out. It was big enough to hold about ten times
as much grain as the province could grow in any one year of plenty. And,
since that was the least practical and most ungranary-like shape, he had
caused it to be built like an enormous beehive, with a tiny platform at
the top.
Winding round and round the huge stone dome, and on the outside, was a
six-foot-wide trail, which was the elevator. Up this, each with a sack
or a basket on his head, the population was to have been induced to run
in single file, dumping its hard-won corn into the granary through an
opening at the top until the granary was full.
The emperor died--by poison--before he could see his cherished project
put into execution, but he had been a very thorough calculator, and
a builder who believed in permanency. He had foreseen that when the
granary was full, and the screw-jacks were turned beneath the cost of
living, there would probably be efforts made by unwashed, untutored,
unenlightened mobs to rape his storehouse. So he had made the little
platform at the top a veritable fortress of a place, such as a handful
of men could hold against a hundred thousand.
There was no known entrance to the granary above ground, except on the
ground level, where a huge stone gateway frowned above a teak-and-iron
door. Above that door there were galleries, and fortalices and cunningly
invented battlements in miniature, from behind whose shelter a resolute
defending-party could pour out a hundred different kinds of death on a
hungry crowd. The place was naturally fire-proof and naturally cool--as
far as any building can be cool in Central India. It was a first-class,
ideal powder-magazine, if useless as a granary; and the last new
conquerors of India had hastened to adopt it as a means of storing up
the explosive medicine with which they kept their foothold.
Naturally, none but White soldiers, and a very few of the more trusted
natives, had ever been allowed to go inside the powder-magazine.
The secret passages beneath it had never been intended for public
convenience or information. They had been designed as a means of rushing
defenders secretly into the granary, and they connected with a tunnel
underneath the palace that had just been burned. They also connected
with the outer wall in such a way that defenders from the ramparts might
be rushed there too, if wanted in a hurry. But, since there never had
been corn kept in the granary, and nobody had ever had the slightest
need to force an entrance, the knowledge even of the existence of the
passages had become barely a memory, and there was not a man living in
Jailpore who knew exactly where they began or where they ended. There
was a man outside who knew, but none inside.
The point about the powder-magazine which most appealed to Brown--next
after his knowledge of its contents, mineral and human--was the fact
that the little platform at its summit overlooked the city-wall, and
that the side of the granary actually touched the wall on the side of
the city farthest from where he sat and spied it out. Ten men on that
protected platform, he thought, might suffer from the sun, but they
could hold the building and command a good-sized section of the city
ramparts against all comers.
He noticed too, though that seemed immaterial at the time, that one
well-aimed shot from heavy ordnance might crash through the upper dome
and set off the powder underneath. There was no artillery that could
be brought against the place, either with the British force or with the
mutineers, but the thought set him to wondering how much powder there
might be stored on the huge round floor below, and what would happen
should it become ignited. It was a sanguinary, interesting, subtle kind
of thought, that suited the condition of his brain exactly! He climbed
down from the tree, feeling almost good-natured.
At the bottom he met Juggut Khan, waiting for him patiently.

were not so profound, I would laugh at you! As it is, if your honor
should see fit to turn the bullocks loose, and tie the fakir fast
between two men and follow me, it seems to me dark enough by now, and I
know the way. Might I furthermore suggest that the ammunition-box would
NA
NA
â€œUpon my honor, Juggut Khan! Youâ€™re getting childish! Are your nerves
NA
â€œListen. There are two ways, sahib. One way leads from the burned-out
barracks to the cellar where the women lie hidden. That way is closed by
debris. The other way leads from the outer wall by a very winding route
to the cellar where the women are. The fakir knows that way, and I do
not, though I know of it. There is a third way, though, that leads from
the outer wall, where I have been exploring, straight almost, if you
disregard a wind or two, to the inside of the powder-magazine. It
enters the magazine through a doorway secretly contrived in an upright
pillar--or so the fakir swears. Now this is my notion, sahib. If we
go in by the lower way, we must come out that way, and run the risk of
being caught as we emerge. That risk will be greatly enhanced when
we have frightened women with us whose eyes have been blinded by the
darkness. But, if we go in by the upper way, and enter the magazine
itself, I can make the fakir show us how to lift the stone trapdoor I
spoke of--the one that I closed when I hid the women. Then I can ascend
with him, and with say four men, while you ascend to the platform at the
top with the remainder of the men, and guard our rear and our exit.
From the top, you will be able to see us as we emerge, and can cover our

NA
NA
â€œThink, sahib! There, he will be in his own batâ€™s nest, so to speak.
These fakirs are the only men who know the windings of all the secret
passages. They are the rats of religion and intrigue. At any step he
might lead us into an ambush, and we might be overwhelmed before we knew
that we were attacked. If we go the other way, though, I can lead the
way myself, and we need only take the fakir to show us how to open the

as he said it, and thought of a certain lance-shaft which had been
broken in the streets of Jailpore.
â€œLead on! Fall in behind me, men! Walk quietly, now, and remember. Hold
NA
The Beluchi and the fakir and Juggut Khan moved in the van, with two
men to hold the fakir. Next marched, or rather tiptoed, Sergeant Brown,
followed by the other men in single file. In that order they hastened
after Juggut Khan, through the darkness, across a dried-out moat and
round the corner of a huge stone buttress. There they disappeared inside
the wall, and a stone swung round and closed the gap behind the last of
them. There was no alarm given, and not a sign or a sound of any kind
to betoken that any one had seen them. Inside the walls the city roared
like a flood-fed maelstrom, and outside all was darkness and the silence
of the dead.
XIII.
There was some smart work done inside the powder-magazine. To be able to
appreciate it properly one would be obliged to do what they did--wander
through a maze of tunnels in a city-wall, blinded by darkness, oppressed
by the stored-up stuffiness and heat of ages and deafened by the
stillness--then emerge unexpectedly in the lamp-lit magazine, among
mutineers who sprawled, and laughed; and chewed betel-nut at their ease
upon the powder-kegs.
Both sides were taken by surprise, but the mutineers had the nominal
advantage, for their eyes were accustomed to the light. They had the
advantage in numbers, too, by almost two to one. But they dared not
fire, for fear of setting off the magazine, whereas Brown and his little
force dared anything. They fully expected to die, and might as well die
that way as any other. And a quick death for the women down below would
be better than anything the rebels had in store for them. Brown yelled
an order, and the rest was too quick, nearly, for the eye to follow.
Three rebels died with bullets in them, and the rest stampeded for the
teak-and-metal door, to find it locked on them, and Brown and the Rajput
standing in front of it on guard. The mutineers attacked fiercely. They
flung themselves all together on the two. But they had yet to learn that
they were tackling, or endeavoring to tackle, the two finest swordsmen
in that part of India. And when they turned, to find more room to fight
in, or to draw their breath, they had to face nine bayonets that hemmed
them in, and drove them closer and even closer to the swords again.
They shouted, but no sound could pierce the walls or escape through that
tremendous door. Even the sound of firing merely echoed upward until it
reached the dome, and then filtered out and upward through the opening
above. They might as well have shouted to their friends in Bholat!
For ten minutes, perhaps, the battle surged and swayed on the stone
floor first one side rushing, then the other. But man after man of the
mutineers went down--appalled by the amazing swordsmanship, disheartened
by the grim determination of their adversaries, bewildered to feebleness
by the suddenness of the attack.
Soon there were but eight of them facing the blood-wet steel, and then
Brown shouted for a fresh formation, swung his contingent into line and
led them with a rush across the floor that swept the remaining mutineers
off their feet.
Three more went down with steel through them, and then the rest
surrendered, throwing down their arms, and begging mercy. Brown made a
bundle of their arms, stowed it in a corner and made the prisoners stand
together in a bunch, while he searched them thoroughly.

It is heavy, in any case. But, if we make him tell us, we can manage
NA
There followed delay while the fakir was induced to forego the pleasure
of a sulking fit. He seemed like a child, anxious to emphasize their
dependence on his knowledge, and needing to be recompelled to each new
thing they needed of him. He was perfectly content, though, to surrender
when he felt the weight of a cleaning-rod on his anatomy, or something
in the way of fire--a match or cigarette for instance--placed where he
would get the most sensation from it.
Then followed more delay, while they rigged a lever of sorts, and a rope
through an iron ring in the trap, and while Juggut Khan hunted for the
secret catch that the fakir swore was hidden underneath a smaller stone
that hinged in the middle of the floor. He found it at last, moved it
and came across to lend a hand with the lever and the rope.
The fakir sat still and smiled at them. His eyes gleamed more horridly
than ever, and his withered arm seemed more than ever to be calling down
dire vengeance on them.

NA
The prisoners and Brownâ€™s men and Juggut Khan and the Beluchi bent
their backs above the lever, or hauled taut on the rope, and the fakir
wriggled with some secret joke.
NA
NA
NA
The fakir writhed delightedly. He seemed more than ever like a wickedly
malicious child.
NA
They strained their utmost, and the huge stone trap gave way with a
sudden jerk.
NA
They all jumped, but they were strained in the wrong position for a
quick recovery, and the ten-ton rock rolled back on unseen hinges to
crush them all, and rolled back and yet farther back--and then stayed!
Brown had snatched a rifle, and had placed it between the rolling rock
and the wall!
He stood wiping the sweat from his forehead, while the rest recovered
their lost balance and walked out from behind unscathed. The rifle
creaked and bent and split. Then the stone leaned farther back, reached
the wall and stayed there!
NA
NA
NA
NA
But Juggut Khan was bending down, and listening at the hole laid bare by
the huge hinged trap.
NA
The men held their breath, even, but not a sound came up from the
darkness down below.
NA
And, even as he asked it, some one in the darkness snuffled, and he
heard a womanâ€™s voice that moaned.
â€œSnff-snff-snff! I wonder if Iâ€™m dead yet! I wouldnâ€™t be, I know, if
NA
NA
NA
â€œGo down and bring her up, please! Take three or four men with you. It
wonâ€™t do to bring women and a child up here and let â€˜em see this awful
fakir and these corpses. Take your time about bringing â€˜em up, while
I make the prisoners carry their dead up on to the roof. Iâ€™ll take the
NA
Just as a six-foot-wide pathway ran round and round the outside of the
dome, another one, scarcely more than a yard wide, ran round the
inside, and formed a roadway to the top in place of a stair. It took the
prisoners and Brownâ€™s men fifteen minutes of continuous effort to carry
up the dead and the fakir, and lay them on the roof.
NA
NA
strange creature seemed to understand him, for his eyes changed from
their baleful hatred to a look of fear.
The bodies slid and rolled down the rounded roof, and fell with a thud
against the battlements, or else went rolling down the circular causeway
that led to the street below.
Brown seemed to be garnering ideas from watching them. He gazed down
at the noisy tumult of the city, watching for a while the efforts of an
ill-directed crowd to put out a fire that blazed in a distant quarter of
the bazaar.
There seemed to him something strangely preconcerted about much of the
hurrying to and fro below him. It struck him as being far too orderly to
be the mere boiling of a loot-crazed mob.
His prisoners gave the secret to him. They were leaning against the
parapet on the other side--the side closest to the city-wall, and
farthest from the top of the causeway--and they were chattering together
excitedly in undertones. Brown walked round to where they stood, and
stared where they stared. Just as they had done, he recognized what lay
below him.
It was faintly outlined in the blackness, picked out here and there by
lanterns, and still too far away for most civilians to name it until
the sun rose and showed its detail. But Brown, the soldier, knew on the
instant, and so did his men.
Suddenly and unexpectedly and sweetly, like a voice in the night that
spoke of hope and strength and the rebirth of order out of chaos, a
bugle gave tongue from where the lanterns swung in straight-kept lines.
NA
Bill Brownâ€™s voice boomed through the opening in the dome, and spread
down the walls of the powder-magazine as though in the inside of a
speaking-trumpet.
NA
â€œThe army has got here from the north! It has come down here from
Harumpore! Itâ€™s outside the walls now, lying on its arms, and evidently
NA
â€œI, too, have news, Brown sahib! All four are living! All four lie here
on the floor of the magazine, and they recover rapidly. They are all but

NA
That winding pathway up the inside of the dome took longer to negotiate
than an ordinary stairway would have done, but presently the Rajput
leaned against the parapet and panted beside Brown.
â€œDâ€™you see them? There they are! Now, look on this side! Dâ€™you see the
preparations going on? Dâ€™you realize what the next thingâ€™s going to be?
Theyâ€™ll come for powder for the guns, soâ€™s to have it all ready for the
NA
A thundering had started on the great teak door below--a thundering that
echoed through the dome like the reverberations of an earthquake. It
was punctuated by the screams of women. The prisoners changed their
attitude, and eyed Brown and the Rajput with an air of truculence again.
â€œTheyâ€™ll be up this causeway in a minute, sahib! Listen. There! Theyâ€™ve
seen the dead bodies that you tossed over. Better it had been to keep

â€œNever mind! We can hold this causeway until morning! Men! Take
close order. Line up at the causeway-entrance. Kneel. Prepare for

NA
He seemed to be thinking hard on some other subject as he spoke.
â€œSahib, one of the women there--she who is maid to the other two--asked
me where Bill Brown might be! She swore to me that she had recognized
his voice when the trapdoor opened up above her. Are you not Bill
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou donâ€™t surprise me, Juggut Khan! I thought I had recognized her
voice. It seemed strangely familiar. Well--here come the rebels up the

There came the answering click of breech-bolts, and a little rustling as
each man eased his position, and laid his elbow on his knee.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThen close it before you go. Iâ€™ve got a reason! Send one of my men up
here with a lantern--one of those that are burning in the magazine. I
NA
NA
â€œThen take the women, with four of my men to help them walk, and get out
as quickly as you can by the way we all came in. Wait for the rest of
my men when you reach the opening in the outer wall, and when they
reach you allot two men to carry each woman, and run--the whole lot of
you--for the army over yonder. One of the women will object. She will
NA
NA
â€œI have another plan. Here they come! Hurry now, be off with the women!
NA
Pattering footsteps sounded on the causeway, and a little crowd of
nearly doubled figures came up it at a run.
NA
The volley took the rebels absolutely by surprise, and no man could miss
his mark at that short range. Five of the rebels fell back headlong, and
the rest, who followed up the causeway, turned on their heels and ran.
NA
NA
His own sword was flashing, and lunging as he spoke, and he had already
checked a sudden rush by the prisoners.
They had thought the moment favorable for joining in the scrimmage from
the rear.
NA
A man came running up with the lantern Brown had asked for, and Brown
took it and began waving it above his head.
NA
NA
A red light began to dance over in the British camp, moving up and down
and sidewise in sudden little jerks. Brown read the jerks, as he could
never have read writing, and a moment later he answered them.
â€œNow, down below, the lot of you! Give me your rifle, you. Iâ€™ll need
NA
NA
â€œNot yet. Thereâ€™s something else yet, and I can do it best. Besides,
some one has got to guard the causeway still. There might be a rush
again at any minute. Listen now. Obey Juggut Khan implicitly as soon as
you get down. His orders are my orders. Understand? Very well, then. And
you without a weapon, your job is to shut the door that you leave the
magazine by tight from the outside--dâ€™you understand me? Call up when
NA
NA
â€œThatâ€™s my business. One minute, though. Here they come again. Get ready
NA
The mutineers made another and a more determined rush up the causeway,
coming up it more than twenty strong, and at the double. Brown let one
volley loose in the midst of them, then led his men at the charge down
on them and drove them over the edge of the causeway by dint of sheer
impact and cold steel. Not one of them reached the ground alive, and
in the darkness it must have been impossible for the mutineers below to
divine how many were the granaryâ€™s defenders.
â€œThatâ€™ll keep â€˜em quiet for a while, Iâ€™ll wager! Now, quick, you men!
Get down below, and follow Juggut Khan, and donâ€™t forget to shut the
door tight on you. These prisoners here are going to follow you--they
may as well go down with you for that matter. No! that wonâ€™t do. They
could open the door below, couldnâ€™t they? Theyâ€™ll have to stay up here.
Got any rope? Then bind them, somebody. Bind their hands and feet. Now,
NA
Brown spent the next few minutes signaling with the lantern, and reading
answering flashes that zig-zagged in the velvet blackness of the British
lines. Then, as a voice boomed up through the granary, â€œAllâ€™s well, sir!
NA
laughed at him.
â€œYou and I are going to turn in our accounts of how weâ€™ve worked out
NA
orders, and Iâ€™ve obeyed orders! Weâ€™ve both accounted for a death or two,
and weâ€™ve both accepted responsibility. Weâ€™re going to know in less than
five minutes from now which of us two was justified. Thereâ€™s one thing
I know, though, without asking. Thereâ€™s one person, and she a woman,

A lantern waved wildly from the British camp, and Brown seized his own
lantern and signaled an answer.
â€œSee that? Thatâ€™s to say, you glassy-eyed horror you, that our mutual
friend Juggut Khan has been seen emerging like a rat from a hole in the
wall. Iâ€™ll give him and his party one more minute to get clear. Then
NA
He cocked his rifle, and examined the breech-bolt and the foresight
carefully. The fakir shuddered, evidently thinking that the charge was
intended for himself.
â€œNo! It wonâ€™t be that way. I know a better! Iâ€™m taking a leaf from your
NA
Brown leaned down into the opening of the dome, and brought the rifle
to his shoulder. There was a chorus of yells from the prisoners, and a
noise like a wounded horseâ€™s scream from the fakir. The rest were bound,
but the fakir rose and writhed toward him on his heels, with his sound
arm stretched up in an attitude of despair beside the withered one.
A chorus of bugles burst out from the British camp, and a volley ripped
through the blackness.
NA
powder-magazine, and pulled the trigger.
Ten minutes later, an army three thousand and five hundred strong
marched in through the gap made in the outer wall by a granary that had
spread itself through--and not over--what was in its way. There were
seventeen tons of powder that responded to the invitation of Brownâ€™s
bullet.
XIV.
Explosions are among the few things--or the many things, whichever way
you like to look at it!--that science can not undertake to harness or
account for. When a gun blows up, or a powder-magazine, the shock kills
whom it kills, as when a shell bursts in a dense-packed firing-line. You
can not kill any man before his time comes, even if a thousand tons of
solid masonry combine with you to whelm him, and go hurtling through the
air with him to absolutely obvious destruction.
The fakirâ€™s time had come, and the prisonersâ€™ time had come. But
Sergeant William Brownâ€™s had not.
They found him, blackened by powder, and with every stitch of clothing
blown from him, clinging to a bunch of lotus-stems in a temple-pond.
There was a piece of fakir in the water with him, and about a ton of
broken granary, besides the remnants of a rifle and other proof that he
had come belched out of a holocaust. The men who came on him had given
their officer the slip, and were bent on a private looting-expedition of
their own. But by the time that they had dragged him from the water, and
he had looted them of wherewithal to clothe himself, their thoughts of
plunder had departed from them. Brown had a way of quite monopolizing
peopleâ€™s thoughts!
There were twenty of them, and he led them all that night, and all
through the morning and the afternoon that followed. He held them
together and worked them and wheeled them and coached and cheered and
compelled them through the hell-tumult of the ghastliest thing there is
beneath the dome of heaven--house-to-house fighting in an Eastern city.
NA
 and many of the men were marched away by companies to put out the
conflagrations that were blazing here and there, he led them outside
the city-wall, stood them at ease in their own line and saluted their
commanding-officer.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWere you the man who signaled to us from the magazine and blew it up

â€œDâ€™you realize that you made the taking of Jailpore possible? That

â€œI had the chance, sir, and I only did what any other man would haâ€™ done
NA
â€œGo and tell that to the Horse Marines--or, rather, tell it to Colonel
Kendrick! Go and report to him at once. Possibly heâ€™ll see it through
NA
So Brown marched off to report himself, and he found Colonel Kendrick
nursing a badly wounded arm before a torn and mud-stained tent.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou lie! He was blown up on the roof of the powder-magazine! I suppose
NA
â€œIâ€™m Brown, sir! I had written orders from General Baines to enter

NA
NA
â€œFor a madman, youâ€™re a circumstantial liar! What happened to the
NA
The colonel sat back, and smothered an exclamation of agony as the
nerves in his injured arm tortured him afresh. He had asked a question
which should settle once and for all this manâ€™s pretentions, and he
waited for the answer with an air of certainty. It was on his lips to
call the guard to take the lunatic away.
â€œJuggut Khan, the Rajput, took them, with nine of my men, and brought
them in to your camp last night, sir. I naturally havenâ€™t seen them
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The colonel called an orderly, and sent the orderly running for Jane
Emmett. A minute later two strong arms were thrown round Bill Brown from
behind, and he was all but carried off his feet.
â€œOh, Bill--Bill--Bill! I knew youâ€™d be all right! Turn round, Bill! Look
NA
She was clinging to him in such a manner that he could not turn, but he
managed to pry her hands loose, and to draw her round in front of him.
â€œI knew, Bill! I felt sure youâ€™d come! And I recognized your voice the
minute that the trapdoor opened and I heard it! I did, Bill! I knew you
in a minute! I didnâ€™t worry then! I knew you wouldnâ€™t come and talk to
me as long as there was any duty to be done. I just waited! They said
you were killed in the explosion, but I knew you werenâ€™t! I knew it! I

NA
NA
NA
â€œIs he the man who entered Jailpore with nine men and a Rajput, and came
NA
NA
NA
â€œUnder favor, sir, my men must be somewhere, if theyâ€™re not all killed.
Theyâ€™ll recognize me. And thereâ€™s the other lot I led all last night and
NA
â€œNever mind! Iâ€™ve decided I believe you! Dâ€™you realize that youâ€™re
NA
NA
â€œWell, I shall take great pleasure in mentioning your name in
despatches. It will go direct, at first hand, to Her Majesty the Queen!
There are few men, let me tell you, Sergeant Brown, who would dare what
you dared in the first place. But, more than that, there are even fewer
men who would leave a sweetheart in some one elseâ€™s care while they blew
up a powder-magazine with themselves on top of it, in order to make
a breach for the army to come in by! My right handâ€™s out of action
NA
The colonel rose, held his uninjured hand out and Brown shook it, since
he was ordered to.
â€œI consider it an honor and a privilege to have shaken hands with you,
NA
NA
NA
He joined his regiment, when he had helped to sort out the bleeding
remnants of it from among the by-ways and back alleys of Jailpore. And
the chaplain married him and Jane Emmett out of hand. He sent her off
at once with her former mistress to the coast, and marched off with his
regiment to Delphi. And at Delphi his name was once more mentioned in
despatches.
When the Mutiny was over, and the country had settled down again to
peace and reincarnation of a nation had begun, Brown found himself
hoisted to a civil appointment that was greater and more highly paid
than anything his modest soul had ever dreamed of.
He never understood the reason for it, although he did his fighting-best
consistently to fill the job; and he never understood why Queen Victoria
should have taken the trouble to write a letter to him in which she
thanked him personally, nor why they should have singled out for praise
and special notice a fellow who had merely done his duty.
Perhaps that was the reason why he was such a conspicuous success in
civil life. They still talk of how Bill Brown, with Jane his wife and
Juggut Khan the Rajput to advise him, was Resident Political Adviser to
a Maharajah, and of how the Maharajah loathed him, and looked sidewise
at him--but obeyed. That, though, is not a war-story. It is a story of
the saving of a war, and shall go on record, some day, beneath a title
of its own.
FOR THE SALT HE HAD EATEN
Prologue
To the northward of Hanadra, blue in the sweltering heat-haze, lay
Siroeh, walled in with sun-baked mud and listless. Through a wooden gate
at one end of the village filed a string of women with their water-pots.
Oxen, tethered underneath the thatched eaves or by the thirsty-looking
trees, lay chewing the cud, almost too lazy to flick the flies away.
Even the village goats seemed overcome with lassitude. Here and there
a pariah dog sneaked in and out among the shadows or lay and licked
his sores beside an offal-heap; but there seemed to be no energy in
anything. The bone-dry, hot-weather wind had shriveled up verdure and
ambition together.
But in the mud-walled cottages, where men were wont to doze through the
long, hot days, there were murmurings and restless movement. Men lay
on thong-strung beds, and talked instead of dreaming, and the women
listened and said nothing--which is the reverse of custom. Hanadra was
what it always had been, thatched, sun-baked lassitude; but underneath
the thatch there thrummed a beehive atmosphere of tension.
In the center of the village, where the one main road that led from the
main gate came to an abrupt end at a low mud wall, stood a house that
was larger than the others and somewhat more neatly kept; there had been
an effort made at sweeping the enclosure that surrounded it on all four
sides, and there was even whitewash, peeling off in places but still
comparatively white, smeared on the sun-cracked walls.
Here, besides murmurings and movement, there was evidence of real
activity. Tethered against the wall on one side of the house stood a row
of horses, saddled and bridled and bearing evidence of having traveled
through the heat; through the open doorway the sunshine glinted on a
sword-hilt and amid the sound of many voices rang the jingling of a
spur as some one sat cornerwise on a wooden table and struck his toe
restlessly against the leg.
Another string of women started for the water-hole, with their
picturesque brass jars perched at varying angles on their heads; and as
each one passed the doorway of this larger house she turned and scowled.
A Rajput, lean and black-bearded and swaggering, came to the door and
watched them, standing proudly with his arms folded across his breast.
As the last woman showed her teeth at him, he laughed aloud.

chupatties sent from house to house at sunset--and that time blood ran

Rajput Horse, and Bellairs sahib was colonel, things were different! But
we conquered, and after conquest came security. The English have grown
overconfident; they think that Mussulman will always war with Hindu, the
one betraying the other; they will not understand that this lies deeper
than jealousy--they will not listen! Six months ago I rode to Jundhra
and whispered to the general sahib what I thought; but he laughed back
at me. He said â€˜Wolf! wolf!â€™ to me and drew me inside his bungalow and

There was a chorus of assent, and the Risaldar arose to let his sons and
grandsons file past him. He, who had beggared himself to give each one
of them a start in life, felt a little chagrined that they should now
refuse to exchange horses with him; but his eye glistened none the
less at the sight of their stalwart frames and at the thought of what a
fighting unit he could bring to serve the Raj.

The midnight jackals howled their discontent while heat-cracked
India writhed in stuffy torment that was only one degree less than
unendurable. Through the stillness and the blackness of the night came
every now and then the high-pitched undulating wails of women, that no
one answered-for, under that Tophet-lid of blackness, punctured by the
low-hung, steel-white stars, men neither knew nor cared whose child had
died. Life and hell-hot torture and indifference--all three were one.
There was no moon, nothing to make the inferno visible, except that here
and there an oil lamp on some housetop glowed like a blood-spot against
the blackness. It was a sensation, rather than sight or sound, that
betrayed the neighborhood of thousands upon thousands of human beings,
sprawling, writhing, twisting upon the roofs, in restless suffering.
There was no pity in the dry, black vault of heaven, nor in the bone-dry
earth, nor in the hearts of men, during that hot weather of â€˜57. Men
waited for the threatened wrath to come and writhed and held their
tongues. And while they waited in sullen Asiatic patience, through
the restless silence and the smell--the suffocating, spice-fed,
filth-begotten smell of India--there ran an undercurrent of even deeper
mystery than India had ever known.
Priest-ridden Hanadra, that had seen the downfall of a hundred kings,
watched through heat-wearied eyes for another whelming the blood-soaked,
sudden flood that was to burst the dam of servitude and rid India of her
latest horde of conquerors. But eight hundred yards from where her high
brick walls lifted their age-scars in the stifling reek, gun-chains
jingled in a courtyard, and, sharp-clicking on age-old flagstones, rose
the ring of horsesâ€™ feet.
Section Number One of a troop of Bengal Horse Artillery was waiting
under arms. Sabered and grim and ready stood fifty of the finest men
that England could produce, each man at his horseâ€™s head; and blacker
even than the night loomed the long twelve-pounders, in tow behind their
limbers. Sometimes a trace-chain jingled as a wheel-horse twitched his
flank; and sometimes a man spoke in a low voice, or a horse stamped
on the pavement; but they seemed like black graven images of war-gods,
half-smothered in the reeking darkness. And above them, from a window
that overlooked the courtyard, shone a solitary lamp that glistened here
and there upon the sleek black guns and flickered on the saber-hilts,
and deepened the already dead-black atmosphere of mystery.
From the room above, where the lamp shone behind gauze curtains came the
sound of voices; and in the deepest, death-darkest shadow of the door
below there stood a man on guard whose fingers clutched his sword-hilt
and whose breath came heavily. He stood motionless, save for his
heaving breast; between his fierce, black mustache and his up-brushed,
two-pointed beard, his white teeth showed through parted lips. But he
gave no other sign that he was not some Rajput princelingâ€™s image carved
out of the night.
He was an old man, though, for all his straight back and military
carriage. The night concealed his shabbiness; but it failed to hide the
medals on his breast, one bronze, one silver, that told of campaigns
already a generation gone. And his patience was another sign of age; a
younger man of his blood and training would have been pacing to and fro
instead of standing still.
He stood still even when footsteps resounded on the winding stair above
and a saber-ferrule clanked from step to step. The gunners heard and
stood squarely to their horses. There was a rustling and a sound of
NA
Rajput stayed motionless until the footsteps reached the door. Then he
took one step forward, faced about and saluted.

Bellairs stepped back with a start into the doorway again--one hand on
his sword-hilt. The Indian moved sidewise to where the lamplight from
the room above could fall upon his face.
NA
Then the lieutenant recognized him.

Mahommed Khan pointed to the waiting guns and smiled.

â€œThey seem to have forgotten that Iâ€™m married, and by the same token,

no knowing what this order means; there might be trouble to face of some
kind. Iâ€™ve sent into Hanadra to try to drum up an escort for her and Iâ€™m

The Risaldar stroked at his beard reflectively.

The Risaldar saluted him again.

â€œThat, sahib, I know not--not having written out thy orders! I heard

NA
â€œNay, listen, sahib! Of a truth, thou art a hot-head as thy father was

for its return, and wait for the parking of the guns before they put

NA
â€œSahib, listen! When the news came to me I was at Siroeh, dangling a
great-grandson on my knee. There were no orders, but it seemed the Raj

The grim old warriorâ€™s voice thrilled with the throb of loyalty, as he
stood erect and pointed to the shadowy archway through which the road
wound to the plain beyond.
â€œSahib, I taught thy father how to use his sword! I nursed thee
when thou wert little. Would I give three false counsel now? Ride,

Bellairs turned away and looked at his charger, a big, brown Khaubuli
stallion, named for the devil and true in temper and courage to his
name; two men were holding him, ten paces off.
â€œSuch a horse I need this night, Sahib! Thy second charger can keep pace

Bellairs gave a sudden order, and the men led the brute back into his
stable.

Then he turned to the Risaldar again, with hand outstretched.

and make such disposition for my wifeâ€™s safety as you see fit. Follow as
and when you can; I trust you, and I shall be grateful to you whatever

â€œWell spoken, Sahib! I knew thou wert a man! We who serve the Raj have
neither sons, nor wives, nor sweethearts! Allah guard you, Sahib! The

NA
The lieutenant turned and mounted.
NA
NA
â€œMount! Good-by, Mahommed Khan! Good luck to you! Section, right! Trot,
NA
With a crash and the clattering of iron shoes on stone the guns jingled
off into the darkness, were swallowed by the gaping archway and rattled
out on the plain.
The Risaldar stood grimly where he was until the last hoof-beat and bump
of gun-wheel had died away into the distance; then he turned and climbed
the winding stairway to the room where the lamp still shone through
gauzy curtains.
On a dozen roof-tops, where men lay still and muttered, brown eyes
followed the movements of the section and teeth that were betel-stained
grinned hideously.
From a nearby temple, tight-packed between a hundred crowded houses,
came a wailing, high-pitched solo sung to Siva--the Destroyer. And as it
died down to a quavering finish it was followed by a ghoulish laugh that
echoed and reechoed off the age-old city-wall.
Proud as a Royal Rajput--and there is nothing else on Godâ€™s green earth
that is even half as proud--true to his salt, and stout of heart even
if he was trembling at the knees, Mahommed Khan, two-medal man and
Risaldar, knocked twice on the door of Mrs. Lellairsâ€™ room, and entered.
And away in the distance rose the red reflection of a fire ten leagues
away. The Mutiny of â€˜57 had blazed out of sullen mystery already, the
sepoys were burning their barracks half-way on the road to Jundhra!
And down below, to the shadow where the Risaldar had stood, crept
a giant of a man who had no military bearing. He listened once, and
sneaked into the deepest black within the doorway and crouched and
waited.
II.
Hanadra reeks of history, blood-soaked and mysterious. Temples piled on
the site of olden temples; palaces where half-forgotten kings usurped
the thrones of conquerors who came from God knows where to conquer older
kings; roads built on the bones of conquered armies; houses and palaces
and subterranean passages that no man living knows the end of and few
even the beginning. Dark corridors and colonnades and hollow walls;
roofs that have ears and peep-holes; floors that are undermined by
secret stairs; trees that have swayed with the weight of rotting human
skulls and have shimmered with the silken bannerets of emperors. Such is
Hanadra, half-ruined, and surrounded by a wall that was age-old in the
dawn of written history.
Even its environs are mysterious; outside the walls, there are carven,
gloomy palaces that once re-echoed to the tinkle of stringed instruments
and the love-songs of some sultanâ€™s favorite--now fallen into ruins,
or rebuilt to stable horses or shelter guns and stores and men; but
eloquent in all their new-smeared whitewash, or in crumbling decay, of
long-since dead intrigue. No places, those, for strong men to live alone
in, where night-breezes whisper through forgotten passages and dry teak
planking recreaks to the memory of dead menâ€™s footsteps.
But strong men are not the only makings of an Empire, nor yet the only
sufferers. Wherever the flag of England flies above a distant outpost
or droops in the stagnant moisture of an Eastern swamp, there are the
graves of Englandâ€™s women. The bones that quarreling jackals crunch
among the tombstones--the peace along the clean-kept borderline--the
pride of race and conquest and the cleaner pride of work well done,
these are not manâ€™s only. Man does the work, but he is held to it and
cheered on by the girl who loves him.
And so, above a stone-flagged courtyard, in a room that once had echoed
to the laughter of a sultanâ€™s favorite, it happened that an English
girl of twenty-one was pacing back and forth. Through the open curtained
window she had seen her husband lead his command out through the echoing
archway to the plain beyond; she had heard his boyish voice bark out the
command and had listened to the rumble of the gun-wheels dying in the
distance--for the last time possibly. She knew, as many an English girl
has known, that she was alone, one white woman amid a swarm of sullen
Aryans, and that she must follow along the road the guns had taken,
served and protected by nothing more than low-caste natives.
And yet she was dry-eyed, and her chin was high; for they are a strange
breed, these Anglo-Saxon women who follow the men they love to the
lonely danger-zone. Ruth Bellairs could have felt no joy in her
position; she had heard her husband growling his complaint at being
forced to leave her, and she guessed what her danger was. Fear must have
shrunk her heartbeats and loneliness have tried her courage. But there
was an ayah in the room with her, a low-caste woman of the conquered
race; and pride of country came to her assistance. She was firm-lipped
and, to outward seeming, brave as she was beautiful.
Even when the door resounded twice to the sharp blow of a saber-hilt,
and the ayahâ€™s pock-marked ebony took on a shade of gray, she stood like
a queen with an army at her back and neither blanched nor trembled.
NA
The ayah shrank into herself and showed the whites of her eyes and
grinned, as a pariah dog might show its teeth--afraid, but scenting
carrion.
NA
The ayah shuddered and collapsed, babbling incoherencies and calling on
a horde of long-neglected gods to witness she was innocent. She clutched
strangely at her breast and used only one hand to drag her shawl around
her face. While she babbled she glanced wild-eyed around the long,
low-ceilinged room. Ruth Bellairs looked down at her pityingly and went
to the door herself and opened it.
NA
Ruth Bellairs started and the ayah screamed.
NA
A black beard and a turban and the figure of a man--and then white teeth
and a saber-hilt and eyes that gleamed moved forward from the darkness.
NA
stepped out into the lamplight and closed the door behind him. Then,
with a courtly, long-discarded sweep of his right arm, he saluted.
NA
NA
The old manâ€™s shabbiness was very obvious as he faced her, with his back
against the iron-studded door; but he stood erect as a man of thirty,
and his medals and his sword-hilt and his silver scabbard-tip were
bright.
NA
He bowed.
NA
The old man bowed again.
â€œHe left you in my keeping, heavenborn. I am to bring you safe to

She held her hand out and he took it like a cavalier, bending until he
could touch her fingers with his lips.

â€œWho knows, memsahib! The orders of the Sirkar come, and we of the

her shoulders. â€œThat I call service, Risaldar. She cowers when a knock

The Risaldar bowed low again.

Ruth walked down the room toward the window, drew the curtain back and
leaned her head out where whatever breeze there was might fan her cheek.
The Risaldar strode over to where the ayah cowered by an inner doorway.
NA
scavenger of sweepings! What part hast thou in all this treachery?

The ayah shrank away from him and tried to scream, but he gripped her by
the throat and shook her.

But his ten iron fingers held her in a vise-like grip and she could not
have answered him if she had tried to.
NA
window. He released the ayah and let her tumble as she pleased into a
heap.
NA
NA
NA
â€œA burning? What burning? Funeral pyres? Itâ€™s very big for funeral
NA
NA
NA
She was still unfrightened, unsuspicious of the untoward. The Risaldarâ€™s
arrival on the scene had quite restored her confidence and she felt
content to ride with him to Jundhra on the morrow.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
He stood between her and the ayah, so that she could not see the woman
huddled on the floor.
â€œThe worst? You mean then--my--my--husband--you donâ€™t mean that my
NA
â€œI mean, heavenborn that there is insurrection! All India is ablaze from
end to end. These dogs here in Hanadra wait to rise because they think
the section will return here in an hour or two; then they propose to
burn it, men, guns and horses, like snakes in the summer grass. It is
well that the section will not return! We will ride out safely before
NA
NA
â€œNay! That he did not! Had I told him, he had disobeyed his orders and
shamed his service; he is young yet, and a hothead! He will be far
along the road to Jundhra before he knows what burns. And then he will

NA
NA
She stood in silence for a moment, gazing at the red glow on the
skyline, and then turned to read, if she could, what was on the grim,
grizzled face of Mahommed Khan.
NA
NA
She was leaning through the window again and did not answer him.
NA
He leaned out beside her and gazed into the shadow. Then he called
softly in a tongue she did not know and some one rose up from the shadow
and answered him.
NA
â€œNay. Guarded, heavenborn! That man is my half-brother. May I take the
NA
NA
The mystery and sense of danger were getting the better of her; she was
thoroughly afraid now--afraid to be left alone in the room for a minute
even.
NA
NA
He bowed. Swinging the door open, he pushed the ayah through it to the
room beyond. Ruth was left alone, to watch the red glow on the skyline
and try to see the outline of the watcher in the gloom below. No sound
came through the heavy teak door that the Risaldar had slammed behind
him, and no sound came from him who watched; but from the silence of the
night outside and from dark corners of the room that she was in and from
the roof and walls and floor here came little eerie noises that made her
flesh creep, as though she were being stared at by eyes she could not
see. She felt that she must scream, or die, unless she moved; and she
was too afraid to move, and by far too proud to scream! At last she
tore herself away from the window and ran to a low divan and lay on it,
smothering her face among the cushions. It seemed an hour before the
Risaldar came out again, and then he took her by surprise.

NA
His left hand was on his saber-hilt, thrusting it toward her
respectfully; she noticed that it trembled.

her, and she saw that there were beads of perspiration on his wrist.
NA
NA
â€œShe confessed before she--she confessed! Have I the heavenbornâ€™s
NA
NA
NA
NA
He strode to the inner door and locked it and hid the key in an inside
pocket of his tunic.
NA
NA
He scarcely waited for an answer, but walked to the window, leaned
out of it and whistled. A minute later he was answered by the sound of
fingernails scrabbling on the outer door. He turned the key and opened
it.
NA
Barefooted and ragged, but as clean as a soldier on parade and with huge
knots of muscles bulging underneath his copper skin, a Rajput entered,
bowing his six feet of splendid manhood almost to the floor.
â€œThis, heavenborn, is my half-brother, son of a low-born border-woman,

NA
NA
NA

NA
NA
â€œThere is a hidden passage leading from the archway; he peeps out
NA
held his horny fingers about an inch apart to show the distance.
NA
The Rajput nodded.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Without a word in answer the giant turned and went, and the Risaldar
made fast the door behind him. Ruth sat with her face between her hands,
trying not to cry or shudder, but obsessed and overpowered by a sense
of terror. The mystery that surrounded her was bad enough; but this
mysterious ordering and coming to and fro among her friends was worse
than horrible. She knew, though, that it would be useless to question
Mahommed Khan before he chose to speak. They waited there in the dimly
lighted room for what seemed tike an age again; she, pale and tortured
by weird imaginings; he, grim and bolt-upright like a statue of a
warrior. Then sounds came from the stairs again and the Risaldar hurried
to the door and opened it.
In burst the Risaldarâ€™s half-brother, breathing heavily and bearing a
load nearly as big as he was.

gagged and pinioned burden on the floor. â€œSee where he all but broke

NA

and the Risaldar walked to the lamp and brought it, to hold it above the
prostrate form. Ruth left the divan and stood between the men, terrified
by she knew not what fear, but drawn into the lamplight by insuperable
curiosity.

The half-brother did as he was told.
â€œLay it here, legs upward, on the floor.
â€œNow, bind him to it--an arm to a leg and a leg to a leg.
â€œRemove his shoes.

He seized a brass tongs, chose a glowing coal and held it six inches
from the High Priestâ€™s naked foot.
Ruth screamed.
â€œCourage, heavenborn! Have courage! This is naught to what he would have
done to thee!... Now, speak, thou priest of infidels! What plans are

III.
NA
NA
The close-cropped, pipe-clayed non-commissioned officer spurred his
horse into a canter until his scabbard clattered at young Bellairsâ€™
boot. Nothing but the rattling and the jolting of the guns and
ammunition-wagon was audible, except just on ahead of them the
click-clack, click-click-clack of the advance-guard. To the right and
left of them the shadowy forms of giant banian-trees loomed and slid
past them as they had done for the past four hours, and for ten paces
ahead they could see the faintly outlined shape of the trunk road that
they followed. The rest was silence and a pall of blackness obscuring
everything. They had ridden along a valley, but they had emerged on
rising ground and there was one spot of color in the pall now, or else a
hole in it.
NA
NA
NA
â€œVery hard to tell on a night like this, sir. It might be ten miles
away and might be twenty. By my reckoning itâ€™s on our road, though, and
NA
â€œSo it seems to me; our road swings round to the right presently,
doesnâ€™t it? Thatâ€™ll lead us right to it. That would make it Doonha more
NA
â€œI was thinking it might be, sir. If itâ€™s Doonha, it means that the
sepoy barracks and all the stores are burning--thereâ€™s nothing else

NA
â€œYes, sir, but theyâ€™re under canvas; tents would blaze up, but theyâ€™d

Bellairs rode up to the advance-guard.
NA
barracks burning over yonder. Thereâ€™s no knowing, though, what it is.
Send four men on, two hundred yards ahead of you, and you and the rest
keep a good two hundred yards ahead of the guns. See that the men keep
on the alert, and mind that they spare their horses as much as possible.
NA
NA
NA
At a word from the sergeant, four men clattered off and were swallowed
in the darkness. A minute later the advance-guard followed them and
then, after another minuteâ€™s pause, young Bellairsâ€™ voice was raised
into a ringing shout again.
NA
The trace-chains tightened, and the clattering, bumping, jingling
procession began again, its rear brought up by the six-horse
ammunition-wagon. They rode speechless for the best part of an hour,
each manâ€™s eyes on the distant conflagration that had begun now to light
up the whole of the sky ahead of them. They still rode in darkness, but
they seemed to be approaching the red rim of the Pit. Huge, billowing
clouds of smoke, red-lit on the under side, belched upward to the
blackness overhead, and a something that was scarcely sound--for it was
yet too distant--warned them that it was no illusion they were riding
into. The conflagration grew. It seemed to be nearly white-hot down
below.
Bellairs wet his finger and held it extended upward.
NA
a grass-fire, thereâ€™d be game and rats and birds and things--some of â€˜em
would bolt this way. Thatâ€™s the Doonha barracks burning or Iâ€™m a black
NA
A minute later, every man in the section pricked up his ears. There
was no order given; but a sensation ran the whole length of it and a
movement from easy riding to tense rigidity that could be felt by some
sixth sense. Every man was listening, feeling, groping with his senses
for something he could neither hear as yet nor see, but that he knew was
there. And then, far-distant yet--not above, but under the jolting of
the gun-wheels and the rattle of the scabbards--they could hear the
clickety-clickety-clickety-click of a horse hard-ridden.
They had scarcely caught that sound, they had barely tightened up their
bridle-reins, when another sound, one just as unmistakable, burst out in
front of them. A ragged, ill-timed volley ripped out from somewhere
near the conflagration and was answered instantly by one that was
close-ripped like the fire of heavy ordnance. And then one of the
advance-guard wheeled his horse and drove his spurs home rowel-deep. He
came thundering back along the road with his scabbard out in the wind
behind him and reined up suddenly when his horseâ€™s forefeet were abreast
of the lieutenant.
â€œThereâ€™s some one coming, sir, hard as he can gallop! Heâ€™s one of our
men by the sound of him. His horse is shod--and I thought I saw steel
NA
NA
NA
NA
Bellairs felt his sword-hilt and cocked a pistol stealthily, but he gave
no orders to the section. This might be a native soldier run amuck, and
it might be a messenger; but in either case, friend or foe, if there was
only one man he could deal with him alone.
NA
never checked for a single instant.
NA
NA
NA
One of the advance-guard reined his horse across the road. The others

unison.
The main body of the advance came up with them.

NA
NA
the darkness like an apparition and bore straight down on them--his head
bored a little to one side, the red rims of his nostrils wide distended
and his whole sense and energy, and strength concentrated on pleasing
the speed-hungry Irishman who rode him. He flashed into them head-on,
like a devil from the outer darkness. His head touched a manâ€™s knee--and
he rose and tried to jump him! His breast crashed full into the
obstruction and horse and gunner crashed down to the road.
A dozen arms reached out--twelve horses surged in a clattering
melee--two hands gripped the reins and four arms seized the rider,
and in a second the panting charger was brought up all-standing. The
sergeant thrust his grim face closer and peered at their capture.
NA
NA
And at that instant the section rattled, up behind them, with Bellairs
in the lead.
NA
â€œBloody murder, arson, high treason, mutiny and death! Blood and onions,
man! Donâ€™t your men know an officer when they see one? Who are you? Are
you Bellairs? Then why in Godâ€™s name didnâ€™t you say so sooner? What have
you waited for?
â€œHow many hours is it since you got the message through from Jundhra?
Couldnâ€™t you see the barracks burning? Who am I--Iâ€™m Captain Oâ€™Rourke,
of the Thirty-third, sent to see what youâ€™re doing on the road, thatâ€™s
who I am! A full-fledged; able-bodied captain wasted in a crisis, just
because you didnâ€™t choose to hurry! Poison take your confounded gunners,
sir! Have they nothing better to engage them than holding up officers on

NA
prompt as are most of his breed to appear casual the moment there was
cause to feel excited.

â€œYou shouldnâ€™t take chances with a section of artillery! Theyâ€™re not
like infantry--they donâ€™t sleep all the time--you canâ€™t ride through
NA
â€œDonâ€™t sleep, donâ€™t they! Then what have you been doing on the road? And
NA
NA
legged his panting charger over to the roadside.
NA
NA

â€œâ€˜Of course not! Why?â€™ says the man! Hell and hot porridge! Why, the
whole of Indiaâ€™s ablaze from end to end--the sepoys have mutinied to a
man, and the rest have joined them! Thereâ€™s bloody murder doing--theyâ€™ve
shot their officers--Hammondâ€™s dead and Carstairs and Welfleet and
heaven knows who else. Theyâ€™ve burned their barracks and the stores and
theyâ€™re trying to seize the magazine. If they get that, God help every
one. Theyâ€™re short of ammunition as it is, but two companies of the
Thirty-third canâ€™t hold out for long against that horde. Youâ€™ll be in
the nick of time! Hurry, man! For the love of anything you like to name,

â€œTrot, march!

Bellairs was thinking of his wife, alone in Hanadra, unprotected except
by a sixty-year-old Risaldar and a half-brother who was a civilian and
an unknown quantity. There were cold chills running down his spine and
a sickening sensation in his stomach. He rode ahead of the guns, with
Oâ€™Rourke keeping pace beside him. He felt that he hated Oâ€™Rourke, hated
everything, hated the Service, and the country--and the guns, that could
put him into such a fiendish predicament.
Oâ€™Rourke broke silence first.

â€œHeaven knows! I left her under the protection of Risaldar Mahommed

â€œThen thank God! Iâ€™d sooner trust him than I would a regiment. Heâ€™ll

â€œDunno! I didnâ€™t write â€˜em. I can guess, though. Thereâ€™d be something
like nine reasons. For one thing, theyâ€™d credit you with sense enough to
bring her in without being told. For another, the messenger who took the
note might have got captured on the way--they wouldnâ€™t want to tell
the sepoys more than they could help. Then thereâ€™d be something like a
hurry. Theyâ€™re attacked there too--canâ€™t even send us assistance. Told
us to waylay you and make use of you. Maybe they forgot your wife--maybe

It was difficult to talk at the speed that they were making, with their
own horses breathing heavily, Oâ€™Rourkeâ€™s especially; the guns thundering
along behind them and the advance-guard clattering in front, and their
attention distracted every other minute by the noise of volleys on ahead
and the occasional staccato rattle of independent firing. The whole
sky was now alight with the reflection of the burning barracks and they
could see the ragged outlines of the cracking walls silhouetted against
the blazing red within. One mile or less from the burning buildings they
could see, too, the occasional flash of rifles where the two companies
of the Thirty-third, Honorable East India Companyâ€™s Light Infantry, held
out against the mutineers.

quickly, now youâ€™ve come. Then--Steady, boy! Steady! Hold up! This poor

They could hear the roar of the flames now, and could see the figures
of sepoys running here and there. The rattle of musketry was incessant.
They could hear howls and yells and bugle-calls blown at random by the
sepoys, and once, in answer as it seemed to a more than usually savage
chorus from the enemy--a chorus that was punctuated by a raging din of
intermittent rifle-fire--a ringing cheer.

The men rose in their stirrups all together, and sent roaring through

The two beleaguered companies heard it and answered promptly with
another cheer.
NA
British soldiers do not cheer like that, all together, unless there is
very good reason to feel cheerless. They fight, each man according to
his temperament, swearing or laughing, sobbing or singing comic songs,
until the case looks grim. Then, though, the same thrill runs through
the whole of them, the same fire blazes in their eyes, and the last
ditch that they line has been known to be a grave for the enemy.
NA
The trumpet rang. The advance-guard drew rein for the section to catch
up. The guns drew abreast of one another and the mounted gunners formed
in a line, two deep, in front of them. The ammunition-wagon trailed like
a tail behind.

Crash went the guns and the following wagon across the roadside ditch.
The tired horses came up to the collar as service-horses always will,
generous to the last ounce of strength they have in them.
NA
The limbers bumped and jolted and the short-handled whips cracked like
the sound of pistol-practise. Blind, unreconnoitered, grim--like a black
thunderbolt loosed into the blackness--the two guns shot along a
hollow, thundered up a ridge and burst into the fire-light up above the
mutineers, in the last place where any one expected them. A howl came
from the road that they had left, a hundred sepoys had rushed down to
block their passage the moment that their cheer had rung above the noise
of battle.

The orders were given and obeyed almost before the guns had lost their
motion. The charges had been rammed into the greedy muzzles before the
horses were away, almost--and that takes but a second--the horses vanish
like blown smoke when the game begins. A howl from the mutineers told
that they were seen; a volley from the British infantry announced that

The grapeshot whined and shrieked, and the ranks of the sepoys wilted,
mown down as though a scythe had swept them. Once, and once only, they
gathered for a charge on the two guns; but they were met half-way up the
rise by a shrieking blast of grape that ripped through them and took the
heart out of them; and the grape was followed by well-aimed volleys from
behind. Then they drew off to sulk and make fresh plans at a distance,
and Bellairs took his section unmolested into the Thirty-third-lined
rampart round the magazine.

Trevor seemed surprised, but he saluted and said nothing.

Bellairs sought out his best man and the freshest-seeming horse in
wondering silence. He felt sick with anxiety, for what could one lone
veteran Risaldar do to protect Mrs. Bellairs against such a horde as
was in Hanadra? He looked at the barracks, which were still blazing
heavenward and illuminating the whole country-side, and shuddered as he
wondered whether his quarters at Hanadra were in flames yet.

But Bellairs did not hear the rest.
A bugle rang out into the night. The gunners stood by their horses. Even
the sentries, posted outside the rampart to guard against alarm, stood
to attention, and Colonel Carter, wincing from the pain in his right
arm, walked out in front of where the men were lined up.
Captain Oâ€™Rourke walked up and saluted him.
â€œIâ€™ve arranged to bury them in that trench we dug this evening, sir,
when the trouble started. Itâ€™s not very deep, but it holds them all.
NA
NA
â€œIâ€™ve burnt their fingers with matches, sir. I donâ€™t know of any better

NA
â€œUm! Thatâ€™s a pity. And Iâ€™m afraid I canâ€™t spare the time. Take a

A party marched away toward the trench, and several minutes later
Oâ€™Rourkeâ€™s voice was heard calling through the darkness, â€œAll ready,

with their hilts raised to their hips and the two long lines of infantry
stood rigid at the general salute, while five volleys--bulleted--barked

Ten minutes later two companies of men marched out behind the guns,
followed by a cart that bore their wounded. As they reached the trunk
road they were saluted by a reverberating blast when the magazine that
they had fought to hold blew skyward. They turned to cheer the explosion
and then settled down to march in deadly earnest and, if need be, to
fight a rear-guard action all the way.
And in the opposite direction one solitary gunner rode,

short and to the point. It ran:

The red glow of barracks burning--an ayah from whom a dagger has
been taken locked in another room--the knowledge that there are fifty
thousand Aryan brothers, itching to rebel, within a stoneâ€™s throw--and
two lone protectors of an alien race intent on torturing a High Priest,
each and every one of these is a disturbing feature. No woman, and least
of all a young woman such as Ruth Bellairs, can be blamed for being
nervous under the stress of such conditions or for displaying a certain
amount of feminine unreasonableness.
She stood shivering for a minute and watched spellbound while Mahommed
Khan held the hot coal closer and even closer to the High Priestâ€™s naked
foot. The priest writhed in anticipation of the agony and turned his
eyes away, and as he turned them they met Ruthâ€™s. High priests of a
religion that includes sooth-saying and prophecy and bribery of gods
among its rites are students of human nature, and especially of female
human nature. Knowledge of it and of how it may be gulled, and when,
is the first essential of their calling. Her pale face, her blue eyes
strained in terror, the parted lips and the attitude of tension, these
gave him an idea. Before the charcoal touched him, he screamed--screamed
like a wounded horse.
â€œMahommed Khan, stop! Stop this instant! I wonâ€™t have it! I wonâ€™t have

But the priest, it seemed, had formed a new idea. He had been looking

He stirred again among the charcoal with his tongs, and Ruth and the
High Priest both shuddered.

direction. It was the first word that he had addressed to them. It
took them by surprise, and the Risaldar and his half-brother turned and
looked. Their breath left them.
Framed in the yellow lamplight, her thin, hot-weather garments draped
about her like a morning mist, Ruth stood and stared straight back at
them through frightened eyes. Her blue-black hair, which had become
loosened in her excitement, hung in a long plait over one shoulder and
gleamed in the lampâ€™s reflection. Her skin took on a faintly golden
color from the feeble light, and her face seemed stamped with fear,
anxiety, pity and suffering, all at once, that strangely enhanced her
beauty, silhouetted as she was against the blackness of the wall behind,
she seemed to be standing in an aura, shimmering with radiated light.
NA
stood still like men dumfounded, and stared and stared and stared.
They knew Kharvaniâ€™s temple. Who was there in Hanadra, Christian or
Mohammedan or Hindu, who did not? The show-building of the city, the
ancient, gloomy, wonderful erection where bats lived in the dome and
flitted round Kharvaniâ€™s image, the place where every one must go who
needed favors of the priests, the central hub of treason and intrigue,
where every plot was hatched and every rumor had its origin--the
ultimate, mazy, greedy, undisgorging goal of every bribe and every
blackmail-wrung rupee!
They knew, too, as every one must know who has ever been inside the
place, the amazing, awe-inspiring picture of Kharvani painted on the
inner wall; of Kharvani as she was idealized in the days when priests
believed in her and artists thought the labor of a lifetime well
employed in painting but one picture of her--Kharvani the sorrowful,
grieving for the wickedness of earth; Kharvani, Bride of Siva, ready to
intercede with Siva, the Destroyer, for the helpless, foolish, purblind
sons of man.
And here, before them, stood Kharvani--to the life!

your ideas; but, if you did it, I would never be able to look my husband

The Risaldar drew his arm away from her and began to pace the room.
The High Priest instantly began to speak to Ruth, whispering to her
hurriedly in Hindustanee, but she was too little acquainted with the
language to understand him.

They spoke together quickly in their own language, drawing aside and
muttering to each other. It was plain that the half-brother was
making some suggestion and that the Risaldar was questioning him and
cross-examining him about his plan, but neither Ruth nor the High Priest
could understand a word that either of them said. At the end of two
minutes or more, the Risaldar gave an order of some kind and the
half-brother grunted and left the room without another word, closing
the door noiselessly behind him. The Risaldar locked it again from the
inside and drew the bolt.

VI.
The most wonderful thing in history, pointing with the surest finger to
the trail of destiny, has been the fact that in every tremendous crisis
there have been leaders on the spot to meet it. It is not so wonderful
that there should be such men, for the world keeps growing better, and
it is more than likely that the men who have left their footprints in
the sands of time would compare to their own disadvantage with their
compeers of today. The wonderful thing is that the right men have been
in the right place at the right time. Scipio met Hannibal; Philip
of Spain was forced to meet Howard of Effingham and Drake; Napoleon
NA
to deal with him; and, in America, men like George Washington and Grant
and Lincoln seem, in the light of history, like timed, calculated,
controlling devices in an intricate machine. It was so when the Indian
Mutiny broke out. The struggle was unexpected. A handful of Europeans,
commissioned and enlisted in the ordinary way, with a view to trade, not
statesmanship, found themselves face to face at a minuteâ€™s notice with
armed and vengeful millions. Succor was a question of months, not days
or weeks. India was ablaze from end to end with rebel fires that had
been planned in secret through silent watchful years. The British force
was scattered here and there in unconnected details, and each detail
was suddenly cut off from every other one by men who had been trained to
fight by the British themselves and who were not afraid to die.
The suddenness with which the outbreak came was one of the chief assets
of the rebels, for they were able to seize guns and military stores and
ammunition at the very start of things, before the British force could
concentrate. Their hour could scarcely have been better chosen. The
Crimean War was barely over. Practically the whole of Englandâ€™s standing
army was abroad and decimated by battle and disease. At home, politics
had England by the throat; the income-tax was on a Napoleonic scale and
men were more bent on worsting one another than on equipping armies.
They had had enough of war.
India was isolated, at the rebelsâ€™ mercy, so it seemed. There were no
railway trains to make swift movements of troops possible. Distances
were reckoned by the hundred miles--of sun-baked, thirsty dust in
the hot weather, and of mud in the rainy season. There were no
telegraph-wires, and the British had to cope with the mysterious,
and even yet unsolved, native means of sending news--the so-called
NA
a pigeon flies. There was never a greater certainty or a more one-sided
struggle, at the start. The only question seemed to be how many days,
or possibly weeks, would pass before jackals crunched the bones of every
Englishman in India.
But at the British helm was Nicholson, and under him were a hundred
other men whose courage and resource had been an unknown quantity until
the outbreak came. Nicholsonâ€™s was the guiding spirit, but it needed
only his generalship to fire all the others with that grim enthusiasm
that has pulled Great Britain out of so many other scrapes. Instead of
wasting time in marching and countermarching to relieve the scattered
posts, a swift, sudden swoop was made on Delhi, where the eggs of the
rebellion had hatched.
As many of the outposts as could be reached were told to fight their
own way in, and those that could not be reached were left to defend
themselves until the big blow had been struck at the heart of things.
If Delhi could be taken, the rebels would be paralyzed and the rescue of
beleaguered details would be easier; so, although odds of one hundred
or more to one are usually considered overlarge in wartime--when the
hundred hold the fort and the one must storm the gate--there was no time
lost in hesitation. Delhi was the goal; and from north and south and
east and west the men who could march marched, and those who could not
entrenched themselves, and made ready to die in the last ditch.
Some of the natives were loyal still. There were men like Risaldar
Mahommed Khan, who would have died ten deaths ten times over rather than
be false in one particular to the British Government. It was these men
who helped to make intercommunication possible, for they could carry
messages and sometimes get through unsuspected where a British soldier
would have been shot before he had ridden half a mile. Their loyalty was
put to the utmost test in that hour, for they can not have believed
that the British force could win. They knew the extent of what was out
against them and knew, too, what their fate would be in the event of
capture or defeat. There would be direr, slower vengeance wreaked on
them than on the alien British. But they had eaten British salt and
pledged their word, and nothing short of death could free them from it.
There was not a shred of self interest to actuate them; there could not
have been. Their given word was law and there it ended.
There were isolated commands, like that at Jundhra, that were too far
away to strike at Delhi and too large and too efficient to be shut in by
the mutineers. They were centers on their own account of isolated small
detachments, and each commander was given leave to act as he saw best,
provided that he acted and did it quickly. He could either march to the
relief of his detachments or call them in, but under no condition was he
to sit still and do nothing.
So, Colonel Carterâ€™s note addressed to O. C.--Jundhra only got
two-thirds of the way from Doonha. The gunner who rode with it was
brought to a sudden standstill by an advance-guard of British cavalry,
and two minutes later he found himself saluting and giving up his note
to the General Commanding. The rebels at Jundhra had been worsted and
scattered after an eight-hour fight, and General Turner had made up his
mind instantly to sweep down on Hanadra with all his force and relieve
the British garrison at Doonha on his way.
Jundhra was a small town and unhealthy. Hanadra was a large city, the
center of a province; and, from all accounts, Hanadra had not risen yet.
By seizing Hanadra before the mutineers had time to barricade themselves
inside it, he could paralyze the countryside, for in Hanadra were the
money and provisions and, above all, the Hindu priests who, in that
part of India at least, were the brains of the rebellion. So he burned
Jundhra, to make it useless to the rebels, and started for Hanadra with
every man and horse and gun and wagon and round of ammunition that he
had.
Now news in India travels like the wind, first one way and then another.
But, unlike the wind, it never whistles. Things happen and men know
it and the information spreads--invisible, intangible, inaudible, but
positive and, in nine cases out of ten, correct in detail. A government
can no more censor it, or divert it, or stop it on the way, than it can
stay the birthrate or tamper with the Great Monsoon.
First the priests knew it, then it filtered through the main bazaars
and from them on through the smaller streets. By the time that General
Turner had been two hours on the road with his command every man and
woman and child in Hanadra knew that the rebels had been beaten back
and that Hanadra was his objective. They knew, too, that the section had
reached Doonha, had relieved it and started back again. And yet not a
single rebel who had fought in either engagement was within twenty miles
of Hanadra yet!
In the old, low-ceilinged room above the archway Mahommed Khan paced
up and down and chewed at his black mustache, kicking his scabbard away
from him each time he turned and glowering at the priest.

at Ruth impatiently and execrate the squeamishness of women. Ruth sat
on the divan with her face between her hands, trying to force herself to
realize the full extent of her predicament and beat back the feeling of
hysteria that almost had her in its grip. The priest lay quiet. He was
in a torture of discomfort on the upturned table, but he preferred
not to give the Risaldar the satisfaction of knowing it. He eased his
position quietly from time to time as much as his bandages would let
him, but he made no complaint.
Suddenly, Ruth looked up. It had occurred to her that she was wasting
time and that if she were to fight off the depression that had seized
her she would be better occupied.

She pushed past him before he could prevent her, thrust the door back
and peered in.

The dim light from the lamp was filtering in past them, and her eyes
were slowly growing accustomed to the gloom. There was something lying
on the floor, in the middle of the room, that was bulky and shapeless
and unfamiliar.
NA
But there was no answer.

There was, something in the Rajputâ€™s voice that was strange, that hinted
at a darker meaning.

He crossed the room, brought it and stepped with it past Ruth, straight

He kicked the prostrate ayah, and, as the black face with the wide-open
bloodshot eyes and the protruding tongue rolled sidewise and the body
moved, a little heap of jewels fell upon the floor. Mahommed Khan
stooped down to gather them, bending, a little painfully, on one old
knee--but stopped half-way and turned. There was a thud behind him in
the doorway. Ruth Bellairs had fainted, and lay as the ayah had lain
when Risaldar had not yet locked her in the room.
He raised the lamp and studied her in silence for a minute, looking from
her to the bound priest and back to her again.

At that minute came a quiet knock. He set the tongs down again and
crossed the room and opened the door.

Mahommed Khan closed the door again behind his half-brother and turned
the key, but the half-brother shot the bolt home as well before he

â€œThis--she was to give a sign. She was not to slay. She had leave only
to take the jewels. Her orders were either to wait until she knew by
questioning that the section would not return or else, when it had
returned, to wait until the memsahib and Bellairs sahib slept, and then
to make a sign. They grow tired of waiting now, for there is news! At

â€œThey have time. From Jundhra to here is a long march! Until tomorrow

NA
There were voices plainly audible in the courtyard down below, and
two more men stood at the foot of the winding stairway whispering. By
listening intently they could hear almost what they said, for the stone
stairway acted like a whispering-gallery, the voices echoing up it from
wall to wall.
NA
â€œThey have sought elsewhere and not found him; and there is talk--He

Mahommed Khan glared at the trussed-up priest and swore a savage oath
beneath his breath.

â€œNo, not yet. The loot is to be divided evenly among certain of the

The voices down the stairs grew louder, and the sound of footsteps began
ascending, slowly and with hesitation.
NA
Charcoal lights quickly, and before the steps had reached the landing
Mahommed Khan had a hot coal glowing in his tongs:
NA
NA
The priest shut his lips tight and shook his head. With rescue so near
as that, he could see no reason to obey. But the hot coal touched him,
and a Hindu who may be not at all afraid to die can not stand torture.
NA
NA
the priestâ€™s language, which none--and least of all a Risaldar--can
understand except the priests themselves, he began to shout directions,
pitching his voice into a high, wailing, minor key. He was answered by
another sing-song voice outside the door and he listened with a glowing
coal held six inches from his eyes.
NA
forfeit unless they go down the stairs again! Then my half-brother here
will follow to the temple and if any watch, or stay behind, thy ears
NA
The High Priest raised his voice into a wail again, and the feet
shuffled along the landing and descended.
NA
NA
His giant half-brother peered from behind the curtain and listened. He
could hear laughter, ribald, mocking laughter, but low, and plainly not
intended for the High Priestâ€™s ears.
NA
NA
Once again the Risaldar was left alone with the priest and the
unconscious Ruth. She was suffering from the effects of long days and
nights of nerve-destroying heat, with the shock of unexpected horror
super-added, and she showed no disposition to recover consciousness. The
priest, though, was very far from having lost his power to think.

The Risaldar listened, for he could not help it, but he made no answer.
â€œMe you hold here, a prisoner. You can slay or torture. But what good
will that do? The woman that you guard will fall sooner or later into
Hindu hands. You can not fight against a legion. Listen! I hold the
strings of wealth. With a jerk I can unloose a fortune in your lap. I

â€œâ€˜For power! Kharvaniâ€™s temple here has images and paintings and a voice

The Rajput turned away again and affected unconcern.
â€œCould Kharvani but appear, could her worshipers but see Kharvani
manifest, what would a lakh, two lakhs, a crore of rupees mean to me,
the High Priest of her temple? I could give thee anything! The power
over all India would be in my hands! Kharvani would but appear and say
NA
The Risaldarâ€™s hand had risen to his mustache. His back was still turned
on the priest, but he showed interest. His eyes wandered to where Ruth
lay in a heap by the inner door and then away again.
NA
â€œThey would all believe it! One and all! Even Mohammedans would become
Hindus to worship at her shrine and beg her favors. Thou and I alone

Mahommed Khan turned. He stooped and cut them with his sword.
NA
â€œListen. Take thou two horses and gallop off, so that the rest may think
that the white woman has escaped. Then return here secretly and name thy

The Rajput was plainly wavering and the priest stood up, to argue with
him the better.
â€œWhat need to trust me? You, sahib, will know the secret, and none other
but myself will know it. Would I, think you, be fool enough to tell the
rest, or, by withholding just payment from you, incite you to spread it
broadcast? You and I will know it and we alone. To me the power that

The Risaldar drew off a clumsy silver ring, set with three stones--a
sapphire and a ruby and an emerald, each one of which was worth a
fortune by itself. He slipped it on his own finger and turned it round
slowly, examining it.

NA

He walked across the room to Ruth, tore a covering from a divan and
wrapped her in it; then he opened the outer door for his half-brother.

Again the Risaldar turned to the High Priest, and eyed him through eyes
that glittered.

VIII.
The guns rode first from Doonha, for the guns take precedence. The
section ground-scouts were acting scouts for the division, two hundred
yards ahead of every one. Behind the guns rode Colonel Forrester-Carter,
followed by the wagon with the wounded; and last of all the two
companies of the Thirty-third trudged through the stifling heat.
But, though the guns were ahead of every one, they had to suit their
pace to that of the men who marched. For one thing, there might be an
attack at any minute, and guns that are caught at close quarters at a
distance from their escort are apt to be astonishingly helpless. They
can act in unison with infantry; but alone, on bad ground, in the
darkness, and with their horses nearly too tired to drag them, a leash
of ten puppies in a crowd would be an easier thing to hurry with.
Young Bellairs had his men dismounted and walking by their mounts. Even
the drivers led their horses, for two had been taken from each gun to
drag the wounded, and the guns are calculated as a load for six, not
four.
As he trudged through the blood-hot dust in clumsy riding-boots and
led his charger on the left flank of the guns, Harry Bellairs fumed and
fretted in a way to make no man envy him. The gloomy, ghost-like trees,
that had flitted past him on the road to Doonha, crawled past him
now--slowly and more slowly as his tired feet blistered in his boots.
He could not mount and ride, though, for very shame, while his men were
marching, and he dared not let them ride, for fear the horses might give
in. He could just trudge and trudge, and hate himself and every one, and
wonder.
What had the Risaldar contrived to do? Why hadnâ€™t he packed up his
wifeâ€™s effects the moment that his orders came and ridden off with her
and the section at once, instead of waiting three hours or more for an
escort for her? Why hadnâ€™t he realized at once that orders that came in
a hurry that way, in the night-time, were not only urgent but ominous as
well? What chance had the Risaldar--an old man, however willing he might
be--to ride through a swarming countryside for thirty miles or more and
bring back an escort? Why, even supposing Mohammed Khan had ridden off
at once, he could scarcely be back again before the section! And what
would have happened in the meantime?
Supposing the Risaldarâ€™s sons and grandsons refused to obey him?
Stranger things than that had been known to happen! Suppose they were
disloyal? And then--blacker though than any yet!--suppose--suppose--
Why had Mahommed Khan, the hard-bitten, wise old war-dog, advised him
to leave his wife behind? Did that seem like honest advice, on second
thought? Mohammedans had joined in this outbreak as well as Hindus.
The sepoys at Doonha were Mohammedans! Why had Mahommed Khan seemed so
anxious to send him on his way? As though an extra five minutes
would have mattered! Why had he objected to a last good-by to Mrs.
Bellairs?... And then--he had shown a certain knowledge of the uprising;
where had he obtained it? If he were loyal, who then had told him of it?
Natives who are disloyal donâ€™t brag of their plans beforehand to men who
are on the other side! And if he had known of it, and was still loyal,
how was it that he had not divulged his information before the outbreak
came? Would a loyal man hold his tongue until the last minute? Scarcely!
He halted, pulled his horse to the middle of the road and waited for
Colonel Carter to overtake him.
NA
â€œCan I ride on ahead, sir? My horse is good for it and Iâ€™m in agonies of
NA
NA
â€œI beg your pardon, sir, but Iâ€™ve a sergeant who can take command. Heâ€™s
NA
NA
unkindly.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, sir, but Iâ€™m thinking that--that perhaps the Risaldar--I
mean--there seem to be Mohammedans at the bottom of this business, as
NA
â€œBellairs! Now hear me once and for all. You thank your God that the
Risaldar turned up to guard her! Thank God that your father was man
enough for Mahommed Khan to love and that you are your fatherâ€™s son! And
listen! Donâ€™t let me hear you, ever, under any circumstances, breathe a
word of doubt as to that manâ€™s loyalty! Dâ€™you understand me, sir? You,
a mere subaltern, a puppy just out of his â€˜teens, an insignificant
jackanapes with two twelve-pounders in your charge, daring to impute
disloyalty to Mahommed Khan!--your impudence! Remember this! That old
Risaldar is the man who rode with your father through the guns at Dera!
Heâ€™s a pauper without a pension, for all his loyalty, but he went down
the length of India to meet you, at his own expense, when you landed
raw-green from England! And what dâ€™you know of war, Iâ€™d like to know,
that you didnâ€™t learn from him? Thank your God, sir, that thereâ€™s
some one there whoâ€™ll kill your wife before she falls into the Hindusâ€™
NA
NA
NA
NA
So Harry Bellairs joined his section and trudged along sore-footed at
its side--sore-hearted, too. He wondered whether any one would ever say
as much for him as Colonel Carter had chosen to say for Mahommed Khan,
or whether any one would have the right to say it! He was ashamed of
having left his wife behind and tortured with anxiety--and smarting from
the snub--a medley of sensations that were more likely to make a man of
him, if he had known it, than the whole experience of a yearâ€™s campaign!
But in the dust and darkness, with the blisters on his heels, and fifty
men, who had overheard the colonel, looking sidewise at him, his plight
was pitiable.
They trudged until the dawn began to rise, bright yellow below the
drooping banian trees; only Colonel Carter and the advance-guard riding.
Then, when they stopped at a stream to water horses and let them graze
a bit and give the men a sorely needed rest, one of the ring of outposts
loosed off his rifle and shouted an alarm. They had formed square in an
instant, with the guns on one side and the men on three, and the colonel
and the wounded in the middle. A thousand or more of the mutineers
leaned on their rifles on the shoulder of a hill and looked them over, a
thousand yards away.
NA
gun barked out an overture, killing one sepoy. The rest made off in the
direction of Hanadra.
NA
Carter cheerily. â€œWell, weâ€™ll rest here for thirty minutes and give them
a chance to get ready for us. Iâ€™m sorry thereâ€™s no breakfast, men, but
the sepoys will have dinner ready by the time we get there--weâ€™ll eat
NA
The chorus of ready laughter had scarcely died away when a horseâ€™s
hoof-beats clattered in the distance from the direction of Doonha and a
native cavalryman galloped into view, low-bent above his horseâ€™s neck.
The foam from his horse was spattered over him and his lance swung
pointing upward from the sling. On his left side the polished scabbard
rose and fell in time to his horseâ€™s movement. He was urging his weary
horse to put out every ounce he had in him. He drew rein, though, when
he reached a turning in the road and saw the resting division in front
of him, and walked his horse forward, patting his sweat-wet neck and
easing him. But as he leaned to finger with the girths an ambushed
sepoy fired at him, and he rammed in his spurs again and rode like a man
possessed.
NA
a pointed undertone, and Bellairs blushed crimson underneath the tan.
â€œHeâ€™s ridden through from Jundhra, with torture waiting for him if he
happened to get caught, and no possible reward beyond his pay. Look out
NA
The trooper rode straight up to Colonel Carter and saluted. He removed
a tiny package from his cheek, where he had carried it so that he might
swallow it at once in case of accident, tore the oil-silk cover from
it and handed it to him without a word, saluting again and leading his
horse away. Colonel Carter unfolded the half-sheet of foreign notepaper
and read:
        Dear Colonel Carter:
        Your letter just received in which you say that you have blown
        up the magazine at Doonha and are marching to Hanadra with a
        view to the rescue of Mrs. Bellairs.  This is in no sense
        intended as a criticism of your action or of your plan, but
        circumstances have made it seem advisable for me to transfer
        my own headquarters to Hanadra and I am just starting.  I must
        ask you, please, to wait for me--at a spot as near to where
        this overtakes you as can be managed.  If Mrs. Bellairs, or
        anybody else of ours, is in Hanadra, she--or they--are either
        dead by now or else prisoners.  And if they are to be rescued
        by force, the larger the force employed the better.  If you
        were to attack with your two companies before I reached you,
        you probably would be repulsed, and would, I think, endanger
        the lives of any prisoners that the enemy may hold.  I am
        coming with my whole command as fast as possible.
                        Your Obedient Servant,
                                        A. E. Turner
                                        Genl. Officer Commanding
NA
slightest indication of his feelings, â€œweâ€™re to wait here for a while
until the whole division overtakes us. The general has vacated Jundhra.
NA
The murmur from the ranks was as difficult to read as Colonel Carterâ€™s
voice had been. It might have meant pleasure at the thought of rest,
or anger, or contempt, or almost anything. It was undefined and
indefinable.
But there was no doubt at all as to how young Bellairs felt. He was
sitting on a trunnion, sobbing, with his head bent low between his
hands.
IX.
NA
Mahommed Khan threw open the outer door and bowed sardonically.
NA

NA
NA
ahead of him.
NA
Risaldar. â€œBear her gently, Suliman! Have a care, now, as you turn on
NA
NA
she had been a little child.
At the foot of the stairway, in the blackness that seemed alive with
phantom shadows, the High Priest paused and listened, stretching out
his left hand against the wall to keep the other two behind him. From
somewhere beyond the courtyard came the din of hurrying sandaled feet,
scudding over cobblestones in one direction. The noise was incessant and
not unlike the murmur of a rapid stream. Occasionally a voice was raised
in some command or other, but the stream of sound continued, hurrying,
hurrying, shuffling along to the southward.
NA
NA
They climbed up a narrow stairway leading to a sort of battlement and
peered over the top, Suliman laying Ruth Bellairs down in the darkest
shadow he could find. She was beginning to recover consciousness, and
apparently Mahommed Khan judged it best to take no notice of her.
Down below them they could see the city gate, wide open, with a blazing
torch on either side of it, and through the gate, swarming like
ants before the rains, there poured an endless stream of humans that
marched--and marched--and marched; four, ten, fifteen abreast; all
heights and sizes, jumbled in and out among one another, anyhow, without
formation, but armed, every one of them, and all intent on marching
to the southward, where Jundhra and Doonha lay. Some muttered to one
another and some laughed, but the greater number marched in silence.
NA
NA
NA
English Lancers! They would ride through that as an ax does through the

NA
NA
NA
NA
They climbed down the steps again, the Rajput humming to himself and
smiling grimly into his mustache.
NA
NA
â€œI know not. How should I know, who have been thy guest these hours
NA
The priest pressed hard on a stone knob that seemed to be part of the
carving on a wall, then he leaned his weight against the wall and a huge
stone swung inward, while a fetid breath of air wafted outward in their
faces.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Down, down they climbed, one behind the other, Suliman grunting beneath
his burden and the Risaldar keeping up a running fire of oaths. Each
time that he slipped, and that was often, he cursed the priest and
cautioned Suliman. But the priest only laughed, and apparently Suliman
was sure-footed, for he never stumbled once. They seemed to be diving
down into the bowels of the earth. They were in pitch-black darkness,
for the stone had swung to behind them of its own accord. The wall on
either side of them was wet with slime and the stink of decaying ages
rose and almost stifled them. But the priest kept on descending, so fast
that the other two had trouble to keep up with him, and he hummed to
himself as though he knew the road and liked it.
NA
NA
But they could see nothing and hear nothing except their own footfalls
swishing in the ooze beneath them. Even the priestâ€™s words seemed to
be lost at once, as though he spoke into a blanket, for the air they
breathed was thicker than a mist and just as damp. They walked on, along
a level, wet, stone passage for at least five minutes, feeling their way
with one band on the wall.
NA
NA
Ruth was regaining consciousness. She began to move and tried once or
twice to speak.
NA
NA
The priest came back a step or two, but Suliman declined his aid,
snarling vile insults at him.
NA
NA
So Mahommed Khan came last, and they slipped and grunted upward, round
and round a spiral staircase that was hewn out of solid rock. No light
came through from anywhere to help them, but the priest climbed on, as
though he were accustomed to the stair and knew the way from constant
use. After five minutes of steady climbing the stone grew gradually dry.
The steps became smaller, too, and deeper, and not so hard to climb.
Suddenly the priest reached out his arm and pulled at something or other
that hung down in the darkness. A stone in the wall rolled open. A flood
of light burst in and nearly blinded them.
NA
through the opening into a four-square room hewn from the rock below the
foundations of the temple some time in the dawn of history. The light
that had blinded them when they first emerged proved to be nothing but
the flicker of two small oil lamps that hung suspended by brass chains
from the painted ceiling. The only furniture was mats spread on the
cut-stone floor.
NA
round the walls. There was not a door nor crack, nor any sign of one,
except that a wooden ladder in one corner led to a trapdoor overhead,
and they had certainly not entered by the ladder.
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhere else? No man but I knows of this crypt! The ladder there leads to
another room, where there is yet another ladder, and that one leads out
through a secret door I know of, straight into the temple. Art ready?
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAy. I have a son.
NA
NA
â€œNay, priest! Thy son lies gagged and bound and trussed in a place I

NA

The priestâ€™s face had blanched beneath the olive of his skin, and he
stared at Mahommed Khan through distended eyes.
NA
â€œAye! Thy priestling! He stays where he is, as hostage, until my return!
Also the heavenborn stays here! If, on my return, I find the heavenborn
safe and sound, I will exchange her for thy son--and if not, I will
tear thy son into little pieces before thy eyes, priest! Dost thou
NA
NA
NA
The priest turned and scampered up the ladder with an agility that was
astonishing in a man of his build and paunch.
NA
NA
But the priest had no time to answer him. He was half frantic with the
sickening fear of a father for his only son. He returned ten minutes
later, panting, and more scared than ever.
NA
â€œNay, priest! Shall I ride with her alone through that horde that
are marching through the gate? I go now for an escort; in
eight--ten--twelve--I know not how many hours, I will return for her,
and then--thy son will be exchanged for her, or he dies thus in many
NA
NA
NA
â€œThen tell her, when consciousness returns, that I have gone and will

NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œOne lakh of devils take thee and tear thee into little pieces! Wouldst

NA
â€œBe sure that the priestling will starve to death or die of thirst or

NA

Up with you! Up that ladder! Run! But, if the gods will, I will meet
NA
NA
Ten minutes later a crash and a clatter and a shower of sparks broke out
in the sweltering courtyard where the guns had stood and waited. It was
Shaitan, young Bellairsâ€™ Khaubuli charger, with his haunches under him,
plunging across the flagstones, through the black-dark archway, out
on the plain beyond--in answer to the long, sharp-roweled spurs of the
Risaldar Mahommed Khan.
X.
Dawn broke and the roofs of old Hanadra became resplendent with the
varied colors of turbans and pugrees and shawls. As though the rising
sun had loosed the spell, a myriad tongues, of women chiefly, rose in
a babel of clamor, and the few men who had been left in. Hanadra by
the nightâ€™s armed exodus came all together and growled prophetically in
undertones. Now was the day of days, when that part of India, at least,
should cast off the English yoke.
To the temple! The cry went up before the sun was fifteen minutes high.
There are a hundred temples in Hanadra, age-old all of them and carved
on the outside with strange images of heathen gods in high relief, like
molds turned inside out. But there is but one temple that that cry could
mean--Kharvaniâ€™s; and there could be but one meaning for the cry. Man,
woman and child would pray Kharvani, Bride of Siva the Destroyer, to
intercede with Siva and cause him to rise and smite the English. On the
skyline, glinting like flashed signals in the early sun, bright English
bayonets had appeared; and between them and Hanadra was a dense black
mass, the whole of old Hanadraâ€™s able-bodied manhood, lined up to
defend the city. Now was the time to pray. Fifty to one are by no means
despicable odds, but the aid of the gods as well is better!
So the huge dome of Kharvaniâ€™s temple began to echo to the sound of
slippered feet and awe-struck whisperings, and the big, dim auditorium
soon filled to overflowing. No light came in from the outer world.
There was nothing to illuminate the mysteries except the chain-hung
grease-lamps swinging here and there from beams, and they served only
to make the darkness visible. Bats flicked in and out between them
and disappeared in the echoing gloom above. Censers belched out
sweet-smelling, pungent clouds of sandalwood to drown the stench of hot
humanity; and the huge graven image of Kharvani--serene and smiling and
indifferent--stared round-eyed from the darkness.
Then a priestâ€™s voice boomed out in a solemn incantation and the
whispering hushed. He chanted age-old verses, whose very meaning was
forgotten in the womb of time--forgotten as the artist who had painted
the picture of idealized Kharvani on the wall. Ten priests, five on
either side of the tremendous idol, emerged chanting from the gloom
behind, and then a gong rang, sweetly, clearly, suddenly, and the
chanting ceased. Out stepped the High Priest from a niche below the
image, and his voice rose in a wailing, sing-song cadence that reechoed
from the dome and sent a thrill through every one who heard.
His chant had scarcely ceased when the temple door burst open and a man
rushed in.
NA
As though in ready confirmation of his words, the distant reverberating
boom of cannon filtered through the doorway from the world of grim
realities outside.
NA
 wailed he who brought the news. Again began the chanting that sought the
aid of Siva the Destroyer. Only, there were fewer who listened to this
second chant. Those who were near the doorway slipped outside and joined
the watching hundreds on the roofs.
For an hour the prayers continued in the stifling gloom, priest
relieving priest and chant following on chant, until the temple was half
emptied of its audience. One by one, and then by twos and threes, the
worshipers succumbed to human curiosity and crept stealthily outside to
watch.
Another messenger ran in and shouted: â€œThey have charged! Their cavalry
have charged! They are beaten back! Their dead lie twisted on the
NA
At the words there was a stampede from the doorway, and half of those
who had remained rushed out. There were hundreds still there, though,
for that great gloomy pile of Kharvaniâ€™s could hold an almost countless
crowd.
Within another hour the same man rushed to the door again and shouted:
â€œHelp comes! Horsemen are coming from the north! Rajputs, riding like
NA
But the chanting never ceased. No one stopped to doubt the friendship
of arrivals from the north, for to that side there were no English, and
Englandâ€™s friends would surely follow byroads to her aid. The city gates
were wide open to admit wounded or messengers or friends--with a view,
even, to a possible retreat--and whoever cared could ride through them
unchallenged and unchecked.
Even when the crash of horsesâ€™ hoofs rattled on the stone paving outside
the temple there was no suspicion. No move was made to find out who
it was who rode. But when the temple door reechoed to the thunder of a
NA
The chanting stopped and the priests and the High Priest listened to the
stamping on the stone pavement at the temple front.
NA
recommenced. Then some one drew the bolt and a horseâ€™s head--a huge
Khaubuli stallionâ€™s--appeared, snorting and panting and wild-eyed.
NA
Bellairsâ€™ winded charger.
NA
Straight into the temple, two by two, behind the Risaldar, rode two
fierce lines of Rajputs, overturning men and women--their drawn swords
pointing this way and that--their dark eyes gleaming. Without a word
to any one they rode up to the image, where the priests stood in an
astonished herd.
NA
was another clattering and stamping on the stone floor as the panting
chargers pranced into the fresh formation, back to back.

The Risaldar leaped from his horse and tossed his reins to the man
behind him. In a second his sword was at the High Priestâ€™s throat.
NA
The swordpoint pricked him. Two priests tried to interfere, but wilted
and collapsed with fright as four fierce, black-bearded Rajputs spurred
their horses forward. The swordpoint pricked still deeper.
NA
NA
The High Priest surrendered, with a dark and cunning look, though, that
hinted at something or other in reserve. He pulled at a piece of
carving on the wail behind and pointed to a stair that showed behind
the outswung door. Then he plucked another priest by the sleeve and
whispered.
The priest passed on the whisper. A third priest turned and ran.
NA
NA
NA
A growl like the distant rumble from a bear-pit answered him. Then Ruth
Bellairsâ€™ voice was heard calling up the stairway.
NA
NA
NA
She had recovered far enough to climb the ladder and the steep stone
stair above it, and Suliman climbed up behind her, grumbling dreadful
prophecies of what would happen to the priests now that Mohammed Khan
had come.
NA
â€œNay, heavenborn! All is not well yet! The general sahib from Jundhra

I did better than I thought, heavenborn. I come with four-and-twenty,

of the temple-doors. And in that instant he saw what the High Priestâ€™s
whispering had meant.
Coming up the street toward them was a horde of silent, hurrying Hindus,
armed with swords and spears, wearing all of them the caste-marks of
the Brahman--well-fed, indignant relations of the priests, intent on
avenging the defilement of Kharvaniâ€™s temple.
NA
Ruth found herself in the midst of a whirlwind of flashing sabers,
astride of a lean-flanked Katiawari gelding that could streak like
an antelope, knee to knee with a pair of bearded Rajputs, one of whom
gripped her bridle-rein--thundering down a city street straight for a
hundred swords that blocked her path. She set her eyes on the middle of
Mahommed Khanâ€™s straight back, gripped the saddle with both hands, set
her teeth and waited for the shock. Mahommed Khanâ€™s right arm rose and
his sword flashed in the sunlight as he stood up in his stirrups. She
shut her eyes. But there was no shock! There was the swish of whirling
steel, the thunder of hoofs, the sound of bodies falling. There was a
scream or two as well and a coarse-mouthed Rajput oath. But when she
dared to open her eyes once more they were thundering still, headlong
down the city street and Mahommed Khan was whirling his sword in mid-air
to shake the blood from it.
Ahead lay the city gate and she could see another swarm of Hindus
NA
again, and they swept through the crowd, through the half-shut gate, out
on the plain beyond, as a wind sweeps through the forest, leaving fallen
tree-trunks in its wake.
NA

He sat for a minute peering underneath his hand at the distant, dark,
serried mass of men and the steel-tipped lines beyond it, watching the
belching cannon and the spurting flames of the close-range rifle-fire.

He drew off the priestâ€™s ring, gave it to her and then, before she could
reply:

listen to the deep breathing of the Rajputs on either hand.
XI.
There could be no retreat that day and no thought of it. Jundhra and
Doonha were in ruins. The bridges were down behind them and Hanadra lay
ahead. The British had to win their way into it or perish. Tired out,
breakfastless, suffering from the baking heat, the long, thin
British line had got--not to hold at bay but to smash and pierce--an
over-whelming force of Hindus that was stiffened up and down its length
by small detachments of native soldiers who had mutinied.
Numbers were against them, and even superiority of weapons was not so
overwhelmingly in their favor, for those were the days of short-range
rifle-fire and smoothbore artillery, and one gun was considerably like
another. The mutinous sepoys had their rifles with them; there were
guns from the ramparts of Hanadra that were capable of quite efficient
service at close range; and practically every man in the dense-packed
rebel line had a firearm of some kind. It was only in cavalry and
discipline and pluck that the British force had the advantage, and the
cavalry had already charged once and had been repulsed.
General Turner rode up and down the sweltering firing-line, encouraging
the men when it seemed to him they needed it and giving directions to
his officers. He was hidden from view oftener than not by the
rolling clouds of smoke and he popped up here and there suddenly and
unexpectedly. Wherever he appeared there was an immediate stiffening
among the ranks, as though he carried a supply of spare enthusiasm with
him and could hand it out.
Colonel Carter, commanding the right wing, turned his head for a second
at the sound of a horseâ€™s feet and found the general beside him.
NA
NA
NA
NA
He spurred his horse over to where one of Bellairsâ€™ guns was being run
forward into place again and Colonel Carter followed him. There was
blood dripping from the muzzle of it.
NA
And as he spoke a gunner dipped his sponge into a pool of blood and
rammed it home.
Bellairs was standing between his two guns, looking like the shadow of
himself, worn out with lack of sleep, disheveled, wounded. There was
blood dripping from his forehead and he wore his left arm in a sling
made from his shirt.

â€œYes. Donâ€™t they? Iâ€™d like you to keep an eye on them. Theyâ€™ve come
up from the rear. I caught sight of them quite a while ago and I canâ€™t

to the enemy. Dâ€™you see?--there--theyâ€™ve changed direction. Theyâ€™re

He rode off, and Colonel Carter stared long and steadily at the
approaching horsemen. He saw a dense mass of the enemy, about a thousand
strong, detach itself from the left wing and move to intercept them, and
he noticed that the movement made a tremendous difference to the ranks
opposed to him. He stepped up to young Bellairs and touched his sleeve.
Bellairs started like a man roused from a dream.
NA
NA
Bellairs gripped the colonelâ€™s outstretched arm.
NA
â€œThere, man! There, where that mass of men is moving! Look! By the Lord
Harry! Heâ€™s charging right through the mob! Thatâ€™s Mahommed Khan, Iâ€™ll
NA
The bugler ran to him, and he began to puff into his instrument.
NA
Out rang the clear, strident notes, and the non-commissioned officers
and men took notice that a movement of some kind would shortly be
required of them, but the din of firing never ceased for a single
instant. Then, suddenly, an answering bugle sang out from the other
flank.
NA
best to split his cheeks in a battle-rending blast.
NA
NA
Six-and-twenty horsemen, riding full-tilt at a thousand men, may look
like a trifle, but they are disconcerting. What they hit, they kill; and
if they succeed in striking home, they play old Harry with formations.
And Risaldar Mahommed Khan did strike home. He changed direction
suddenly and, instead of using up his horsesâ€™ strength in outflanking
the enemy, who had marched to intercept him, and making a running target
of his small command, he did the unexpected--which is the one best thing
to do in war. He led his six-and-twenty at a headlong gallop straight
for the middle of the crowd--it could not be called by any military
name. They fired one ragged volley at him and then had no time to
load before he was in the middle of them, clashing right and left and
pressing forward. They gave way, right and left, before him, and a good
number of them ran. Half a hundred of them were cut down as they fled
toward their firing-line. At that second, just as the Risaldar and his
handful burst through the mob and the mob began rushing wildly out
of his way, the British bugles blared out the command to advance in
echelon.
The Indians were caught between a fire and a charge that they had good
reason to fear in front of them, and a disturbance on their left flank
that might mean anything. As one-half of them turned wildly to face what
might be coming from this unexpected quarter, the British troops came
on with a roar, and at the same moment Mahommed Khan reached the rear of
their firing-line and crashed headlong into it.
In a second the whole Indian line was in confusion and in another minute
it was in full retreat not knowing nor even guessing what had routed it.
Retreat grew into panic and panic to stampede and, five minutes after
the Risaldarâ€™s appearance on the scene, half of the Indian line was
rushing wildly for Hanadra and the other half was retiring sullenly in
comparatively dense and decent order.
Bellairs could not see all that happened. The smoke from his own guns
obscured the view, and the necessity for giving orders to his men
prevented him from watching as he would have wished. But he saw
the Rajputs burst out through the Indian ranks and he saw his own
charger--Shaitan the unmistakable--careering across the plain toward him
riderless.
NA
she got this far, and then been killed! Oh, what in Hades did I entrust
her to an Indian for? The pig-headed, brave old fool! Why couldnâ€™t he

As he groaned aloud, too wretched even to think of what his duty was, a
galloper rode up to him.

later his two guns were thundering up the rise.

to figure out the range, a finger touched his shoulder and he turned to
see another artillery officer standing by him.
NA
NA
â€œOver there, where you see Colonel Carter standing. Itâ€™s your wife wants
NA
Bellairs did not wait for explanations. He sent for his horse and
mounted and rode across the intervening space at a breakneck gallop that
he could barely stop in time to save himself from knocking the colonel
over. A second later he was in Ruthâ€™s arms.
NA

his young wife brought him out of the jaws of death. At least he has a
good excuse for it. The sting of the reproof left him bereft of words
and he stood looking down at the old Risaldar, saying nothing and
feeling very much ashamed.
NA

He waved Bellairs away with a motion of his hand and the lieutenant went
back to his wife again.
NA
NA
Colonel Carter bent down again above the Risaldar, and listened to as
much as he had time to tell of what had happened.
NA
â€œNay, sahib! It was touch and go! I gave the touch! I saw as I rode how
close the issue was and I saw my chance and took it! Had the memsahib

NA
NA
His sons were standing near him, but the colonel called up his
grandsons, who had been told to stand at a little distance off. They
clustered round the Risaldar in silence, and he looked them over and
counted them.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThis sahib says that having done my bidding and delivered her ye rode

There was no answer.

the ground beside him, but it was lifeless.
Risaldar Mahommed Khan, two-medal man and pensionless
gentleman-at-large, had gone to turn in his account of how he had
remembered the salt which he had eaten.

Waist-held in the chains and soused in the fifty-foot-high spray, Joe
Byng eyed his sounding lead that swung like a pendulum below him, and
named it sacrilege.

trotters wet, thatâ€™s what this is, so â€˜elp me two able seamen anâ€™ a red
NA
From the moment that the lookout, lashed to the windlass drum up
forward, had spied the little craft away to leeward and had bellowed his
report of it through hollowed hands between the thunder of the waves,
Joe Byng had had premonitory symptoms of uneasiness. He had felt in his
bones that the navy was about to be nose-led into shame.
At the wheel, both eyes on the compass, as the sea law bids, but both
ears on the more-even-than-usual-alert, Curley Crothers felt the same
sensations but expressed them otherwise.
NA
The brass gongs clanged down in the bowels of H.M.S. Puncher and she
gradually lost what little weigh she had, rolling her bridge ends under
in the heave and hollow of a beam-on monsoon sea.
NA
Joe Byng in the chains and Curley Crothers at the wheel both recognized
the quarter tone instantly, and diagnosed it with deadly accuracy;
every vibration of his voice and every fiber of his being expressed
exasperation, though a landsman might have noticed no more than contempt
NA
NA
NA
It is not much in the way of Persian Gulf Arabic that a man picks
up from textbooks but at garnering the business end of beach-born
dialects--the end that gets results at least expense of time
or energy--the Navy goes even the Army half a dozen better. The
sublieutenantâ€™s argument, bawled from the bridge rail to the reeling
little boat below, was a marvel in its own sweet way; it combined abuse
and scorn with a cataclysmic blast of threat in six explosive sentences.
NA
vestige of a smile.
NA
Two minutes later, during which the nasal howls from the boat were
utterly ignored, the acting chief engineer hauled himself along the rail

than usually big comber split against the Puncherâ€™s side and hove itself
to heaven.

His temper, judging by his voice, would seem to be a lot worse than
could be due to the pitching of the ship.
â€œYes. Thereâ€™s a pilot overside, and our orders are to take a pilot
aboard when running in, if available. There are three men bailing that
boat below there, and the seaâ€™s gaining on them. Theyâ€™ll need rescuing
within two hours. Then weâ€™d have a pilot aboard and would have saved the
government ten pounds. Point is, can you manage in the engine-room for
two or three hours longer? Three more waves like that last one and the

heel and toe to the Puncherâ€™s statelier swing. â€œYes; there are three men
bailing, and youâ€™re a genius. But no! The answerâ€™s no! The enginesâ€™ll
keep on turning, maybe and perhaps, until we make the shelter oâ€™ yon

Even crouched as he was against the canvas guard he contrived to shrug

Curley Crothers heard that and his whole frame stiffened; there seemed
a chance yet that the Navy might not be disgraced. But it faded on the
instant.

The sublieutenant hauled himself in turn to windward. Curley Crothers
gave the wheel a half-spoke and looked as if he had no interest in
anything. Joe Byng in the chains bowed his head and groaned inwardly;
his sticky, spray-washed lead seemed all-absorbing.
â€œTell that black robber to hurry aboard, unless he wants me to come in
NA
The little boat had drifted fast before the wind, and the sublieutenant
had to bellow through a megaphone to where the three men bailed and the
ragged oarsmen swung their weight against the storm. The man of ebony,
who would be pilot and disgrace the Navy, balanced on a thwart with
wide-spread naked toes and yelled an ululating answer. With his rags
out-blown in the monsoon he looked like a sea wraith come to life. The
big gongs clanged again, and the Puncher drifted rather than drove down
on the smaller craft. A hand line caught the pilot precisely in the
face. He grabbed it frantically, fell headlong in the sea, and was
hauled aboard.
NA
sublieutenant. â€œSaid it in English, too--seems he knows more than he
NA
NA
aloud but to himself. â€œWell--the bargainâ€™s made, so it canâ€™t be helped.
NA
The pilotâ€™s crew displayed no overdone affection for their craft, and
there was no struggle to the last to leave it. One by one--whichever
could grab the line first was the first to come--they were hauled
through the thundering waves and their boat was left to sink. Then,
before they could adjust their unaccustomed feet to the different
balance of the Puncherâ€™s heaving deck, the gongs clanged and the
destroyer leaped ahead like a dripping sea-soused water beetle, into her
utmost speed that instant.
All conscious of his new-won dignity, and utterly regardless of his
boat, the pilot had found the bridge at once. He clung to the rail there
and braced one naked foot against a stanchion. To him the shipâ€™s speed
seemed the all-absorbing thing, for either Mr. Hartley had forgotten
just how many revolutions would make fifteen knots or else he had
underestimated his engine-roomâ€™s capacity. The Puncher split the waves
and spewed them twenty feet above her, racing head-on for the reef,
and Curley Crothers was too busy at his wheel to pass the pilot the
surreptitious insult he intended.
The gongs clanged presently, and the Puncher swallowed half her speed at
once, giving the pilot courage.
NA
NA
Three words passed between the commander and Crothers, and the Puncher
hove a weed-draped underside high over the crest of a beam-on roller as
she veered a dozen points, ducked her starboard rail into the trough
of it, and sliced her long thin nose, sizzling and swirling, into the
welter ahead. It was growing weedier and dirtier each minute.
NA
And at the sound of his voice the pilot hauled himself up by his
leverage on the rail and found his voice again.
NA
But the commander was too busy acting all three Lâ€™s--Log, Lead and
Lookout--his shrouded figure swaying to the heave and fall and his eyes
fixed straight ahead of him on the double line of boiling foam. He had
conned his course and had it charted in his head. There was no time to
argue with a pilot.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Curley Crothers moved his wheel and the Puncherâ€™s bow yawed twenty feet,
as if Providence had pushed her.
NA
jagged rock that grinned up suddenly three waves away.
The pilot braced both feet against a stanchion and tried to take the
weigh off her by pulling.
â€œHalf speed, sah! Go slow, sah! Go dead slow, sah! Youâ€™ll pile up you-ah
damn ship, sah! Ah tell you, sah, youâ€™ll pile her up as suah as hell,

NA
NA
complaining engines danced ahead, the horrid gray beneath the pilotâ€™s
ebony notwithstanding.
NA
clanged like an echo to him, and the Puncherâ€™s speed was reduced at
once to her point, of minimum stability. She rolled and quivered like
a living thing in fear, falling on and off, nosing out a passage on her
own account apparently, and seeming to be gathering all her strength for
one tremendous effort.
â€œThatâ€™s bettah, sah! Thatâ€™s bettah, Captain, sah! Go astern! This
he-ahâ€™s the bar, sah--damn bad place, the bar, sah! Go astern, sah.
Captain, sah, dâ€™you he-ah me--go astern! Try again, â€˜nother place
further up, sah. Captain, sah! Over that way; that way thar--that way,
NA
He pointed through the sky-flung spray with a trembling finger and his
voice was rich with doleful emphasis, but the commander held his course
and carried on. There seemed neither sympathy nor understanding on
that unsteadiest of ships. Curley Crothers, solemn-faced as Nemesis and
looking half as compassionate, moved his wheel a trifle. Joe Byng in
the chains kept up his even sing-song, expressionless, as if he were an
automatic clock that did not care, but must record the truth each time
his dripping pendulum touched bottom.
NA
White foam was boiling in among the dirty welter, and the Puncherâ€™s bow
pitched suddenly as the first big bar wave lifted her; a second later
her propellers chug-chug-chugged in surface spume as she kicked upward
like a porpoise diving.

NA
NA

the foâ€™castle head, where a bosunâ€™s mate and his crew had climbed and
were awaiting orders in evident and most unreasonable unconcern.
NA
NA
proceeded at kaleidoscopic angles to defy the elements. The big steel
hooks were ready in an instant.
NA
The gongs clanged out an alarm and the throbbing ceased.
NA
Again there was a clangor under hatches, and the suffering bearings
shrieked. The Puncher dropped her stern two feet or so, and the foam
boiled brown round her propellers. The shock of the reversal pitched the
pilot up against the forward rail, where he clung like a drowning man.
â€œFor the love oâ€™ God, sah! Captain; sah, weâ€™ve struck! Ah told you so;
NA
NA
â€œStop her! Starboard engine ahead! Port engine ahead! Ease your helm!
NA
The Puncher pitched and rolled, kicking at the following monsoon that
thundered at her counter and tossing up the foam that seethed about her
bow. She trembled from end to end, as if the pounding of the water hurt
her.
NA
NA
NA
The Puncher leaped, as all destroyers do the second day they are loosed.
She sliced through the storm straight for the coral beach beyond the
bar, shaking her graceful shoulders free of the sticky spray--reeling,
rolling, thugging, kicking, bucking through the welter to where
quiet water waited and the ever-lasting, utterly unrighteous stink of
sun-baked Arab beaches. As each tremendous breaker thundered on her
stern each time she lifted to the underswell, the pilot vowed that
she had struck, rolling his eyes and calling two different deities to
witness that none of it was any fault of his.
â€œTharâ€™s no water, sah--no water, Captain, sah--not one drop! Youâ€™ve

NA
NA
NA
The Puncher was across the bar, gliding through muddy water on an even
keel and giving the lie direct to him whose fee was ten pounds English.
The pilot drew a talisman of some kind from underneath the least torn
portion of his shirt, and to the commanderâ€™s amazement kissed it. It is
not often that a woolly headed, or any other, native of the East kisses
either folk or things. But the commander was too busy at the moment to
ask questions.
NA
NA
The glittering, wet, wind-blown beach and the little estuary slid by
like a painted panorama smelling of all the evil in the world as the
Puncher eased her helm a time or two seeking a comfortable berth with
Joe Byngâ€™s chanted aid.

The pilot sighed relief as the starboard anchor splashed into the water
and the cable roared after it through the hawse pipe.

but official guest.

read about at school--of Christians in Neroâ€™s day being asked what their
religion was.

turning just in time to cause Crothers to withdraw his right leg.
The pilotâ€™s toes were, after all, not destined to be trodden on just
then.

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œOh! Are you? Um-m-m! Mr. White, give this man his ten pounds, will you?
NA
That appeared to end matters, so far as the commander was concerned;
official dignity forbade any further interest. But it was not so very
long since Mr. White was senior midshipman, and it takes a man until
he is admiral of the fleet to unlearn all he knew then and forget the
curiosity of those days.
NA
smiling, studying the salt-encrusted wrinkles on the ebony face. â€œYou

NA
Mr. White sent for whisky and poured out a stiff four fingers, to the
awful disgust of Curley Crothers, who saw the whole transaction. The
pilot consumed it so instantly that there seemed never to have been any
in the glass.
â€œI suppose your nameâ€™s Macnab--or Macphairson--which? Sign here,
NA
The pilot took the proffered pen in unaccustomed fingers and made a
crisscross scrawl, adorned with thirteen blots. The pen nib broke
under the strain, and he handed it back with an air of confidential
remonstrance.

â€œSo I see. Now tell me your name in full, so that I can write it next to

Ten minutes later the cutterâ€™s captain swung the boatâ€™s stern in shore

So Joe Byng, who was something of an expert in the way and ways of
dogs, departed in search of an oiler with whom he was on terms of
condescension; and he returned to the foâ€™castle a little later with
the nastiest, most awful-smelling mess that ever emanated even from the
engine-room of a destroyer in the Persian Gulf (where grease and things
run rancid.)

Lying lazily at anchor off the reeking beach of Adra Bight, the Puncher
looked peaceful and complacent--which is altogether opposite to what she
and her commander were, or had been, for a month. The ship hummed her
shut-in discontent, as a hive does when the bees propose to swarm, and
her commander--who never, be it noted, went to windward of the one word

abundant perspiration, and the acting engineer who stood in front of him
shifted from foot to foot in attitudes expressive of increasing agony
of mind. It grew obvious at last that there was a limit to Mr. Hartleyâ€™s
store of courteous deference.
There had been news, red hot but wrong, of dhows loaded to the
water-line with guns and ammunition somewhere up the Gulf. India, ever
fretful for her tribes beyond the border, had borrowed Applewaite and
his destroyer by instant cablegram, and jealously held records had been
broken while the Puncher quartered those indecent seas and heated up her
bearings. It was almost too much to have to come back empty-handed. It
was quite too much to have to run for shelter under the lee of Adraâ€™s
uninviting coral reef. And to be told by an acting engineer that
he would have to stay a week was utterly beyond the scope of polite
conversation.

coaxed, dragging by a short chain in his wake the sorriest-looking
bull terrier that ever acted mascot in the British or any other navy.
Courteous and huge and cap in hand, his weather-beaten face smiling
respectfully above a snow-white uniform, he took his stand before the
little table. His outward bearing was one of certainty, but his
shrewd, slightly puckered eyes alternately conned the expression of his
commanderâ€™s face and watched the dog.
The lee, scuppers were the goal of the dogâ€™s immediate ambition, for he
was a well-brought-up dog and such of the decencies as were not his by
instinct he had learned by painful and repeated acquisition. But at the

Curley Crothers made a gesture expressive of a world of compliment and
praise, but he kept one eye steadily on the dog; he seemed to imply
that but for the presence of the dog on board the commander might have
forgotten his seamanship.
NA
â€œSeeing the poor dogâ€™s sick, sir, and you and all of us so fond of him,
and all he needs is exercise, I thought perhaps as â€˜ow youâ€™d order me

There were almost tears in his voice as he tugged at the chain
surreptitiously, in a vain effort to produce the cataclysm that was
overdue. But for all his efforts to appear affected, his eyes were
smiling. So were his commanderâ€™s.

â€œWhy; he knows me too, sir, and between the two of us, weâ€™d manage him

Crothers tugged at the chain, and the unhappy dog drew away toward the
scuppers with all his remaining strength.

The argument had reached a crisis, and Curley realized it. Joking or
not, when the commander of a ship takes too long in reaching a decision
he generally does not reach a favorable one. The leash was tugged
again, this time with some severity. The martyred Scamp was drawn on
his protesting haunches close to the official table, that the commander
might have a better view of his distress. And then the expected
happened--voluminously.
Curley stood with an expression of wooden-headed, abject innocence on
his big, broad face, and looked straight in front of him.
NA
â€œSick. Good heavens! The dogâ€™s turning himself inside out! Thatâ€™s the
last time a thing like this happens; heâ€™s the last dog I ever take on

He dived into the foâ€™castle with the dog behind him, and there were
those who noticed that the terrierâ€™s whip-like tail no longer hugged his
stomach, but was waving to the world at large.
And thirty minutes later, as the Puncherâ€™s launch put off with Curley
and Joe Byng comfortably seated in the stern, it was obvious to any one
who cared to look that Scamp was the happiest and healthiest terrier in
Asia.

III.
Now an Arab would as soon allow a dog to lick his face as he would think
of eating pork in public with his women folk; so the bearded, hook-nosed
believers in the Prophet who looked down from the rock wall that lines
one side of Adra knew what to think of Curley and his friend Joe Byng
long before either of them realized that they were being watched.
Arrayed from head to ankles in spotless white, their black boots looking
blacker by comparison, they proceeded in the general direction of the
distant village, with the order and decorum of sea lords descending on
a dockyard for inspection purposes. The trackless sand proved hot
and sharp; the dog proved in poor condition from the voyage and the
morningâ€™s incidental martyrdom, and Byng was generous-hearted. He
picked up the dog and carried him; and Scamp displayed his gratitude in
customary canine way.
The comments of the watching Arabs would not fit into any story in the
world, and it is quite as well that Crothers and Joe Byng did not hear
them and could not have translated them, for in the other case trouble
would have started even sooner than it did. As it was, they tumbled and
maneuvered over unresisting sand through almost tangible stench to where
a gap in the ragged wall did duty as a gate. As they came nearer, a
banner with the star and crescent was displayed from the wall-top, but
no other sign was given that their coming was observed.
It was not until they had debouched (as Crothers termed it) to their
half-right front and had taken to a narrow one-man track that ran below
the wall that any over attention was paid them. Suddenly a hook-nosed
Asiatic gentleman emerged through the once-was gateway--a picture of
a Bible shepherd but for the long-barreled gun he carried instead of
crook--a brown shadow against brown masonry. He challenged them in
Arabic, and Curley Crothers answered him in Queen Victoriaâ€™s English
that all was well.
NA
NA
The man repeated whatever he had said before, this time with a gesture
of impatience.
NA
took the joint yell for a war cry, or a bunting call, or possibly the
heraldâ€™s overture that summons bull pups to Valhalla. He was bred right
and British Navy trained and his was not to reason why. He waited for
no second invitation, but lit out from Byngâ€™s arms like a streak--a
whip-tail, snow-white streak--for where the Arabâ€™s hard lean legs shone
shiny-brown below his fluttering brown raiment.
NA
called too late.
Each grabbed for the chain too late. Their heads and shoulders cannoned
and they fell together on the hot, dirty sand while Scamp and the Arab
made each otherâ€™s intimate acquaintance in a whirl of ripping cloth and
legs and teeth and blasphemy.
That in itself was bad enough, and good enough excuse if such were
wanted for war between the Shadow of God Upon Earth and Englandâ€™s
distant Queen; but there was worse to follow.
One does not laugh, between certain parallels, unless the ultimate
degree of insult is intended. And Curley Crothers and Joe Byng did
laugh. They held their ribs and laughed until their muscles ached and
their strong menâ€™s strength oozed out of them.
They were laughing when they grabbed the dog at last and pulled him off.
They laughed as they set the Arab on his feet and gave him back his gun;
and they laughed at him with Christian and mannerly good grace when he
spat at them in awful frenzy until the spittle matted in his beard.
And, being gentlemen after a fashion quite their own, they smilingly
apologized.
Arabia lies in the middle of the zone where laughter is not wisdom.
And a smile lies midway in the measure of a laugh. A laugh might be
unintentional. A smile must be deliberate. And the Arabâ€™s spittle was
run dry. Creed, custom, law of tooth for tooth and the thought of half
a hundred co-religionists all watching him from crannies in the wall
combined to make him shoot, since further means of showing malice were
denied him; and he raised the long butt to his shoulder with meaning
that was unmistakable.
And so, with sorrow that the East should be so lacking in good
fellowship, but with the ready instinct of men who have been trained for
war, they closed with him from two directions, swiftly, bull-dog-wise,
and took his gun away. And how could even an able seaman help the dogâ€™s
taking a share in the game again?
So far, nobody had done anything intended to be wrong--least of all the
dog. The Arab was defending institutions; Crothers and Joe Byng were
bent on holiday, and full of kind regards for anything that lived; and
the dog was living dogfully up to well-bred-terrier tradition. It was as
if two harmless chemicals had met and blended into nitroglycerin.
Deprived of his gun, the Arab drew a knife; and no British sailor lives
who does not understand the quick-loosed answer to the glint of steel.
Fist and boot both landed on the Arab quicker than his own thought
served the knife, and the weight of quick concussions jarred him into
all but coma. This time Byng caught the dog in time and held him back,
leaving Curley Crothers to finish matters by making the long knife prize
of war. Once more he helped the Arab on his feet, smiling hugely and
gentling the iron sinews with huge paws that could have wrenched them
all apart if need be.

The Arab was too apoplectically angry to comply, but Crothers took him
by both shoulders and shoved him; and finding himself shot forward
out of reach, seeing safety ahead and its possible corollary of awful
vengeance, he suddenly achieved discretion and scampered through the gap
in the wall.
NA
NA
NA
And the most amazing thing of all was that Crothers believed just what
he said--Curley Crothers, to whom Red Sea and Persian Gulf ports were
as an open book, and to whom the Arab customs and religion and
reprehensible tendencies were currently supposed to be first-reader
knowledge. It was he who had proved there were no harems--he who coined
the Navy adage, â€œSearch an Arab first, and sit on him, before you come

Yet here he was, advising Byng to disregard a looted Arabâ€™s spittle!
There is no accounting, ever, for the ways of shore-leave sailor-men.

IV.
All might have been well, and both seamen might have reached the Puncher
again with dignity and grace, had they not entered Adra, past the
only jail in that part of Arabia. And an Arab jail being rarer and one
percent more evil than any other evil thing there is, the two of them
quite naturally paused to make its closest possible acquaintance.
NA
through the close-spaced iron bars.
They forgot the dog. The jail, for the moment, challenged all their
waking senses, the olfactory by no means least.
NA
Before Crothers could answer him, a snarl, then a yap, then a quick,
determined growl gave warning of the terrierâ€™s interest in something
else than fleas.
He had been scratching himself peacefully a moment earlier; now, like a
bower anchor taking charge, he ripped the chain through Byngâ€™s hand and
was off--chin, back and tail in one straight, striving line--in full
chase of a pariah.
The yellow cur yapped its agony of fear; the nearest hundred and odd
mangy monsters of the gutter took up the chorus; within five seconds
of the start there was the Puncherâ€™s mascot racing after one abominable
scavenger, and after him in just as hot pursuit there raced the whole
street-cleaning force of Adra--tongues out, eyes blazing, and their mean
thin barks all working overtime.
NA
NA
tearing out the muscles.
It was a crude way of rousing Byngâ€™s latent speed, both of thought and
movement, but it worked. Before Joe could swear, even, Crothers was
off like the wind, with Joe after him, using the string of oaths he had
meant for Crothers on the sand that gave under him and made him stumble
at every other stride.
Adra turned out, as a colony of prairie dogs might from planless
burrows; only these had more venom in their bite than prairie dogs and
came from structural instead of natural, from flea-bepeppered instead of
grass-grown dirt. Man, woman and child--the grown men armed, the women
veiled in dirt-brown, some of them, and some (mostly the better-looking)
unveiled and unashamed, the little children mostly naked and colored
with all the human hues there are--raced, yelling, through a swarm of
flies in hot pursuit. Never since Shemâ€™s great-grandson gat the Arab
race was there a procession like it.
Behind its mud-and-Masonry decrepit wall that guards only the seaward
side, Adra straggles quite a distance desertward; and there are winding
streets enough to hide an army in, provided that the army did not mind
the fleas. Scamp, view-halloaing his utmost, led that most amazing hunt
a quite considerable circuit before other men and dogs, arriving from a
dozen different directions, set a limit to his unobstructed movement.
He knew what he was after, but they did not; they had come to see. For a
moment they seemed to think that Scamp was the object of the chase, and
a dozen guns of a dozen different kinds and dates were aimed at him.
And then, as consciousness dawns on a man recovering from chloroform,
there swept over their lethargic Eastern brains the simultaneous idea
that Curley Crothers and Joe Byng were the real quarry; and--again like
men recovering from chloroform--they did not quite know what to do.
Should they slay, there was the Puncher to be reckoned with; and the
Puncherâ€™s port quick-firers could be seen commanding Adra by any man who
cared to climb the wall.
Besides, an Arabâ€™s hospitality is proverbial. He very seldom kills a
visitor on sight.
On the other hand a man, and particularly a British sailor, who runs
has reason, as a rule. Therefore these two men were evidently guilty.
Therefore they must not escape. In five seconds the affair had changed
from a spectacular amusement, with Adraâ€™s population in the role of
super-heated audience, to a hunt of Crothers and Joe Byng.
Within ten seconds each of the sailors lay with his face pressed hard
into the sand and at least a dozen Arabs sitting on him. Scamp--utterly
forgotten now by all except the sailors--still behind the one stray
pariah and ahead of all the rest but beginning to appreciate the fact
that he was hunted, and beginning to feel spent--raced on, took three
sharp turns in close succession, and was gathered all unwilling in the
arms of an enormous black man who snatched him from the very teeth
of the following pack and dispersed them, howling, by means of
well-directed kicks.
NA
recalling principle, the terrier bit at him--only to find himself
muzzled by a horny, huge fist that caressed even while it rendered
impotent.
NA
Scamp understood nothing of the conversation, but with canine instinct
realized that he was safe; and after that he was satisfied to lie and
pant. With five red inches of tongue hanging out, and no sign whatever
of his white-uniformed guardians to trouble him, a black manâ€™s arms were
as good as any other place; he did not waste half a thought on Byng and
Crothers.
But Byng, three turnings back, spat filthy sand out of his mouth the
moment an Arab deemed it safe to leave off sitting on his head, looked
wildly around for Crothers, and bellowed--
NA
Crothers, spitting out sand, too, twenty yards behind where the swifter
Byng had fallen, called back:
NA
Byng tried to whistle, and the Arabs mistook the effort for a signal. In
an instant both men were face-downward again, struggling for breath
and clawing at the dirt. Then worse befell. The gentleman whose brown
anatomy had suffered from the seamenâ€™s feet and fists just previous to
their invasion of the town limped up with his eye teeth showing and his
flapping cotton raiment still unmended where the dog had torn it. Any
other wrath, however awful, could be nothing but the shadow of his state
of mind; and since he knew the more vindictive portions of the Koran all
by heart, and was quoting as he came, there was little need of words to
illustrate further his attitude.
He seemed to be a person of authority. An Arab town or village is a
democracy in which each free man has his say; not even a sheik can
overrule the vote of a majority, and this man was no sheik. But rage
and self-assertion will generally exercise a certain weight in tribal
councils, and the crowd in this case was too doubtful of the facts to
have any settled notions of its own.
NA
dozen in the crowd took up the cry--
NA
â€œInfidels! Worshipers of dogs! Wine-drinkers! Eaters of pig flesh! Dogs
and the sons of dogs--what mothers gave them birth? Are your hands,
True-believers, fit bonds for them? To the jail! To the jail that Abdul
NA
He stooped and looked deliberately to make sure that Crothers could not
break away, then came closer and spat on him, saving half his spittle
with impartial forethought for the struggling Byng, who looked up
in time to see what was in store for him. Being spat on is even less
exhilarating than it sounds or looks, and Byng waxed speechless after
passing through a many-worded stage of blasphemy.
Crothers, the larger of the two and by six brawny inches more
phlegmatic, bode his time in silence, so that neither of them spoke a
word while they were hustled and cuffed along the street between the
unbaked brick hovels. It was not until the reinforced iron door of
Adraâ€™s one stone building slammed on them that either of them said a
word.
Then--

Byng lay full length on his stomach, and buried his face in his arms. He
was still too full of wrath for words.
NA
And then he busied himself about conning his new bearings. It was a
four-walled jail--one-doored, one-windowed, iron-barred--ill-smelling,
verminous, too hot for words and too suggestive of the opposite of home,
sweet home to call forth humor, even from a seaman.

Which shows no more than that Joe Byng in his sorrow overlooked a
circumstance or two. For instance, there were rings in the floor that
Crothers eyed with keen curiosity. They were anchored in the solid
blocks of stone.

V.
Arabia has some peculiarities, not all of them discreditable, which she
does not share with any other country. There is, for instance, the kind
custom that dictates the setting free of slaves when they have rendered
seven yearsâ€™ good service.
That rule (and it is rather rule than law) tends to eliminate all class
and color prejudice. Provided that a man will bow to Mecca three times
daily and refrain from pork and wine, he may wear whatever skin God gave
him and yet mingle with the best. He may even marry whom he will and
can afford; and he may be whatever his ability, ambition, and audacity
dictate.
And Hassan Ah had never been a slave, so he had even less to overcome
than might have been the case. He stalked Adra socially uncondemned
where once he had caught fish, groomed camels, and done other irritating
jobs. His old fish-catching days had given him an intimate acquaintance
with the reef, and his small-boat seamanship, born of hard pulling in
the trough of beam-on-seas, was well suited to the local type of craft.
So nobody questioned his right to the title of harbor pilot. And if
certain perquisites went with an otherwise barren office, that was to
be expected. Who worked for nothing, or for the empty honor of it, in
Arabia?
Nobody can pass the reef at night in shallow-draft lateen-sail boats
without having him on board; and though he was never ostensibly paid
for his services, it was understood that he performed pilot service in
return for certain other opportunities that sometimes came his way. When
things happened on the high sea that were not discussed in public, it
was understood that Hassan Ah could have discussed them as thoroughly as
anybody if he chose.
On the whole, then, and within limits that were only more or less
definable, he was something of a personality. Men listened to him when
he raised his voice in argument, and as one who could grant favors on
occasion his words had weight.
The sun was very nearly in its zenith, beating down on dry Arabia
between racing black clouds, when he had finished talking to the local
council in the ramshackle old council-house, skin and mat curtained,
that faced the sheikâ€™s where the main street broadened for a hundred
filthy yards into a market-place. All through his argument he had held a
pure-white bull terrier between his knees as proof that he knew whereof
he spoke.
NA
did not seem to care to try.
NA
expressions of contentment from the dog in proof of it.
So the others in the stuffy council place gave the dog a wide berth and
no privilege, but conceded him the right to hold the beast, if he wanted
to, without personal defilement. And since the way of the world is that
a man who has won the first of his contentions can win all the rest
with half the ease, he persuaded them with a hurricane of black manâ€™s
rhetoric to do what Arabs consider almost wicked.
Unbelievers who are prisoners should die, beyond all question.
â€œAs the dregs of oil shall the fruit of the tree of Al Zakkum boil in

Unlike the more enlightened peoples of the West, Arabs do not encourage
the mutilation of their mother-tongue; they teach it as carefully as
they talk it, and this negro spoke like an Arab of the blood.

If he had intended to add further arguments, the sheik saw fit to nip
them in the bud; for there were some men in the council-room who did not
know as much as Hassan Ah. Any free man may speak in council in Arabia.
NA
The woolly headed pilot laughed aloud, taking care to make it evident
that he was laughing at the prisoners; to laugh at a sheik or a sheikâ€™s
bewilderment would be too dangerous.

The black man laughed again, and rose to lean against the wall behind
him, gathering the dog up in his arms.

 asked the sheik.
NA
The sheik took a vote on it. Heads nodded solemnly all around the room
as his eyes sought each half-veiled face in turn. His own face was
almost altogether shielded by the brown linen head-dress, for men of
his race like to reach a judgment unobserved. They were all nods that
answered him, and he saw fit to keep his own opinion to himself.
â€œThou seest? These others are all with thee. Have it thine own way,
Hassan Ah. Unlock thou the riddle and on thy head be the answer! Thou
NA
So Hassan Ah set out undaunted for the jail, with a terrier in tow
behind him and a huge smile on his broad-beamed face. And behind him a
murmur rose that:
â€œIt was well. He brought the warship in, instead of leaving it outside
or--as any wise man would have done--wrecking it on the outer reef,
where it could have been plundered at discretion. Let him send the

And within a minute of the pilotâ€™s arrival at the window of the jail
(through which he peered for two minutes before speaking) the whole
of Adraâ€™s council, followed by the cityâ€™s children in a noisy horde,
proceeded in a cluster after him and took up position, each as he saw
fit, at different vantage points.
Then Hassan Ah shook a loose bar of the window until it rattled, and so
called attention to himself. Crothers and Joe Byng raced for the window
neck and neck, and reached it simultaneously.
NA
leaped up at the window as both men swore at once.
â€œYou pass him in here! Come on, you black-faced cornerman! Thereâ€™ll be
a cutterâ€™s crew ashore pretty soon to rescue us, and if you donâ€™t hand
that dog over before they get here youâ€™ll get the worst whipping you

But to Byngâ€™s amazement Hassan Ah pointed to Crothers, who was heavier

Hassan Ah produced his key and turned it in the creaking lock. He was
stripping himself even before the two sailors were out in the sun, and
by the time that Crothers and Joe Byng had realized that there was
an audience of something like a thousand, including children, he was
standing posed like a gladiator, with the straight-down tropic sun
streaming off his ebony hide. As Crothers, not quite sure even yet that
the whole affair was not a joke, began to doff his blouse it dawned on
him that if the thing were true it would not be a picnic.
NA
NA
That, of course, settled matters. The thing was not a joke, and
Englishman or nigger--black, green, white, or gray--the plot must be
licked forthwith and in accordance with the rules.
Crothers spat into his hands, while Joe Byng folded up his blouse and
knelt on it. He eyed his antagonist for at least a minute, summing him
up and ignoring none of the woolly-headed oneâ€™s physical advantages in
weight and strength, in height and reach, in being used to the climate
and the glare, the odds were all with Hassan Ah. Then he sized up the
moral odds; and though a biased audience might be at first supposed to
weigh against him too, the sight of all those Arabs waiting to see him
beaten roused his fighting dander.

â€œAh represent maself! Ahâ€™m English! Ah fight English, and Ahâ€™ll prove

as he could get what he was after.

of the British Navy.
Oh! It was a fight! Crothers knew what he was up against the instant
that his left fist slid along an ebony forearm and his nose collided
with what seemed like an iron club. Steamship pilot this man might not
be, but fighting man he very surely was. He hit straight and guarded
high. He was no untutored savage. He had the hardest to acquire of all
the Christian arts at his fingersâ€™ (or rather his fistsâ€™) ends, and
the heavyweight champion of Gosport took a double reef in his fighting
tactics while he sparred for time in which to recover from the shock
of that first blow. The claret was streaming down his face and he was
dizzy.
NA
It is always easier to see what should be done than to do it. The sand
was not slipping and giving under Joe Byngâ€™s feet, nor were his fists
and wrists aching from contact with hard ebony. To him the thing seemed
easy, and he was as anxious to get into the fight himself as was the
terrier that strained at his chain. But Crothers, who had won a hundred
fights at least in cleaner climes, fought canny and tried to make the
black man tire himself with wasted effort.
And the Arabs sat in silence, like a row of vultures waiting for the
end. Even the little children held their clamor and subsided into
motionless calm. There was not a movement along the roofs or the wall,
or in the rings of those who squatted. Arabia was spellbound, watching
something she had never seen before and trying to puzzle out the
wherefore of it. There were knives and guns available, yet these men
fought without weapons. The white contender had a friend, but the friend
did not join in. Why? Had Allah struck all three men mad? They sat
still to see the end, having no doubt but that it would prove to be a
judgment.
Curley Crothers was the first to close a round. He put an end to round
one at the end of three minutes by missing with a heavy right swing,
ducking to avoid terrific punishment, slipping in the yielding sand and
falling.

Curley had been getting out of practise on board ship; he had needed
waking up, and round one had done it for him. Round two and the six that

larger cities of the world would have paid out a fortune to have seen.
There was racial prejudice, and service pride, as well as the usual
decent manâ€™s desire to win to make a real mill of what might have been
nothing out of ordinary; and there were the quite considerable odds
against him that--after the first repulse--usually make men like
Crothers do their utmost.
Even the Arabs lost their stoicism while round two was under way.
Byng yelled, and the terrier yelped, but the Arabs only shifted their
position. That, though, was proof enough of their excitement; they
actually sighed in unison when Hassan Ah thrust his ungainly chin in the
way of a crushing right-hand smash, and laid his broad back on the sand.
After that it was slug-and-come-again with both of them, each getting
wilder as round succeeded round, but neither man obtaining much
advantage. Twice it was Crothers who went down; then he discovered a
soft spot in Hassanâ€™s ribs, and after that he kept the black man busy on
the desperate defensive.
There was no doubt of the end, then, barring accidents. Even Hassan Ah
could not have doubted it; but he did his black manâ€™s uttermost to put
it off, and he fought as gamely as anybody ever fought since prize-ring
rules were drafted. He did not foul, or take undue advantage once.
It was a plain, right-handed, battering-ram punch to the neck that ended
things, and Hassan Ah lay coughing on the sand with bulging eyes while
Joe Byng tended Curleyâ€™s hurts.

Hassan Ah searched in the tattered shirt that he had laid aside, and
pulled out a folded piece of paper after a lot of fumbling. He opened it
gingerly, and holding one corner of it displayed the rest with evident
intention not to allow it out of his grasp.

back with the marks of fighting on them; and the Puncher gave no further
signs of life until, some three I days later, her long-suffering engines
turned again and she departed through the channel that had brought her
in.
Then the sheik and three others and a certain Hassan Ah went down
at midnight to the jail and lifted with the aid of long poles
passed through the rings in them the largest floor stones of that
vermin-infested building. But the vermin did not trouble them. What they
were after and what they lifted out was the cases of guns and cartridges
the Puncher had contrived to miss.
