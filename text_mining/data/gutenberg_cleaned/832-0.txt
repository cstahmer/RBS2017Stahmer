HOW ROBIN HOOD BECAME AN OUTLAW
     List and hearken, gentlemen,
     That be of free-born blood,
     I shall you tell of a good yeoman,
     His name was Robin Hood.
     Robin was a proud outlaw,
     While as he walked on the ground.
     So courteous an outlaw as he was one
     Was never none else found.
In the days of good King Harry the Second of England--he of the warring
sons--there were certain forests in the north country set aside for the
Kingâ€™s hunting, and no man might shoot deer therein under penalty of
death. These forests were guarded by the Kingâ€™s Foresters, the chief
of whom, in each wood, was no mean man but equal in authority to the
Sheriff in his walled town, or even to my lord Bishop in his abbey.
One of the greatest of royal preserves was Sherwood and Barnesdale
forests near the two towns of Nottingham and Barnesdale. Here for some
years dwelt one Hugh Fitzooth as Head Forester, with his good wife and
son Robert. The boy had been born in Lockesley town--in the year 1160,
stern records say--and was often called Lockesley, or Rob of Lockesley.
He was a comely, well-knit stripling, and as soon as he was strong
enough to walk his chief delight was to go with his father into the
forest. As soon as his right arm received thew and sinew he learned to
draw the long bow and speed a true arrow. While on winter evenings his
greatest joy was to hear his father tell of bold Will oâ€™ the Green, the
outlaw, who for many summers defied the Kingâ€™s Foresters and feasted
with his men upon Kingâ€™s deer. And on other stormy days the boy learned
to whittle out a straight shaft for the long bow, and tip it with gray
goose feathers.
The fond mother sighed when she saw the boyâ€™s face light up at these
woodland tales. She was of gentle birth, and had hoped to see her son
famous at court or abbey. She taught him to read and to write, to doff
his cap without awkwardness and to answer directly and truthfully both
lord and peasant. But the boy, although he took kindly to these lessons
of breeding, was yet happiest when he had his beloved bow in hand and
strolled at will, listening to the murmur of the trees.
Two playmates had Rob in these gladsome early days. One was Will
Gamewell, his fatherâ€™s brotherâ€™s son, who lived at Gamewell Lodge, hard
by Nottingham town. The other was Marian Fitzwalter, only child of the
Earl of Huntingdon. The castle of Huntingdon could be seen from the top
of one of the tall trees in Sherwood; and on more than one bright day
Robâ€™s white signal from this tree told Marian that he awaited her there:
for you must know that Rob did not visit her at the castle. His father
and her father were enemies. Some people whispered that Hugh Fitzooth
was the rightful Earl of Huntingdon, but that he had been defrauded out
of his lands by Fitzwalter, who had won the Kingâ€™s favor by a crusade to
the Holy Land. But little cared Rob or Marian for this enmity, however
it had arisen. They knew that the great green--wood was open to them,
and that the wide, wide world was full of the scent of flowers and the
song of birds.
Days of youth speed all too swiftly, and troubled skies come all too
soon. Robâ€™s father had two other enemies besides Fitzwalter, in
the persons of the lean Sheriff of Nottingham and the fat Bishop of
Hereford. These three enemies one day got possession of the Kingâ€™s ear
and whispered therein to such good--or evil--purpose that Hugh Fitzooth
was removed from his post of Kingâ€™s Forester. He and his wife and Rob,
then a youth of nineteen, were descended upon, during a cold winterâ€™s
evening, and dispossessed without warning. The Sheriff arrested the
Forester for treason--of which, poor man, he was as guiltless as you or
I--and carried him to Nottingham jail. Rob and his mother were sheltered
over night in the jail, also, but next morning were roughly bade to go
about their business. Thereupon they turned for succor to their only
kinsman, Squire George of Gamewell, who sheltered them in all kindness.
But the shock, and the winter nightâ€™s journey, proved too much for
Dame Fitzooth. She had not been strong for some time before leaving the
forest. In less than two months she was no more. Rob felt as though his
heart was broken at this loss. But scarcely had the first spring flowers
begun to blossom upon her grave, when he met another crushing blow in
the loss of his father. That stern man had died in prison before his
accusers could agree upon the charges by which he was to be brought to
trial.
Two years passed by. Robâ€™s cousin Will was away at school; and Marianâ€™s
father, who had learned of her friendship with Rob, had sent his
daughter to the court of Queen Eleanor. So these years were lonely ones
to the orphaned lad. The bluff old Squire was kind to him, but secretly
could make nothing of one who went about brooding and as though seeking
for something he had lost. The truth is that Rob missed his old life
in the forest no less than his motherâ€™s gentleness, and his fatherâ€™s
companionship. Every time he twanged the string of the long bow against
his shoulder and heard the gray goose shaft sing, it told him of happy
days that he could not recall.
One morning as Rob came in to breakfast, his uncle greeted him with, â€œI
NA
draught of ale and set his pewter tankard down with a crash.
NA
â€œHere is a chance to exercise your good long bow and win a pretty prize.
The Fair is on at Nottingham, and the Sheriff proclaims an archerâ€™s
tournament. The best fellows are to have places with the Kingâ€™s
Foresters, and the one who shoots straightest of all will win for prize
a golden arrow--a useless bauble enough, but just the thing for your lady
NA
again with his tankard.
NA
said. â€œI should dearly love to let arrow fly alongside another man. And
a place among the Foresters is what I have long desired. Will you let me
NA
NA
would have had me make a clerk of you; but well I see that the greenwood
NA
 And the huge tankard came a third time into play.
The young man thanked his uncle for his good wishes, and set about
making preparations for the journey. He traveled lightly; but his yew
bow must needs have a new string, and his cloth-yard arrows must be of
the straightest and soundest.
One fine morning, a few days after, Rob might have been seen passing
by way of Lockesley through Sherwood Forest to Nottingham town. Briskly
walked he and gaily, for his hopes were high and never an enemy had he
in the wide world. But â€˜twas the very last morning in all his life
when he was to lack an enemy! For, as he went his way through Sherwood,
whistling a blithe tune, he came suddenly upon a group of Foresters,
making merry beneath the spreading branches of an oak-tree. They had a
huge meat pie before them and were washing down prodigious slices of it
with nut brown ale.
One glance at the leader and Rob knew at once that he had found
an enemy. â€˜Twas the man who had usurped his fatherâ€™s place as Head
Forester, and who had roughly turned his mother out in the snow. But
never a word said he for good or bad, and would have passed on his way,
had not this man, clearing his throat with a huge gulp, bellowed out:
â€œBy my troth, here is a pretty little archer! Where go you, my lad, with
that tupenny bow and toy arrows? Belike he would shoot at Nottingham
NA
A roar of laughter greeted this sally. Rob flushed, for he was mightily
proud of his shooting.
NA
NA
They laughed again loudly at this, and the leader said with frown:
â€œShow us some of your skill, and if you can hit the mark hereâ€™s twenty
silver pennies for you. But if you hit it not you are in for a sound
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Now at a little rise in the wood a herd of deer came grazing by, distant
full fivescore yards. They were Kingâ€™s deer, but at that distance seemed
safe from any harm. The Head Forester pointed to them.
â€œIf your young arm could speed a shaft for half that distance, Iâ€™d shoot
NA
NA
NA
And without more ado he tried the string of his long bow, placed a shaft
thereon, and drew it to his ear. A moment, and the quivering string sang
death as the shaft whistled across the glade. Another moment and the
leader of the herd leaped high in his tracks and fell prone, dyeing the
sward with his heartâ€™s blood.
A murmur of amazement swept through the Foresters, and then a growl of
rage. He that had wagered was angriest of all.
NA
Kingâ€™s deer, and by the laws of King Harry your head remains forfeit.
Talk not to me of pennies but get ye gone straight, and let me not look
NA
Robâ€™s blood boiled within him, and he uttered a rash speech. â€œI have
looked upon your face once too often already, my fine Forester. â€˜Tis you
NA
And with this he turned upon his heel and strode away.
The Forester heard his parting thrust with an oath. Red with rage he
seized his bow, strung an arrow, and without warning launched it full
afâ€™ Rob. Well was it for the latter that the Foresterâ€™s foot turned on a
twig at the critical instant, for as it was the arrow whizzed by his ear
so close as to take a stray strand of his hair with it. Rob turned upon
his assailant, now twoscore yards away.
NA
NA
Straight flew his answering shaft. The Head Forester gave one cry, then
fell face downward and lay still. His life had avenged Robâ€™s father, but
the son was outlawed. Forward he ran through the forest, before the
band could gather their scattered wits--still forward into the great
greenwood. The swaying trees seemed to open their arms to the wanderer,
and to welcome him home.
Toward the close of the same day, Rob paused hungry and weary at the
cottage of a poor widow who dwelt upon the outskirts of the forest. Now
this widow had often greeted him kindly in his boyhood days, giving him
to eat and drink. So he boldly entered her door. The old dame was right
glad to see him, and baked him cakes in the ashes, and had him rest and
tell her his story. Then she shook her head.
NA
despoiled and the rich ride over their bodies. My three sons have been
outlawed for shooting Kingâ€™s deer to keep us from starving, and now hide
in the wood. And they tell me that twoscore of as good men as ever drew
NA
NA
NA
NA
was no other way, she said: â€œMy sons will visit me to-night. Stay you
NA
So Rob stayed willingly to see the widowâ€™s sons that night, for they
were men after his own heart. And when they found that his mood was with
them, they made him swear an oath of fealty, and told him the haunt of
the band--a place he knew right well. Finally one of them said:
â€œBut the band lacks a leader--one who can use his head as well as
his hand. So we have agreed that he who has skill enough to go to
Nottingham, an outlaw, and win the prize at archery, shall be our
NA
NA
started to that self-same Fair, and all the Foresters, and all the
Sheriffâ€™s men in Christendom shall not stand between me and the center
NA
And though he was but barely grown he stood so straight and his eye
flashed with such fire that the three brothers seized his hand and
shouted:
â€œA Lockesley! a Lockesley! if you win the golden arrow you shall be
NA
So Rob fell to planning how he could disguise himself to go to
Nottingham town; for he knew that the Foresters had even then set a
price on his head in the market-place.
It was even as Rob had surmised. The Sheriff of Nottingham posted a
reward of two hundred pounds for the capture, dead or alive, of one
Robert Fitzooth, outlaw. And the crowds thronging the streets upon that
busy Fair day often paused to read the notice and talk together about
the death of the Head Forester.
But what with wrestling bouts and bouts with quarter-staves, and
wandering minstrels, there came up so many other things to talk about,
that the reward was forgotten for the nonce, and only the Foresters
and Sheriffâ€™s men watched the gates with diligence, the Sheriff indeed
spurring them to effort by offers of largess. His hatred of the father
had descended to the son.
The great event of the day came in the afternoon. It was the archerâ€™s
contest for the golden arrow, and twenty men stepped forth to shoot.
Among them was a beggar-man, a sorry looking fellow with leggings of
different colors, and brown scratched face and hands. Over a tawny shock
of hair he had a hood drawn, much like that of a monk. Slowly he limped
to his place in the line, while the mob shouted in derision. But the
contest was open to all comers, so no man said him nay.
Side by side with Rob--for it was he--stood a muscular fellow of swarthy
visage and with one eye hid by a green bandage. Him also the crowd
jeered, but he passed them by with indifference while he tried his bow
with practiced hand.
A great crowd had assembled in the amphitheater enclosing the lists. All
the gentry and populace of the surrounding country were gathered there
in eager expectancy. The central box contained the lean but pompous
Sheriff, his bejeweled wife, and their daughter, a supercilious young
woman enough, who, it was openly hinted, was hoping to receive the
golden arrow from the victor and thus be crowned queen of the day.
Next to the Sheriffâ€™s box was one occupied by the fat Bishop of
Hereford; while in the other side was a box wherein sat a girl whose
dark hair, dark eyes, and fair features caused Robâ€™s heart to leap.
â€˜Twas Maid Marian! She had come up for a visit from the Queenâ€™s court at
London town, and now sat demurely by her father the Earl of Huntingdon.
If Rob had been grimly resolved to win the arrow before, the sight of
her sweet face multiplied his determination an hundredfold. He felt his
muscles tightening into bands of steel, tense and true. Yet withal his
heart would throb, making him quake in a most unaccountable way.
Then the trumpet sounded, and the crowd became silent while the herald
announced the terms of the contest. The lists were open to all comers.
The first target was to be placed at thirty ells distance, and all those
who hit its center were allowed to shoot at the second target, placed
ten ells farther off. The third target was to be removed yet farther,
until the winner was proved. The winner was to receive the golden arrow,
and a place with the Kingâ€™s Foresters. He it was also who crowned the
queen of the day.
The trumpet sounded again, and the archers prepared to shoot. Rob looked
to his string, while the crowd smiled and whispered at the odd figure
he cut, with his vari-colored legs and little cape. But as the first man
shot, they grew silent.
The target was not so far but that twelve out of the twenty contestants
reached its inner circle. Rob shot sixth in the line and landed fairly,
being rewarded by an approving grunt from the man with the green
blinder, who shot seventh, and with apparent carelessness, yet true to
the bullâ€™s-eye.
The mob cheered and yelled themselves hoarse at this even marksmanship.
The trumpet sounded again, and a new target was set up at forty ells.
The first three archers again struck true, amid the loud applause of the
onlookers; for they were general favorites and expected to win. Indeed
â€˜twas whispered that each was backed by one of the three dignitaries
of the day. The fourth and fifth archers barely grazed the center. Rob
fitted his arrow quietly and with some confidence sped it unerringly
toward the shining circle.
NA
NA
NA
christened his neighbor, did not place his shaft just within the mark.
Again the crowd cheered wildly. Such shooting as this was not seen every
day in Nottingham town.
The other archers in this round were disconcerted by the preceding
shots, or unable to keep the pace. They missed one after another and
dropped moodily back, while the trumpet sounded for the third round, and
the target was set up fifty ells distant.
NA
comrade to him in the interval allowed for rest. â€œDo you wish me to
NA
NA
NA
scornfully to the three other archers who were surrounded by their
admirers, and were being made much of by retainers of the Sheriff, the
Bishop, and the Earl. From them his eye wandered toward Maid Marianâ€™s
booth. She had been watching him, it seemed, for their eyes met; then
hers were hastily averted.
NA
said smilingly, â€œand one more worthy the golden arrow than the Sheriffâ€™s
NA
Rob looked at him swiftly, and saw naught but kindliness in his glance.
NA
Now the archers prepared to shoot again, each with some little care. The
target seemed hardly larger than the inner ring had looked, at the first
trial. The first three sped their shafts, and while they were fair shots
they did not more than graze the inner circle.
Rob took his stand with some misgiving. Some flecking clouds overhead
made the light uncertain, and a handful of wind frolicked across the
range in a way quite disturbing to a bowmanâ€™s nerves. His eyes wandered
for a brief moment to the box wherein sat the dark-eyed girl. His heart
leaped! she met his glance and smiled at him reassuringly. And in that
moment he felt that she knew him despite his disguise and looked to him
to keep the honor of old Sherwood. He drew his bow firmly and, taking
advantage of a momentary lull in the breeze, launched the arrow straight
and true-singing across the range to the center of the target.
NA
who from jeering him were now his warm friends. â€œCan you beat that,
NA
The last archer smiled scornfully and made ready. He drew his bow with
ease and grace and, without seeming to study the course, released the
winged arrow. Forward it leaped toward the target, and all eyes followed
its flight. A loud uproar broke forth when it alighted, just without the
center and grazing the shaft sent by Rob. The stranger made a gesture
of surprise when his own eyes announced the result to him, but saw his
error. He had not allowed for the fickle gust of wind which seized the
arrow and carried it to one side. But for all that he was the first to
congratulate the victor.
NA
golden bauble and wished to win it in despite of the Sheriff for whom I
NA
he was lost in the crowd, before Rob could utter what it was upon his
lips to say, that he would shoot again with him.
And now the herald summoned Rob to the Sheriffâ€™s box to receive the
prize.
NA
NA
Marian sat near and was listening intently.
NA
Marian leaned back and smiled.
â€œWell, Rob the Stroller, with a little attention to your skin and
NA
the idea of entering my service.
â€œRob the Stroller has ever been a free man, my Lord, and desires no

The Sheriffâ€™s brow darkened, yet for the sake of his daughter and the
golden arrow, he dissembled.
NA
offered to the best of archers this day. You are awarded the prize. See
NA
At this point the herald nudged Rob and half inclined his head toward
the Sheriffâ€™s daughter, who sat with a thin smile upon her lips. But Rob
heeded him not. He took the arrow and strode to the next box where sat
Maid Marian.
NA
NA
NA
in her eye; and she placed the gleaming arrow in her hair, while the
NA
The Sheriff glowered furiously upon this ragged archer who had refused
his service, taken his prize without a word of thanks, and snubbed his
daughter. He would have spoken, but his proud daughter restrained him.
He called to his guard and bade them watch the beggar. But Rob had
already turned swiftly, lost himself in the throng, and headed straight
for the town gate.
That same evening within a forest glade a group of men--some twoscore
clad in Lincoln green--sat round a fire roasting venison and making
merry. Suddenly a twig crackled and they sprang to their feet and seized
their weapons.
NA
Instantly the three men stepped forward.
NA
men came and greeted him; for they had heard his story.
Then one of the widowâ€™s sons, Stout Will, stepped forth and said:
â€œComrades all, ye know that our band has sadly lacked a leader--one of
birth, breeding, and skill. Belike we have found that leader in this
young man. And I and my brothers have told him that the band would
choose that one who should bring the Sheriff to shame this day and
NA
The band gave assent.
NA
he.
Rob laughed. â€œIn truth I brought the Sheriff to shame for mine own
pleasure, and won his golden arrow to boot. But as to the prize ye must
NA
And seeing the men stood in doubt at this, he continued: â€œBut Iâ€™ll
gladly join your band, and you take me, as a common archer. For there
NA
Then stepped one forward from the rest, a tall swarthy man. And Rob
recognized him as the man with the green blinder; only this was now
removed, and his freed eye gleamed as stoutly as the other one.
NA
for your tale. You shamed the Sheriff eâ€™en as I had hoped to do; and we
can forego the golden arrow since it is in such fair hands. As to your
shooting and mine, we must let future days decide. But here I, Will
NA
Then good Will Stutely told the outlaws of Robâ€™s deeds, and gave him his
hand of fealty. And the widowâ€™s sons did likewise, and the other members
every one, right gladly; because Will Stutely had heretofore been the
truest bow in all the company. And they toasted him in nut brown ale,
and hailed him as their leader, by the name of Robin Hood. And he
accepted that name because Maid Marian had said it.
By the light of the camp-fire the band exchanged signs and passwords.
They gave Robin Hood a horn upon which he was to blow to summon them.
They swore, also, that while they might take money and goods from the
unjust rich, they would aid and befriend the poor and the helpless; and
that they would harm no woman, be she maid, wife, or widow. They swore
all this with solemn oaths, while they feasted about the ruddy blaze,
under the greenwood tree.
And that is how Robin Hood became an outlaw.
CHAPTER II
HOW ROBIN HOOD MET LITTLE JOHN
NA
     â€œIâ€™ll serve you with all my whole heart.
     My name is John Little, a man of good mettle,
NA
NA
     â€œAnd I will his godfather be:
     Prepare then a feast, and none of the least,
NA
All that summer Robin Hood and his merry men roamed in Sherwood Forest,
and the fame of their deeds ran abroad in the land. The Sheriff of
Nottingham waxed wroth at the report, but all his traps and excursions
failed to catch the outlaws. The poor people began by fearing them, but
when they found that the men in Lincoln green who answered Robin Hoodâ€™s
horn meant them no harm, but despoiled the oppressor to relieve the
oppressed, they â€˜gan to have great liking for them. And the band
increased by other stout hearts till by the end of the summer fourscore
good men and true had sworn fealty.
But the days of quiet which came on grew irksome to Robinâ€™s adventurous
spirit. Up rose he, one gay morn, and slung his quiver over his
shoulders.
NA
be seeing what the gay world looks like in the direction of Nottingham
town. But tarry ye behind in the borders of the forest, within earshot
NA
Thus saying he strode merrily forward to the edge of the wood, and
paused there a moment, his agile form erect, his brown locks flowing
and his brown eyes watching the road; and a goodly sight he made, as the
wind blew the ruddy color into his cheeks.
The highway led clear in the direction of the town, and thither he
boldly directed his steps. But at a bend in the road he knew of a
by-path leading across a brook which made the way nearer and less open,
into which he turned. As he approached the stream he saw that it had
become swollen by recent rains into quite a pretty torrent. The log
foot-bridge was still there, but at this end of it a puddle intervened
which could be crossed only with a leap, if you would not get your feet
wet.
But Robin cared little for such a handicap. Taking a running start, his
nimble legs carried him easily over and balanced neatly upon the end of
the broad log. But he was no sooner started across than he saw a tall
stranger coming from the other side. Thereupon Robin quickened his pace,
and the stranger did likewise, each thinking to cross first. Midway they
met, and neither would yield an inch.
NA
afraid, had not tended to mend his manners.
The stranger smiled. He was almost a head taller than the other.
NA
NA
NA
NA
His opponent budged not an inch, but laughed loudly. â€œNow by my
NA
speech, even if minded to it before; for this better man I have sought

NA
till I cut me a cudgel like unto that you have been twiddling in your
NA
his long bow and arrows, and cut him a stout staff of oak, straight,
knotless, and a good six feet in length. But still it was a full foot
shorter than his opponentâ€™s. Then back came he boldly.
NA
would have been an easier way with me. But there are other tunes in
NA
his head by way of practice. â€œSo make you ready for the tune I am about
NA
NA
Well was it for Robin that he was quick and nimble of foot; for the blow
that grazed a hairâ€™s breadth from his shoulder would have felled an ox.
Nevertheless while swerving to avoid this stroke, Robin was poising for
his own, and back came he forthwith--whack!
Whack! parried the other.
Whack! whack! whack! whack!
The fight waxed fast and furious. It was strength pitted against
subtlety, and the match was a merry one. The mighty blows of the
stranger went whistling around Robinâ€™s ducking head, while his own swift
undercuts were fain to give the other an attack of indigestion. Yet each
stood firmly in his place not moving backward or forward a foot for a
NA
seemed likely to knock one or the other off the narrow foot-bridge. The
giantâ€™s face was getting red, and his breath came snorting forth like
a bullâ€™s. He stepped forward with a furious onslaught to finish this
audacious fellow. Robin dodged his blows lightly, then sprang in swiftly
and unexpectedly and dealt the stranger such a blow upon the short ribs
that you would have sworn the tanner was trimming down his hides for
market.
The stranger reeled and came within an ace of falling, but regained his
footing right quickly.
NA
almost while he was yet staggering.
This blow was a lucky one. It caught Robin off his guard. His stick had
rested a moment while he looked to see the giant topple into the water,
when down came the other upon his head, whack! Robin saw more stars
in that one moment than all the astronomers have since discovered, and
forthwith he dropped neatly into the stream.
The cool rushing current quickly brought him to his senses, howbeit he
was still so dazed that he groped blindly for the swaying reeds to
pull himself up on the bank. His assailant could not forbear laughing
heartily at his plight, but was also quick to lend his aid. He thrust
down his long staff to Robin crying, â€œLay hold of that, an your fists
NA
Robin laid hold and was hauled to dry land for all the world like
a fish, except that the fish would never have come forth so wet and
dripping. He lay upon the warm bank for a space to regain his senses.
Then he sat up and gravely rubbed his pate.
NA
NA
Then he seized his horn, which lay near, and blew thereon three shrill
notes that echoed against the trees. A moment of silence ensued, and
then was heard the rustling of leaves and crackling of twigs like the
coming of many men; and forth from the glade burst a score or two of
stalwart yeomen, all clad in Lincoln green, like Robin, with good Will
Stutely and the widowâ€™s three sons at their head.

Thus chatting pleasantly the band turned back into the woodland and
sought their secluded dell, where the trees were the thickest, the moss
was the softest, and a secret path led to a cave, at once a retreat and
a stronghold. Here under a mighty oak they found the rest of the band,
some of whom had come in with a brace of fat does. And here they built
a ruddy fire and sat down to the meat and ale, Robin Hood in the center
with Will Stutely on the one hand and Little John on the other. And
Robin was right well pleased with the dayâ€™s adventure, even though he
had got a drubbing; for sore ribs and heads will heal, and â€˜tis not
every day that one can find a recruit as stout of bone and true of soul
as Little John.
CHAPTER III
HOW ROBIN HOOD TURNED BUTCHER, AND ENTERED THE SHERIFFâ€™S SERVICE
     The butcher he answered jolly Robin,
     â€œNo matter where I do dwell,

NA
The next morning the weather had turned ill, and Robin Hoodâ€™s band
stayed close to their dry and friendly cave. The third day brought a
diversion in the shape of a trap by a roving party of the Sheriffâ€™s men.
A fine stag had been struck down by one Of Will Stutelyâ€™s fellows, and
he and others had stepped forth from the covert to seize it, when twenty
bowmen from Nottingham appeared at the end of the glade. Down dropped
Willâ€™s men on all fours, barely in time to hear a shower of arrows
whistle above their heads. Then from behind the friendly trees they
sent back such a welcome that the Sheriffâ€™s men deemed it prudent not to
tarry in their steps. Two of them, in sooth, bore back unpleasant wounds
in their shoulders, from the encounter.
When they returned to town the Sheriff waxed red with rage.
NA

NA
What it was the Sheriff would see, he did not state. But he was to have
his wish granted in short space, and you and I will see how he profited
by it.
The fourth day and the one following this friendly bout, Little John was
missing. One of his men said that he saw him talking with a beggar, but
did not know whither they had gone. Two more days passed. Robin grew
uneasy. He did not doubt the faith of Little John, but he was fearful
lest a roving band of Foresters had captured him.
At last Robin could not remain quiet. Up sprang he, with bow and arrows,
and a short sword at his side.

Others of the band besought him to let them go with him, but he would
not.
NA

the west gate of the town, and ye may be of service ere to-morrow
NA
So saying he strode forward to the road leading to Nottingham, and stood
as before looking up and down to see if the way was clear. Back at a
bend in the road he heard a rumbling and a lumbering, when up drove
a stout butcher, whistling gaily, and driving a mare that sped slowly
enough because of the weight of meat with which the cart was loaded.
NA
NA
NA
where I dwell. I am but a simple butcher, and to Nottingham am I going,
my flesh to sell. â€˜Tis Fair week, and my beef and mutton should fetch a

fat priests and knights. But I am naught but a poor butcher, selling

Here he took from his girdle a well-filled purse, and continued, â€œI
would fain be a butcher, this day, and sell meat at Nottingham town.
Could you sell me your meat, your cart, your mare, and your good-will,
NA
NA
NA
reins in exchange for the purse.
NA
nonce. Take mine and scurry home quickly lest the Kingâ€™s Foresters try
NA
So saying he donned the butcherâ€™s blouse and apron, and, climbing into
the cart, drove merrily down the road to the town.
When he came to Nottingham he greeted the scowling gate-keeper blithely
and proceeded to the market-place. Boldly he led his shuffling horse to
the place where the butchers had their stalls.
He had no notion of the price to ask for his meat, but put on a foolish
and simple air as he called aloud his wares:
     â€œHark ye, lasses and dames, hark ye,
     Good meat come buy, come buy,
     Three penâ€™orths go for one penny,
NA
Now when the folk found what a simple butcher he was, they crowded
around his cart; for he really did sell three times as much for one
penny as was sold by the other butchers. And one or two serving-lasses
with twinkling eyes liked his comely face so well that they willingly
gave boot of a kiss.
But the other butchers were wroth when they found how he was taking
their trade; and they accordingly put their heads together.
One said, â€œHe is a prodigal and has sold his fatherâ€™s land, and this is
NA
Another said, â€œHe is a thief who has murdered a butcher, and stolen his
NA
Robin heard these sayings, but only laughed merrily and sang his song
the louder. His good-humor made the people laugh also and crowd round
his cart closely, shouting uproariously when some buxom lass submitted
to be kissed.
Then the butchers saw that they must meet craft with craft; and they
said to him, â€œCome, brother butcher, if you would sell meat with us, you
NA
NA
NA
NA
     â€œThat a butcher will deny.
     Iâ€™ll go with you, my brethren true,
NA
Whereupon, having sold all his meat, he left his horse and cart in
charge of a friendly hostler and prepared to follow his mates to the
Mansion House.
It was the Sheriffâ€™s custom to dine various guilds of the trade, from
time to time, on Fair days, for he got a pretty profit out of the fees
they paid him for the right to trade in the market-place. The Sheriff
was already come with great pomp into the banqueting room, when Robin
Hood and three or four butchers entered, and he greeted them all with
great condescension; and presently the whole of a large company was
seated at a table groaning beneath the good cheer of the feast.
Now the Sheriff bade Robin sit by his right hand, at the head of the
board; for one or two butchers had whispered to the official, â€œThat
fellow is a right mad blade, who yet made us much sport to-day. He sold
more meat for one penny than we could sell for three; and he gave extra
NA
some prodigal who knows not the value of goods, and may be plucked by a
NA
The Sheriff was will to pluck a prodigal with the next man, and he was
moreover glad to have a guest who promised to enliven the feast. So, as
I have told you, he placed Robin by his side, and he made much of him
and laughed boisterously at his jests; though sooth to say, the laugh
were come by easily, for Robin had never been in merrier mood, and his
quips and jests soon put the whole table at a roar.
Then my lord Bishop of Hereford came in, last of all, to say a ponderous
grace and take his seat on the other side of the Sheriff--the prelateâ€™s
fat body showing up in goodly contrast to the otherâ€™s lean bones.
After grace was said, and while the servants clattered in with the meat
platters, Robin stood up and said:
â€œAn amen say I to my lord Bishopâ€™s thanks! How, now, my fine fellows, be
merry and drink deep; for the shot Iâ€™ll pay ere I go my way, though it
cost me five pounds and more. So my lords and gentlemen all, spare not
NA
NA
NA

hundred horned beasts have I and my brothers, and none of them have we
been able to sell. That is why I have turned butcher. But I know not the

At this, the Sheriffâ€™s greed â€˜gan to rise. Since this fool _would_ be
plucked, thought he, why should not he do the plucking?
NA
â€œFive hundred and ten fat beasts by actual count, that I would sell for
a just figure. Aye, to him who will pay me in right money, would I sell

Was there ever such an idiot butcher? thought the Sheriff; and he so far
forgot his dignity as to nudge the Bishop in his fat ribs.
NA

At this generosity Robin was quite overcome, and fell to praising the
Sheriff to the skies, and telling him that he should not have cause to
forget the kindness.

than a mile therefrom at most. Will you not come and choose your own

This was a poser for Robin, since he liked not the idea of staying over
night at the Sheriffâ€™s house. He had hoped to appoint a meeting-place
for the other, but now saw that this might excite doubt. He looked
around at the company. By this time, you must know, the feast had
progressed far, and the butchers were deep in their cups. The Sheriff
and Robin had talked in a low voice, and my lord Bishop was almost
asleep.
NA
mouth than the door opened and a serving-man entered bearing tray of
mulled wine. At sight of the fellowâ€™s face, Robin gave an involuntary
start of surprise which was instantly checked. The other also saw him,
stood still a moment, and as if forgetting something turned about and
left the hall.
It was Little John.
A dozen questions flashed across Robinâ€™s mind, and he could find answer
for none of them. What was Little John doing in the Sheriffâ€™s house? Why
had he not told the band? Was he true to them? Would he betray him?
But these questions of distrust were dismissed from Robinâ€™s open mind
as soon as they had entered. He knew that Little John was faithful and
true.
He recovered his spirits and began again upon a vein of foolish banter,
for the amusement of the Sheriff and his guests, all being now merry
with wine.
NA
Robin mounted his chair and trolled forth:
     â€œA lass and a butcher of Nottingham
     Agreed â€˜twixt them for to wed.
     Says he, â€˜Iâ€™ll give ye the meat, fair dame,
NA
Then they joined in the chorus amid a pounding of cups upon the board:
     â€œWith a hey and a ho
     And a hey nonny no,
NA
While the song was at its height, Little John reappeared, with other
servants, and refilled the cups. He came up to Robin and, as if asking
him if he would have more wine, said softly, â€œMeet me in the pantry
NA
Robin nodded, and sang loudly. The day was already far spent, and
presently the company broke up with many hiccupy bows of the Sheriff and
little notice of the drowsy Bishop.
When the company was dispersed, the Sheriff bade a servant show Robin to
his room, and promised to see him at breakfast the next day.
Robin kept his word and met Little John that night, and the sheriff next
day; but Little John has been doing so much in the meantime that he must
be allowed a chapter to himself.
So let us turn to another story that was sung of, in the ballads of
olden time, and find out how Little John entered the Sheriffâ€™s service.
CHAPTER IV
HOW LITTLE JOHN ENTERED THE SHERIFFâ€™S SERVICE
     List and hearken, gentlemen,
     All ye that now be here,
     Of Little John, that was Knightâ€™s-man,
     Good mirth ye now shall hear.
It had come around another Fair day at Nottingham town, and folk crowded
there by all the gates. Goods of many kinds were displayed in gaily
colored booths, and at every cross-street a free show was in progress.
Here and there, stages had been erected for the play at quarter-staff, a
highly popular sport.
There was a fellow, one Eric of Lincoln, who was thought to be the
finest man with the staff for miles around. His feats were sung about in
ballads through all the shire. A great boaster was he withal, and to-day
he strutted about on one of these corner stages, and vaunted of his
prowess, and offered to crack any manâ€™s crown for a shilling. Several
had tried their skill with Eric, but he had soon sent them spinning in
no gentle manner, amid the jeers and laughter of the onlookers.
A beggar-man sat over against Ericâ€™s stage and grinned every time a pate
was cracked. He was an uncouth fellow, ragged and dirty and unshaven.
Eric caught sight of his leering face at one of his boasts--for there
was a lull in the game, because no man else wanted to come within reach
of Ericâ€™s blows. Eric, I say, noticed the beggar-man grinning at him
rather impudently, and turned toward him sharply.
NA
NA
The beggar-man still grinned. â€œI am always ready to mend my manners to
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œIt will pleasure me hugely to take a braggart down a notch, an some
NA
At this a score of idlers reached him their staves--being ready enough
to see another man have his head cracked, even if they wished to save
their own--and he took the stoutest and heaviest of all. He made a sorry
enough figure as he climbed awkwardly upon the stage, but when he had
gained it, he towered full half a head above the other, for all his
awkwardness. Nathless, he held his stick so clumsily that the crowd
laughed in great glee.
Now each man took his place and looked the other up and down, watching
warily for an opening. Only a moment stood they thus, for Eric, intent
on teaching this rash beggar a lesson and sweeping him speedily off the
stage, launched forth boldly and gave the other a sounding crack on the
shoulder. The beggar danced about, and made as though he would drop his
staff from very pain, while the crowd roared and Eric raised himself for
another crushing blow. But just then the awkward beggar came to life.
Straightening himself like a flash, he dealt Eric a back-handed blow,
the like of which he had never before seen. Down went the boaster to the
floor with a sounding thump, and the fickle people yelled and laughed
themselves purple; for it was a new sight to see Eric of Lincoln eating
dust.
But he was up again almost as soon as he had fallen, and right quickly
retreated to his own ringside to gather his wits and watch for an
opening. He saw instantly that he had no easy antagonist, and he came in
cautiously this time.
And now those who stood around saw the merriest game of quarter-staff
that was ever played inside the walls of Nottingham town. Both men
were on their guard and fenced with fine skill, being well matched in
prowess. Again and again did Eric seek to force an opening under the
otherâ€™s guard, and just as often were his blows parried. The beggar
stood sturdily in his tracks contenting himself with beating off the
attack. For a long time their blows met like the steady crackling of
some huge forest fire, and Eric strove to be wary, for he now knew that
the other had no mean wits or mettle. But he grew right mad at last, and
began to send down blows so fierce and fast that you would have sworn
a great hail-storm was pounding on the shingles over your head. Yet he
never so much as entered the tall beggarâ€™s guard.
Then at last the stranger saw his chance and changed his tune of
fighting. With one upward stroke he sent Ericâ€™s staff whirling through
the air. With another he tapped Eric on the head; and, with a third
broad swing, ere the other could recover himself, he swept him clear off
the stage, much as you would brush a fly off the window pane.
Now the people danced and shouted and made so much ado that the
shop-keepers left their stalls and others came running from every
direction. The victory of the queer beggar made him immensely popular.
Eric had been a great bully, and many had suffered defeat and insult
at his hands. So the ragged stranger found money and food and drink
everywhere at his disposal, and he feasted right comfortably till the
afternoon.
Then a long bow contest came on, and to it the beggar went with some of
his new friends. It was held in the same arena that Robin had formerly
entered; and again the Sheriff and lords and ladies graced the scene
with their presence, while the people crowded to their places.
When the archers had stepped forward, the herald rose and proclaimed the
rules of the game: how that each man should shoot three shots, and to
him who shot best the prize of a yoke of fat steers should belong.
A dozen keen-eyed bowmen were there, and among them some of the best
fellows in the Foresterâ€™s and Sheriffâ€™s companies. Down at the end of
the line towered the tall beggar-man, who must needs twang a bow-string
with the best of them.
The Sheriff noted his queer figure and asked: â€œWho is that ragged
NA
â€œâ€˜Tis he that hath but now so soundly cracked the crown of Eric of

The shooting presently began, and the targets soon showed a fine
reckoning. Last of all came the beggarâ€™s turn.
NA
NA
the lists with a slender peeled sapling which he stuck upright in the

But not an archer would risk his reputation on so small a target.
Whereupon the beggar drew his bow with seeming carelessness and split
the wand with his shaft.
NA
The Sheriff swore a full great oath, and said: â€œThis man is the best
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou are a sturdy fellow, Reynold Greenleaf, and deserve better apparel
than that you wear at present. Will you enter my service? I will give
you twenty marks a year, above your living, and three good suits of

â€œThree good suits, say you? Then right gladly will I enter your service,
NA
Then Reynold turned him about to the crowd and shouted: â€œHark ye, good
people, I have entered the Sheriffâ€™s service, and need not the yoke of
NA
At this the crowd shouted more merrily than ever, and threw their caps
high into the air. And none so popular a man had come to Nottingham town
in many a long day as this same Reynold Greenleaf.
Now you may have guessed, by this time, who Reynold Greenleaf really
was; so I shall tell you that he was none other than Little John. And
forth went he to the Sheriffâ€™s house, and entered his service. But it
was a sorry day for the Sheriff when he got his new man. For Little John
winked his shrewd eye and said softly to himself: â€œBy my faith, I shall
NA
Two days passed by. Little John, it must be confessed, did not make
a good servant. He insisted upon eating the Sheriffâ€™s best bread and
drinking his best wine, so that the steward waxed wroth. Nathless the
Sheriff held him in high esteem, and made great talk of taking him along
on the next hunting trip.
It was now the day of the banquet to the butchers, about which we have
already heard. The banquet hall, you must know, was not in the main
house, but connected with it by a corridor. All the servants were
bustling about making preparations for the feast, save only Little John,
who must needs lie abed the greater part of the day. But he presented
himself at last, when the dinner was half over; and being desirous
of seeing the guests for himself he went into the hall with the other
servants to pass the wine. First, however, I am afraid that some of
the wine passed his own lips while he went down the corridor. When he
entered the banqueting hall, whom should he see but Robin Hood himself.
We can imagine the start of surprise felt by each of these bold fellows
upon seeing the other in such strange company. But they kept their
secrets, as we have seen, and arranged to meet each other that same
night. Meanwhile, the proud Sheriff little knew that he harbored the two
chief outlaws of the whole countryside beneath his roof.
After the feast was over and night was beginning to advance, Little John
felt faint of stomach and remembered him that he had eaten nothing all
that day. Back went he to the pantry to see what eatables were laid by.
But there, locking up the stores for the night, stood the fat steward.
NA
NA
The steward looked grimly at him and rattled the keys at his girdle.
NA
eating. Since you have waited thus long to be hungry, you can eâ€™en take
NA
NA

Saying this he brushed past the steward and tried the door, but it
was locked fast; whereat the fat steward chuckled and jangled his keys
again.
Then was Little John right mad, and he brought down his huge fist on the
door-panel with a sledge-hammer blow that shivered an opening you could
thrust your hand into. Little John stooped and peered through the hole
to see what food lay within reach, when crack! went the stewardâ€™s keys
upon his crown, and the worthy danced around him playing a tattoo that
made Little Johnâ€™s ears ring. At this he turned upon the steward and
gave him such a rap that his back went nigh in two, and over went the
fat fellow rolling on the floor.
NA
NA
door without ceremony and brought to light a venison pasty and cold
roast pheasant--goodly sights to a hungry man. Placing these down on a
convenient shelf he fell to with right good will. So Little John ate and
drank as much as he would.
Now the Sheriff had in his kitchen a cook, a stout man and bold, who
heard the rumpus and came in to see how the land lay. There sat Little
John eating away for dear life, while the fat steward was rolled under
the table like a bundle of rags.
NA
NA
drew a good sword that hung at his side.
NA
thus between me and my meat. So defend yourself and see that you prove
NA
cook.
Then back and forth they clashed with sullen sound. The old ballad which
tells of their fight says that they thought nothing for to flee, but
stiffly for to stand. There they fought sore together, two miles away
and more, but neither might the other harm for the space of a full hour.
NA
ever yet I saw. What say you to resting a space and eating and drinking
NA
NA
and they both laid by their swords and fell to the food with hearty
will. The venison pasty soon disappeared, and the roast pheasant flew
at as lively a rate as ever the bird itself had sped. Then the warriors
rested a space and patted their stomachs, and smiled across at
each other like bosom friends; for a man when he as dined looks out
pleasantly upon the world.
NA
NA
NA
I protest you are my friend henceforth--what is the score we have to

NA
NA
NA
â€œThis bout we can settle in right good time. But just now I and my
master have need of you, and you can turn your stout blade to better

CHAPTER V
HOW THE SHERIFF LOST THREE GOOD SERVANTS AND FOUND THEM AGAIN

     And for the love of Little John

The cook gasped in amazement. This Robin Hood! and under the Sheriffâ€™s
very roof!

â€œThen Little John, or Reynold Greenleaf, I like you well, on my honor as

NA
must back to my own bed, lest some sleepy warden stumble upon me, and
I be forced to run him through. Lucky for you twain that wine flowed
so freely in the house to-day; else the noise of your combat would have
brought other onlookers besides Robin Hood. Now if ye would flee the

Verily, it is running your head into a noose. Come with us. The Sheriff
has set strict watch on all the gates, since â€˜tis Fair week, but I know
the warden at the west gate and could bring us through safely. To-morrow
NA
go through with no less escort than the Sheriff himself. Now do you,
Little John, and do you, Much the millerâ€™s son, go right speedily. In
the borders of the wood you will find my merry men. Tell them to kill
two fine harts against to-morrow eve, for we shall have great company
NA
And Robin left them as suddenly as he had come.
NA
farewell. But ere we go, it would seem a true pity to fail to take such
of the Sheriffâ€™s silver plate as will cause us to remember him, and also
NA
NA
Thereupon they got a great sack and filled it with silver plate from the
shelves where it would not at once be missed, and they swung the sack
between them, and away they went, out of the house, out of the town, and
into the friendly shelter of Sherwood Forest.
The next morning the servants were late astir in the Sheriffâ€™s house.
The steward awoke from a heavy sleep, but his cracked head was still in
such a whirl that he could not have sworn whether the Sheriff had ever
owned so much as one silver dish. So the theft went undiscovered for the
nonce.
Robin Hood met the Sheriff at breakfast, when his host soon spoke of
what was uppermost in his heart--the purchase of the fine herd of cattle
near Gamewell. â€˜Twas clear that a vision of them, purchased for twenty
paltry gold pieces, had been with him all through the night, in his
dreams. And Robin again appeared such a silly fellow that the Sheriff
saw no need of dissembling, but said that he was ready to start at once
to look at the herd.
Accordingly they set forth, Robin in his little butcherâ€™s cart, behind
the lean mare, and the Sheriff mounted on a horse. Out of Nottingham
town, through gates open wide, they proceeded, and took the hill road
leading through Sherwood Forest. And as they went on and plunged deeper
among the trees, Robin whistled blithely and sang snatches of tunes.
NA
silence of the woods was making him uneasy.
NA
â€œWhat is there to fear, when you have the Sheriff of Nottingham beside
NA
Robin scratched his head.
NA
 he said.
NA
NA
â€œBut Robin Hood himself was on this very road the last time I came to

The Sheriff started at the crackling of a twig under his horseâ€™s feet,
and looked around.
NA
â€œAye, that did I! He wanted the use of this mare and cart to drive to
NA
As he spoke he came to a turn in the road, and there before them stood a
herd of the Kingâ€™s deer, feeding. Robin pointed to them and continued:
â€œThere is my herd of cattle, good Master Sheriff! How do you like them?
NA
NA
well out of this forest, for I care not to see such herds as these, or
such faces as yours. Choose your own way, therefore, whoever you be, and
NA
NA
much pains to cultivate your company to forego it now so easily. Besides
I wish you to meet some of my friends and dine with me, since you have

So saying he clapped a horn on his lips and winded three merry notes.
The deer bounded away; and before the last of them was seen, there came
a running and a rustling, and out from behind covert and tree came full
twoscore of men, clad in Lincoln green, and bearing good yew bows in
their hands and short swords at their sides. Up they ran to Robin Hood
and doffed their caps to him respectfully, while the Sheriff sat still
from very amazement.
NA
with mock reverence before the Sheriff.
The Sheriff glared. It was Little John.
NA
NA
misserved of my dinner, when I was at your house. But we shall set you
NA
NA
NA
Then turning abruptly the whole company plunged into the heart of the
forest.
After twisting and turning till the Sheriffâ€™s bewildered head sat
dizzily upon his shoulders, the greenwood men passed through a narrow
alley amid the trees which led to a goodly open space flanked by
wide-spreading oaks. Under the largest of these a pleasant fire was
crackling, and near it two fine harts lay ready for cooking. Around the
blaze were gathered another company of yeomen quite as large as that
which came with Robin Hood. Up sprang they as the latter advanced and
saluted their leader with deference, but with hearty gladness to see him
back again.
That merry wag Will Stutely was in command; and when he saw the
palefaced Sheriff being led in like any culprit, he took his cloak and
laid it humbly upon the ground and besought the Sheriff to alight upon
it, as the ground of Sherwood was unused to such dignitaries.
NA
cook, whom I see with us, is preparing a feast worthy of our high guest,
NA
Then while the whole glade was filled with the savory smell of roasting
venison and fat capons, and brown pasties warmed beside the blaze,
and mulled wine sent forth a cordial fragrance, Robin Hood placed the
Sheriff upon a knoll beneath the largest oak and sat himself down by
him.
First stepped forward several pairs of men armed with the quarter-staff,
the widowâ€™s sons among them, and so skilfully did they thrust and parry
and beat down guards, that the Sheriff, who loved a good game as well as
any man, clapped his hands, forgetting where he was, and shouted, â€œWell
struck! well struck! Never have I seen such blows at all the Fairs of
NA
Then the best archers of the band set up a small wand at eightscore
paces distant, and thereon they affixed a wreath of green. And the
archers began to shoot; and he who shot not through the garland without
disturbing its leaves and tendrils was fain to submit to a good sound
buffet from Little John. But right cunning was the shooting, for the
men had spent a certain time in daily practice, and many were the shafts
which sped daintily through the circle. Nathless now and again some
luckless fellow would shoot awry and would be sent winding from a long
arm blow from the tall lieutenant while the glade roared with laughter.
And none more hearty a guffaw was given than came from the Sheriffâ€™s own
throat, for the spirit of the greenwood was upon him.
But presently his high mood was dashed. The company sat down to meat,
and the guest was treated to two more disturbing surprise. The cook came
forward to serve the food, when the Sheriff beheld in him his own former
servant, and one whom he supposed was at the moment in the scullery at
Nottingham.
Much the millerâ€™s son grinned by way of answer to the Sheriffâ€™s
amazement, and served the plates, and placed them before the party. Then
did the Sheriff gasp and fairly choke with rage. The service was his own
silverware from the Mansion House!
NA

But Robin Hood bade him pause.
NA
does service. The platters are but used to do your worship honor. And as
for your life, it is forfeit to your eagerness to buy my herd of cattle
so cheaply. Now sit you down again and make good cheer, Sheriff, for

So the Sheriff sat him down again, with the best face he could assume,
and soon the cookâ€™s viands were disappearing down his gullet as rapidly
as the next manâ€™s. And they feasted royally and clinked each otherâ€™s
cups until the sun had ceased to print the pattern of the leaves upon
the forest carpet.
Then the Sheriff arose and said: â€œI thank you, Robin Hood, one-time
butcher, and you, Little John, one-time beggar, and you, Much, one-time

Promises I make not as to how I shall requite you when next you come to
Nottingham, for I am in the Kingâ€™s service. So for the present the score
rests with you. But the shadows grow long and I must away, if you will
NA
Then Robin Hood and all his men arose and drank the Sheriffâ€™s health,
and Robin said: â€œIf you must needs go at once we will not detain
NA
NA
â€œYou forget that you came with me to-day to buy a herd of horned beasts;
NA
The Sheriff fidgeted like a small boy who has forgotten his lesson.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The Sheriff caught his breath. â€œBy my troth, are all these silver dishes

The outlaws roared heartily at this.
NA

the herd of cattle free for our own use--and the Kingâ€™s. But this little

NA
Then the twenty pieces of gold were paid over, and the Sheriff once more
prepared to depart.

And he took the Sheriffâ€™s horse by the bridle rein, and led him through
the lane and by many a thicket till the main road was reached.
NA

So saying he smote the nagâ€™s haunch, and off went the Sheriff upon the
road to Nottingham.
And that is how--you will find from many ballads that came to be sung
at the Sheriffâ€™s expense, and which are known even to the present
day--that, I say, is how the Sheriff lost three good servants and found
them again.
CHAPTER VI
HOW ROBIN HOOD MET WILL SCARLET
     The youngster was clothed in scarlet red
     In scarlet fine and gay;
     And he did frisk it oâ€™er the plain,
     And chanted a roundelay.
One fine morning, soon after the proud Sheriff had been brought to
grief, Robin Hood and Little John went strolling down a path through the
wood. It was not far from the foot--bridge where they had fought their
memorable battle; and by common impulse they directed their steps to
the brook to quench their thirst and rest them in the cool bushes. The
morning gave promise of a hot day. The road even by the brook was dusty.
So the cooling stream was very pleasing and grateful to their senses.
On each side of them, beyond the dusty highway, stretched out broad
fields of tender young corn. On the yon side of the fields uprose the
sturdy oaks and beeches and ashes of the forest; while at their feet
modest violets peeped out shyly and greeted the loiterers with an odor
which made the heart glad. Over on the far side of the brook in a tiny
bay floated three lily-pads; and from amid some clover blossoms on the
bank an industrious bee rose with the hum of busy contentment. It was a
day so brimful of quiet joy that the two friends lay flat on their
backs gazing up at the scurrying clouds, and neither caring to break the
silence.
Presently they heard some one coming up the road whistling gaily, as
though he owned the whole world and â€˜twas but made to whistle in. Anon
he chanted a roundelay with a merry note.
NA
NA
So they lay still, and in a minute more up came a smart stranger dressed
in scarlet and silk and wearing a jaunty hat with a curling cock feather
in it. His whole costume was of scarlet, from the feather to the silk
hosen on his legs. A goodly sword hung at his side, its scabbard all
embossed with tilting knights and weeping ladies. His hair was long and
yellow and hung clustering about his shoulders, for all the world like a
schoolgirlâ€™s; and he bore himself with as mincing a gait as the pertest
of them.
Little John clucked his teeth drolly at this sight. â€œBy my troth, a gay
NA
build for all his prettiness. Look you, those calves and thighs are well
rounded and straight. The arms, for all that gold-wrought cloak, hang
stoutly from full shoulders. I warrant you the fop can use his dainty
NA
NA
long-bow â€˜gainst a plugged shilling that he would run and bellow lustily
at sight of a quarter-staff. Stay you behind this bush and I will soon
get some rare sport out of him. Belike his silk purse may contain more
NA
So saying Robin Hood stepped forth briskly from the covert and planted
himself in the way of the scarlet stranger. The latter had walked
so slowly that he was scarce come to their resting-place; and now
on beholding Robin he neither slackened nor quickened his pace but
sauntered idly straight ahead, looking to the right and to the left,
with the finest air in the world, but never once at Robin.

The other smiled as sweetly as though a lady were paying him a
compliment.

NA
beginning to grow red under the collar. â€œNathless, I have other
arguments which may not be so pleasing to your dainty skin. Prithee,
NA
NA
â€œI am deeply sorrowful that I cannot show my purse to every rough lout
that asks to see it. But I really could not, as I have further need of

â€œNay that will I not! and â€˜twill go the harder with you if you do not

NA
The stranger thought a moment with his usual slowness, and eyed Robin
from head to foot. Then he unbuckled his scabbard, laid it and the sword
aside, and walked deliberately over to the oak thicket. Choosing from
among the shoots and saplings he found a stout little tree to his
liking, when he laid hold of it, without stopping to cut it, and gave a
tug. Up it came root and all, as though it were a stalk of corn, and the
stranger walked back trimming it as quietly as though pulling up trees
were the easiest thing in the world.
Little John from his hiding-place saw the feat, and could hardly
NA
NA
Whatever Robin thought upon seeing the strangerâ€™s strength, he uttered
not a word and budged not an inch. He only put his oak staff at parry as
the other took his stand.
There was a threefold surprise that day, by the brookside. The stranger
and Robin and Little John in the bushes all found a combat that upset
all reckoning. The stranger for all his easy strength and cool nerve
found an antagonist who met his blows with the skill of a woodman. Robin
found the stranger as hard to hit as though fenced in by an oak hedge.
While Little John rolled over and over in silent joy.
Back and forth swayed the fighters, their cudgels pounding this way and
that, knocking off splinters and bark, and threatening direst damage to
bone and muscle and skin. Back and forth they pranced kicking up a cloud
of dust and gasping for fresh air. From a little way off you would have
vowed that these two men were trying to put out a fire, so thickly
hung the cloud of battle over them. Thrice did Robin smite the scarlet
man--with such blows that a less stout fellow must have bowled over.
Only twice did the scarlet man smite Robin, but the second blow was
like to finish him. The first had been delivered over the knuckles, and
though â€˜twas a glancing stroke it well nigh broke Robinâ€™s fingers, so
that he could not easily raise his staff again. And while he was dancing
about in pain and muttering a dust-covered oath, the otherâ€™s staff came
swinging through the cloud at one side--zip!--and struck him under the
arm. Down went Robin as though he were a nine-pin--flat down into the
dust of the road. But despite the pain he was bounding up again like an
India rubber man to renew the attack, when Little John interfered.

NA
NA
while he was down. But if there be a whole nest of you hatching here by
the waterside, cluck out the other chicks and Iâ€™ll make shift to fight
NA
NA
and a gentleman. Iâ€™ll fight no more with you, for verily I feel sore in

Sooth to say, Robin did not look in good fighting trim. His clothes were
coated with dirt, one of his hosen had slipped halfway down from his
knee, the sleeve of his jerkin was split, and his face was streaked with
sweat and dirt. Little John eyed him drolly.
NA
NA
NA
believe the Scripture saying that all men are but dust, for it has
sifted me through and through and lined my gullet an inch deep. By your
NA
and hands.
All this while the stranger had been eyeing Robin attentively and
listening to his voice as though striving to recall it.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
battle need not have happened, for I came abroad to find you to-day, and
thought to have remembered your face and speech. Know you not me, Rob,
NA
NA
throwing his arms about the other in sheer affection. â€œWhat an ass I was
not to recognize you! But it has been years since we parted, and your
NA
Will embraced his cousin no less heartily.
NA
and strengthened much from the stripling with whom I used to run foot
NA
NA
dangerous company. And how left you mine uncle? and have you heard aught
NA
NA
that it lies nearest your heart. I saw Maid Marian not many weeks after
the great shooting at Nottingham, when you won her the golden arrow. She
prizes the bauble among her dearest possessions, though it has made her
an enemy in the Sheriffâ€™s proud daughter. Maid Marian bade me tell you,
if I ever saw you, that she must return to Queen Eleanorâ€™s court, but
she could never forget the happy days in the greenwood. As for the old
Squire, he is still hale and hearty, though rheumatic withal. He speaks
of you as a sad young dog, but for all that is secretly proud of your
skill at the bow and of the way you are pestering the Sheriff, whom
he likes not. â€˜Twas for my fatherâ€™s sake that I am now in the open, an
outlaw like yourself. He has had a steward, a surly fellow enough, who,
while I was away at school, boot-licked his way to favor until he lorded
it over the whole house. Then he grew right saucy and impudent, but my
father minded it not, deeming the fellow indispensable in managing the
estate. But when I came back it irked me sorely to see the fellow strut
about as though he owned the place. He was sly enough with me at first,
and would brow-beat the Squire only while I was out of earshot. It
chanced one day, however, that I heard loud voices through an open
window and paused to hearken. That vile servant called my father â€˜a
meddling old fool,â€™ â€˜Fool and meddler art thou thyself, varlet,â€™ I
shouted, springing through the window, â€˜_that_ for thy impudence!â€™ and
in my heat I smote him a blow mightier than I intended, for I have
some strength in mine arm. The fellow rolled over and never breathed
afterwards, I think I broke his neck or something the like. Then I knew
that the Sheriff would use this as a pretext to hound my father, if I
tarried. So I bade the Squire farewell and told him I would seek you in

NA
took it about as coolly as one could wish. To see you come tripping
along decked out in all your gay plumage and trolling forth a roundelay,
one would think you had not a care in all the world. Indeed I remarked

NA
hands again and swore to be true each to the other and to Robin Hoodâ€™s
men in Sherwood Forest.
CHAPTER VII
HOW ROBIN HOOD MET FRIAR TUCK
     The friar took Robin Hood on his back,
     Deep water he did bestride,
     And spake neither good word nor bad,
     Till he came at the other side.
In summer time when leaves grow green, and flowers are fresh and gay,
Robin Hood and his merry men were all disposed to play. Thus runs a
quaint old ballad which begins the next adventure. Then some would leap
and some would run and some try archery and some ply the quarter-staff
and some fall to with the good broad sword. Some again would try a round
at buffet and fisticuff; and thus by every variety of sport and exercise
they perfected themselves in skill and made the band and its prowess
well known throughout all England.
It had been a custom of Robin Hoodâ€™s to pick out the best men in all the
countryside. Whenever he heard of one more than usually skilled in
any feat of arms he would seek the man and test him in personal
encounter--which did not always end happily for Robin. And when he had
found a man to his liking he offered him service with the bold fellows
of Sherwood Forest.
Thus it came about that one day after a practice at shooting, in which
Little John struck down a hart at five hundred feet distance, Robin Hood
was fain to boast.

At this Will Scarlet laughed full roundly.
â€œThere lives a curtall friar in Fountainâ€™s Abbey--Tuck, by name--who can
NA
Robin pricked up his ears at this free speech.
NA
NA
And with his usual impetuosity he at once set about arming himself for
the adventure. On his head he placed a cap of steel. Underneath his
Lincoln green he wore a coat of chain metal. Then with sword and buckler
girded at his side he made a goodly show. But he also took with him his
stout yew bow and a sheaf of chosen arrows.
So he set forth upon his way with blithe heart; for it was a day when
the whole face of the earth seemed glad and rejoicing in pulsing life.
Steadily he pressed forward by winding ways till he came to a green
broad pasture land at whose edge flowed a stream dipping in and out
among the willows and rushes on the banks. A pleasant stream it was, but
it flowed calmly as though of some depth in the middle. Robin did not
fancy getting his feet wet, or his fine suit of mail rusted, so he
paused on the hither bank to rest and take his bearings.
As he sat down quietly under the shade of a drooping willow he heard
snatches of a jovial song floating to him from the farther side; then
came a sound of two menâ€™s voices arguing. One was upholding the
merits of hasty pudding and the other stood out stoutly for meat pie,
NA
NA
a hungry man! But, odds bodikins! did ever two men talk more alike than
NA
In truth Robin could well marvel at the speech, for the voices were
curiously alike.
Presently the willows parted on the other bank, and Robin could hardly
forebear laughing out right. His mystery was explained. It was not two
men who had done all this singing and talking, but one--and that one a
stout curtall friar who wore a long cloak over his portly frame, tied
with a cord in the middle. On his head was a knightâ€™s helmet, and in his
hand was a no more warlike weapon than a huge pasty pie, with which he
sat down by the waterâ€™s edge. His twofold argument was finished. The
meat pie had triumphed; and no wonder! for it was the present witness,
soon to give its own testimony.
But first the friar took off his helmet to cool his head, and a droll
picture he made. His head was as round as an apple, and eke as smooth in
spots. A fringe of close curling black hair grew round the base of his
skull, but his crown was bare and shiny as an egg. His cheeks also were
smooth and red and shiny; and his little gray eyes danced about with
the funniest air imaginable. You would not have blamed Robin Hood for
wanting to laugh, had you heard this serious two-faced talk and then
seen this jovial one-faced man. Good humor and fat living stood out all
over him; yet for all that he looked stout enough and able to take
care of himself with any man. His short neck was thick like that of a
Berkshire bull; his shoulders were set far back, and his arms sprouted
therefrom like two oak limbs. As he sat him down, the cloak fell apart
disclosing a sword and buckler as stout as Robinâ€™s own.
Nathless, Robin was not dismayed at sight of the weapons. Instead, his
heart fell within him when he saw the meat pie which was now in fair
way to be devoured before his very eyes; for the friar lost no time in
thrusting one hand deep into the pie, while he crossed himself with the
other.
Thereupon Robin seized his bow and fitted a shaft.
NA
NA
The other started at the unexpected greeting, and laid his hand upon
his sword. Then he looked up and beheld Robinâ€™s arrow pointing full upon
him.
NA
the brook. â€˜Tis our duty in life to help each other, and your keen shaft
NA
knight got him up gravely, though his eyes twinkled with a cunning
light, and laid aside his beloved pie and his cloak and his sword and
his buckler, and waded across the stream with waddling dignity. Then he
took Robin Hood upon his back and spoke neither good word nor bad till
he came to the other side.
Lightly leaped Robin off his back, and said, â€œI am much beholden to you,
NA
NA
faith you shall eâ€™en repay your score. Now mine own affairs, which are
of a spiritual kind and much more important than yours which are carnal,
lie on the other side of this stream. I see that you are a likely man
and one, moreover, who would not refuse to serve the church. I must
therefore pray of you that whatsoever I have done unto you, you will do
NA
Courteously enough was this said; but so suddenly had the friar drawn
his sword that Robin had no time to unsling his bow from his back,
whither he had placed it to avoid getting it wet, or to unfasten his
scabbard. So he was fain to temporize.
NA
NA
now that I have already wetted myself so sadly as to lay in a store of
NA
NA
buckler would be my undoing on the uncertain footing amidstream, to say
NA
NA
NA
NA
Robin bent his stout back and took him up even as he had promised.
Now the stones at the bottom of the stream were round and slippery, and
the current swept along strongly, waist-deep, in the middle. More-over
Robin had a heavier load than the other had borne, nor did he know the
ford. So he went stumbling along now stepping into a deep hole, now
stumbling over a boulder in a manner that threatened to unseat his rider
or plunge them both clear under current. But the fat friar hung on and
dug his heels into his steedâ€™s ribs in as gallant manner as if he were
riding in a tournament; while as for poor Robin the sweat ran down him
in torrents and he gasped like the winded horse he was. But at last he
managed to stagger out on the bank and deposit his unwieldy load.
No sooner had he set the friar down than he seized his own sword.
NA
â€œwhat say the Scriptures that you quote so glibly?--Be not weary of
well doing. You must carry me back again or I swear that I will make a

The friarâ€™s gray eyes once more twinkled with a cunning gleam that boded
no good to Robin; but his voice was as calm and courteous as ever.
NA

NA
So Robin mounted again in high glee, and carried his sword in his
hand, and went prepared to tarry upon the other side. But while he
was bethinking himself what great words to use, when he should arrive
thither, he felt himself slipping from the friarâ€™s broad back. He
clutched frantically to save himself but had too round a surface to
grasp, besides being hampered by his weapon. So down went he with a
loud splash into the middle of the stream, where the crafty friar had
conveyed him.
NA
NA
ado, while Robin thrashed and spluttered about until he made shift to
grasp a willow wand and thus haul himself ashore on the other side.
Then Robinâ€™s rage waxed furious, despite his wetting, and he took his
bow and his arrows and let fly one shaft after another at the worthy
friar. But they rattled harmlessly off his steel buckler, while he
laughed and minded them no more than if they had been hail-stones.
NA
NA
So Robin shot, and passing well, till all his arrows were gone, when
from very rage he began to revile him.
NA
reviler of good hasty pudding! Come but within reach of my sword
arm, and, friar or no friar, Iâ€™ll shave your tonsure closer than ever
NA
NA
cheap, and you may need your wind presently. An you would like a bout
NA
And with this speech the friar waded into the brook, sword in hand,
where he was met halfway by the impetuous outlaw.
Thereupon began a fierce and mighty battle. Up and down, in and out,
back and forth they fought. The swords flashed in the rays of the
declining sun and then met with a clash that would have shivered less
sturdy weapons or disarmed less sturdy wielders. Many a smart blow was
landed, but each perceived that the other wore an undercoat of linked
mail which might not be pierced. Nathless, their ribs ached at the force
of the blows. Once and again they paused by mutual consent and caught
breath and looked hard each at the other; for never had either met so
stout a fellow.
Finally in a furious onset of lunge and parry Robinâ€™s foot stepped on a
rolling stone, and he went down upon his knees. But his antagonist would
not take this advantage: he paused until Robin should get upon his feet.
NA
the fairest swordsman that I have met in many a long day. I would beg a
NA
NA
â€œGive me leave to set my horn to my mouth and blow three blasts
NA
NA
NA
Then, says the old ballad, Robin Hood set his horn to mouth and blew
mighty blasts; and half a hundred yeomen, bows bent, came raking over
the lee.
NA
NA
was come at last.
Then said the friar in his turn, â€œA boon, a boon, the like I gave to
you. Give me leave to set my fist to my mouth and whistle three blasts
NA
NA
The friar set his fist to his mouth and put the horn to shame by the
piercing whistles he blew; whereupon half a hundred great dogs came
running and jumping so swiftly that they had reached their bank as soon
as Robin Hoodâ€™s men had reached his side.
Then followed a rare foolish conflict. Stutely, Much, Little John
and the other outlaws began sending their arrows whizzing toward the
opposite bank; but the dogs, which were taught of the friar, dodged the
missiles cleverly and ran and fetched them back again, just as the dogs
of to-day catch sticks.
NA
amazed.
NA
NA
run up, and who now stood laughing heartily at the scene.
NA
NA
NA
to his pack, â€œby name Friar Tuck of Fountainâ€™s Dale. For seven years
have I tended the Abbey here, preached oâ€™ Sundays, and married and
christened and buried folk--and fought too, if need were; and if it
smacks not too much of boasting, I have not yet met the knight or
trooper or yeoman that I would yield before. But yours is a stout blade.
NA
â€œâ€˜Tis Robin Hood, the outlaw, who has been assisting you at this
NA
dripping garments. And at this sally the whole bad burst into a shout of
laughter, in which Robin and Friar Tuck joined.
NA
you indeed that famous yeoman? Then I like you well; and had I known you
earlier, would have both carried you across and shared my pasty pie with
NA
NA
me to be rude. Now, therefore, bring it and your dogs and repair with us
to the greenwood. We have need of you--with this message came I to-day
to seek you. We will build you a hermitage in Sherwood Forest, and you

CHAPTER VIII
HOW ALLAN-A-DALEâ€™S WOOING WAS PROSPERED
NA
NA
NA
NA
Friar Tuck and Much the millerâ€™s son soon became right good friends over
the steaming stew they jointly prepared for the merry men that evening.
Tuck was mightily pleased when he found a man in the forest who could
make pasties and who had cooked for no less person than the High Sheriff
himself. While Much marveled at the friarâ€™s knowledge of herbs and
simples and woodland things which savored a stew greatly. So they
gabbled together like two old gossips and, between them, made such a
tasty mess that Robin Hood and his stout followers were like never to
leave off eating. And the friar said grace too, with great unction, over
the food; and Robin said Amen! and that henceforth they were always to
have mass of Sundays.
So Robin walked forth into the wood that evening with his stomach full
and his heart, therefore, in great contentment and love for other men.
He did not stop the first passer-by, as his manner often was, and desire
a fight. Instead, he stepped behind a tree, when he heard a manâ€™s voice
in song, and waited to behold the singer. Perhaps he remembered, also,
the merry chanting of Will Scarlet, and how he had tried to give it
pause a few days before.
Like Will, this fellow was clad in scarlet, though he did not look quite
as fine a gentleman. Nathless, he was a sturdy yeoman of honest face and
a voice far sweeter than Willâ€™s. He seemed to be a strolling minstrel,
for he bore a harp in his hand, which he thrummed, while his lusty tenor
voice rang out with--
     â€œHey down, and a down, and a down!
     Iâ€™ve a lassie back iâ€™ the town;
     Come day, come night, Come dark or light,
NA
Robin let the singer pass, caroling on his way.
NA
muttered, a memory of Marian coming back to him. â€œPray heaven she may be
NA
So Robin went back to his camp, where he told of the minstrel.
NA
NA
The very next day his wish was gratified. Little John and Much the
millerâ€™s son were out together on a foraging expedition when they espied
the same young man; at least, they thought it must be he, for he was
clad in scarlet and carried a harp in his hand. But now he came drooping
along the way; his scarlet was all in tatters; and at every step he

Then stepped forth Little John and Much the millerâ€™s son.
NA
NA
No sooner did the young man catch sight of them than he bent his bow,
and held an arrow back to his ear.
NA
NA
NA
So the minstrel put by his bow and suffered himself to be led before
Robin Hood.
NA
not he whom I heard no longer ago than yesternight caroling so blithely

NA

soon to wed her. But she has been taken from me and is to become an
old knightâ€™s bride this very day; and as for me, I care not what ending

â€œLook you, worship, â€˜tis this way. The Normans overrun us, and are in
such great favor that none may say them nay. This old returned Crusader
coveted the land whereon my lady dwells. The estate is not large, but
all in her own right; whereupon her brother says she shall wed a title,
NA
NA
NA
dog not to make fight of this. But the old knight, look you, is not
come-at-able. I threw one of his varlets into a thorn hedge, and another
into a water-butt, and a third landed head-first into a ditch. But I

NA
cross-legged listening to this tale of woe. â€œWhat think you, Friar Tuck,

NA
â€œAt Plympton Church, scarce five miles from here; and at three oâ€™ the
NA

action; and he gave out orders like a general: â€œWill Stutely, do you
have four-and-twenty good men over against Plympton Church â€˜gainst three
oâ€™ the afternoon. Much, good fellow, do you cook up some porridge for
this youth, for he must have a good round stomach--aye, and a better
gear! Will Scarlet, you will see to decking him out bravely for the
nonce. And Friar Tuck, hold yourself in readiness, good book in hand, at

The fat Bishop of Hereford was full of pomp and importance that day at
Plympton Church. He was to celebrate the marriage of an old knight--a
returned Crusader--and a landed young woman; and all the gentry
thereabout were to grace the occasion with their presence. The church
itself was gaily festooned with flowers for the ceremony, while out
in the church-yard at one side brown ale flowed freely for all the
servitors.
Already were the guests beginning to assemble, when the Bishop, back in
the vestry, saw a minstrel clad in green walk up boldly to the door and
peer within. It was Robin Hood, who had borrowed Allanâ€™s be-ribboned
harp for the time.

Then up the lane to the church came the old knight, preceded by ten
archers liveried in scarlet and gold. A brave sight the archers made,
but their master walked slowly leaning upon a cane and shaking as though
in a palsy.
And after them came a sweet lass leaning upon her brotherâ€™s arm. Her
hair did shine like glistering gold, and her eyes were like blue violets
that peep out shyly at the sun. The color came and went in her cheeks
like that tinting of a sea-shell, and her face was flushed as though
she had been weeping. But now she walked with a proud air, as though she
defied the world to crush her spirit. She had but two maids with her,
finikin lasses, with black eyes and broad bosoms, who set off their
ladyâ€™s more delicate beauty well. One held up the brideâ€™s gown from the
ground; the other carried flowers in plenty.
NA
NA
NA
The Bishop had hurriedly donned his gown and now stood ready to meet the
couple at the chancel.
But Robin paid no heed to him. He let the knight and his ten archers
pass by, then he strode up to the bride, and placed himself on the other
side from her brother.
NA
NA
The lady glanced at him with a frightened air, but read such honesty and
kindness in his glance that she brightened and gave him a grateful look.
NA
â€œNay, but I am to bring good fortune to the bride by accompanying her

Thereupon he was allowed to walk by her side unmolested, up to the
chancel with the party.

And he drew forth his bugle from underneath his green cloak and blew
three winding notes that made the church--rafters ring again.
NA
NA
The ten liveried archers rushed forward from the rear of the church,
where they had been stationed. But their rush was blocked by the
onlookers who now rose from their pews in alarm and crowded the aisles.
Meanwhile Robin had leaped lightly over the chancel rail and stationed
himself in a nook by the altar.
NA

NA
Then up rose another great commotion at the door, and four-and-twenty
good bowmen came marching in with Will Stutely at their head. And they
seized the ten liveried archers and the brideâ€™s scowling brother and the
other men on guard and bound them prisoners.
Then in came Allan-a-Dale, decked out gaily, with Will Scarlet for best
man. And they walked gravely down the aisle and stood over against the
chancel.

eyes, and walked over to Allan and clasped her arms about his neck.

Bishopâ€™s frock from his back and put it on the yeoman.
Now the Bishop was short and fat, and Little John was long and lean.
The gown hung loosely over Little Johnâ€™s shoulders and came only to
his waist. He was a fine comical sight, and the people began to laugh
consumedly at him.
NA
NA
So Little John clambered awkwardly into the quire, his short gown
fluttering gaily; and he called the banns for the marriage of the maid
and Allan-a-Dale once, twice, and thrice.
NA
NA
Then Little John asked them in the church four, five, six, and seven
times.

So Friar Tuck, who all along had been back in one corner of the church,
came forward; and Allan and his maid kneeled before him, while the old
knight, held an unwilling witness, gnashed his teeth in impotent rage;
and the friar began with the ceremony.

So the twain were declared man and wife and duly blessed; and the bride
was kissed by each sturdy yeoman beginning with Robin Hood.
Now I cannot end this jolly tale better than in the words of the ballad
which came out of the happening and which has been sung in the villages
and countryside ever since:
     â€œAnd thus having end of this merry wedding,
     The bride lookt like a queen;
     And so they returned to the merry greenwood
NA
CHAPTER IX
HOW THE WIDOWâ€™S THREE SONS WERE RESCUED
     Now Robin Hood is to Nottingham gone,
     With a link a down and a down,
     And there he met with the proud Sheriff,
     Was walking along the town.
The wedding-party was a merry one that left Plympton Church, I ween; but
not so merry were the ones left behind. My lord Bishop of Hereford
was stuck up in the organ-loft and left, gownless and fuming. The ten
liveried archers were variously disposed about the church to keep him
company; two of them being locked in a tiny crypt, three in the belfry,
NA
quire seats or in the vestry. The brideâ€™s brother at her entreaty was
released, but bidden not to return to the church that day or interfere
with his sister again on pain of death. While the rusty old knight was
forced to climb a high tree, where he sat insecurely perched among the
branches, feebly cursing the party as it departed.
It was then approaching sundown, but none of the retainers or villagers
dared rescue the imprisoned ones that night, for fear of Robin Hoodâ€™s
men. So it was not until sunup the next day, that they were released.
The Bishop and the old knight, stiff as they were, did not delay longer
than for breakfast, but so great was their rage and shame--made straight
to Nottingham and levied the Sheriffâ€™s forces. The Sheriff himself was
not anxious to try conclusions again with Robin in the open. Perhaps he
had some slight scruples regarding his oath. But the others swore that
they would go straight to the King, if he did not help them, so he was
fain to consent.
A force of an hundred picked men from the Royal Foresters and swordsmen
of the shire was gathered together and marched straightway into the
greenwood. There, as fortune would have it, they surprised some score of
outlaws hunting, and instantly gave chase. But they could not surround
the outlaws, who kept well in the lead, ever and anon dropping behind
a log or boulder to speed back a shaft which meant mischief to the
pursuers. One shaft indeed carried off the Sheriffâ€™s hat and caused
that worthy man to fall forward upon his horseâ€™s neck from sheer terror;
while five other arrows landed in the fleshy parts of Forestersâ€™ arms.
But the attacking party was not wholly unsuccessful. One outlaw in his
flight stumbled and fell; when two others instantly stopped and helped
to put him on his feet again. They were the widowâ€™s three sons, Stout
Will, and Lester, and John. The pause was an unlucky one for them, as
a party of Sheriffâ€™s men got above them and cut them off from their
fellows. Swordsmen came up in the rear, and they were soon hemmed in on
every side. But they gave good account of themselves, and before they
had been overborne by force of numbers they had killed two and disabled
three more.
The infuriated attackers were almost on the point of hewing the stout
outlaws to pieces, when the Sheriff cried:
â€œHold! Bind the villains! We will follow the law in this and take them
to the town jail. But I promise ye the biggest public hanging that has
NA
So they bound the widowâ€™s three sons and carried them back speedily to
Nottingham.
Now Robin Hood had not chanced to be near the scene of the fight, or
with his men; so for a time he heard nothing of the happening.
But that evening while returning to the camp he was met by the widow
herself, who came weeping along the way.
NA
for he liked her well.
NA
fate that has met my three sons! The Sheriff has laid hands on them and

â€œNow, by our Lady! That cuts me to the heart! Stout Will, and Lester,
and merry John! The earliest friends I had in the band, and still among

would spur me on, even if three of the bravest lads in all the shire
NA
The old widow threw herself on the ground and embraced his knees.
NA
knew your brave true heart would answer me. Heaven help ye, good Master
NA
Then Robin Hood sped straightway to the forest-camp, where he heard the
details of the skirmish--how that his men had been out-numbered five to
one, but got off safely, as they thought, until a count of their members
had shown the loss of the widowâ€™s three sons.
NA
NA
Whereupon the band set to work to devise ways and means.
Robin walked apart a little way with his head leaned thoughtfully upon
his breast--for he was sore troubled--when whom should he meet but an
old begging palmer, one of a devout order which made pilgrimages and
wandered from place to place, supported by charity.
This old fellow walked boldly up to Robin and asked alms of him; since
Robin had been wont to aid members of his order.
NA
NA
NA

Then Robinâ€™s long-sought idea came to him like a flash.

NA
NA

NA
â€œI am in simple earnest, I say. Come, change thine apparel with mine.
Here are twenty pieces of good broad gold to feast they brethren right
NA
So the palmer was persuaded; and Robin put on the old manâ€™s hat, which
stood full high in the crown; and his cloak, patched with black and
blue and red, like Josephâ€™s coat of many colors in its old age; and
his breeches, which had been sewed over with so many patterns that the
original was scarce discernible; and his tattered hose; and his shoes,
cobbled above and below. And while as he made the change in dress he
made so many whimsical comments also about a manâ€™s pride and the dress
that makes a man, that the palmer was like to choke with cackling
laughter.
I warrant you, the two were comical sights when they parted company that
day. Nathless, Robinâ€™s own mother would not have known him, had she been
living.
The next morning the whole town of Nottingham was early astir, and as
soon as the gates were open country-folk began to pour in; for a triple
hanging was not held there every day in the week, and the bustle almost
equated a Fair day.
Robin Hood in his palmerâ€™s disguise was one of the first ones to enter
the gates, and he strolled up and down and around the town as though he
had never been there before in all his life. Presently he came to the
market-place, and beheld thereon three gallows erected.
NA
standing by.
NA
himself, â€˜twould be thrice as high I warrant ye. But Robin is too smart
NA
The palmer crossed himself.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThat hath the Sheriff not decided. But here he comes now to answer his
NA
and his body-guard stalked pompously up to inspect the gallows.
NA
protect you! What will you give a silly old man to-day to be your
NA
NA
â€œNaught save a poor old palmer. But I can shrive their souls and hang
NA
NA
I will add thereunto some suits of clothing for that ragged back of
NA
NA
jail to prepare his three men for execution.
Just before the stroke of noon the doors of the prison opened and the
procession of the condemned came forth. Down through the long lines of
packed people they walked to the market-place, the palmer in the lead,
and the widowâ€™s three sons marching firmly erect between soldiers.
At the gallows foot they halted. The palmer whispered to them, as though
offering last words of consolation; and the three men, with arms bound
tightly behind their backs, ascended the scaffold, followed by their
confessor.
Then Robin stepped to the edge of the scaffold, while the people grew
still as death; for they desired to hear the last words uttered to the
victims. But Robinâ€™s voice did not quaver forth weakly, as formerly,
and his figure had stiffened bolt upright beneath the black robe that
covered his rags.
NA
life, nor do I now intend to begin that trade. Accurst be he who first
set the fashion of hanging! I have but three more words to say. Listen
NA
And forth from the robe he drew his horn and blew three loud blasts
thereon. Then his keen hunting-knife flew forth and in a trice, Stout
Will, Lester, and merry John were free men and had sprung forward and
seized the halberds from the nearest soldiers guarding the gallows.
NA
NA
NA
But their voices were drowned in the uproar that ensued immediately
after Robin blew his horn. He himself had drawn his sword and leaped
down the stairs from the scaffold, followed by his three men. The guard
NA
 shouted Will Stutelyâ€™s clear voice on one side of them, and â€œA
NA
terror-stricken crowd rushed fourscore men in Lincoln green, their force
seeming twice that number in the confusion. With swords drawn they fell
upon the guard from every side at once. There was a brief clash of hot
weapons, then the guard scattered wildly, and Robin Hoodâ€™s men formed in
a compact mass around their leader and forced their way slowly down the
market-place.
NA
NA
In truth, the peril would have been even greater, had this last order
been carried out. But Will Scarlet and Allan-a-Dale had foreseen that
event, and had already overpowered the two warders.
So the gates stood wide open, and toward them the band of outlaws
headed.
The soldiers rallied a force of twice their number and tried resolutely
to pierce their center. But the retreating force turned thrice and sent
such volleys of keen arrows from their good yew bows, that they kept a
distance between the two forces.
And thus the gate was reached, and the long road leading up the hill,
and at last the protecting greenwood itself. The soldiers dared come no
farther. And the widowâ€™s three sons, I warrant you, supped more heartily
that night than ever before in their whole lives.
CHAPTER X
HOW A BEGGAR FILLED THE PUBLIC EYE
     Good Robin accost him in his way,
     To see what he might be;
     If any beggar had money,
     He thought some part had he.
One bright morning, soon after the stirring events told in the last
chapter, Robin wandered forth alone down the road to Barnesdale, to see
if aught had come of the Sheriffâ€™s pursuit. But all was still and
serene and peaceful. No one was in sight save a solitary beggar who came
sturdily along his way in Robinâ€™s direction. The beggar caught sight
of Robin, at the same moment, as he emerged from the trees, but gave no
sign of having seen him. He neither slackened nor quickened his pace,
but jogged forward merrily, whistling as he came, and beating time by
punching holes in the dusty road with the stout pike-staff in his hand.
The curious look of the fellow arrested Robinâ€™s attention, and he
decided to stop and talk with him. The fellow was bare-legged and
bare-armed, and wore a long shift of a shirt, fastened with a belt.
About his neck hung a stout, bulging bag, which was buckled by a good
piece of leather thong.
     He had three hats upon his head,
     Together sticked fast,
     He cared neither for the wind nor wet,
     In lands whereâ€™er he past.
The fellow looked so fat and hearty, and the wallet on his shoulder
seemed so well filled, that Robin thought within himself,
â€œHa! this is a lucky beggar for me! If any of them have money, this is
NA
So he flourished his own stick and planted himself in the travelerâ€™s
path.
NA
NA
The beggar made as though he heard him not, and kept straight on with
his faring.
NA
NA
NA

my way, for â€˜tis growing late, and I have still far to go before I can

NA
â€œI see well by your fat countenance, that you lack not for good food,
while I go hungry. Therefore you must lend me of your means till we meet

NA

Iâ€™ll go mine. If you fast till you get aught out of me, youâ€™ll go hungry
NA
NA
Robin. â€œStand and deliver, I say, or Iâ€™ll dust your shirt for you; and
if that will not teach you manners, then weâ€™ll see what a broad arrow
NA
The beggar smiled, and answered boast with boast. â€œCome on with your
staff, fellow! I care no more for it than for a pudding stick. And as
NA
And with amazing quickness, he swung his pike-staff around and knocked
Robinâ€™s bow clean out of his hand, so that his fingers smarted with
pain. Robin danced and tried to bring his own staff into action; but
the beggar never gave him a chance. Biff! whack! came the pike-staff,
smiting him soundly and beating down his guard.
There were but two things to do; either stand there and take a sound
drubbing, or beat a hasty retreat. Robin chose the latter--as you or I
would probably have done--and scurried back into the wood, blowing his
horn as he went.
NA
haste? We had but just begun. Stay and take your money, else you will
NA
But Robin answered him never a word. He fled up hill and down dale till
he met three of his men who were running up in answer to his summons.
NA
NA

NA
The men--Much and two of the widowâ€™s sons--could scarce conceal their
mirth at the thought of Robin Hood running from a beggar. Nathless, they
kept grave faces, and asked their leader if he was hurt.

So the three yeomen made haste and came out upon the highroad and
followed after the beggar, who was going smoothly along his way again,
as though he were at peace with all the world.

back and wrested his pike-staff from his hand. At the same moment Much
drew his dagger and flashed it before the fellowâ€™s breast.
NA
NA
NA
NA
But they would not listen to him. Instead, they turned him about and
began to march him toward the forest. Seeing that it was useless to
struggle, the beggar began to parley.
NA
safe and quietly, if ye insist, but if ye will set me free Iâ€™ll make
it worth your while. Iâ€™ve a hundred pounds in my bag here. Let me go my

The three outlaws took council together at this.
NA
NA
The other two agreed, and the little party came to a halt and loosed
hold of the beggar.
NA
wind blowing, and the beggar turned about to face it, directly they had
unhanded him.
NA
NA
The cloak was handed him, and he placed his wallet upon it as though
it were very heavy indeed. Then he crouched down and fumbled with
the leather fastenings. The outlaws also bent over and watched the
proceeding closely, lest he should hide some of the money on his person.
Presently he got the bag unfastened and plunged his hands into it. Forth
from it he drew--not shining gold--but handfuls of fine meal which he
dashed into the eager faces of the men around him. The wind aided him
in this, and soon there arose a blinding cloud which filled the eyes,
noses, and mouths of the three outlaws till they could scarcely see or
breathe.
While they gasped and choked and sputtered and felt around wildly for
that rogue of a beggar, he finished the job by picking up the cloak
by its corners and shaking it vigorously in the faces of his suffering
victims. Then he seized a stick which lay conveniently near, and began
to rain blows down upon their heads, shoulders, and sides, all the time
dancing first on one leg, then on the other, and crying,
â€œVillains! rascals! here are the hundred pounds I promised. How do you
NA
Whack! whack! whack! whack! went the stick, emphasizing each word. Howls
of pain might have gone up from the sufferers, but they had too much
meal in their throats for that. Their one thought was to flee, and they
stumbled off blindly down the road, the beggar following them a little
way to give them a few parting love-taps.
NA
when next I come along the Barnesdale road, I hope you will be able to

With this he departed, an easy victor, and again went whistling on his
way, while the three outlaws rubbed the meal out of their eyes and began
to catch their breath again.
As soon as they could look around them clearly, they beheld Robin
Hood leaning against a tree trunk and surveying them smilingly. He had
recovered his own spirits in full measure, on seeing their plight.
NA
NA
Then when they looked shamefaced and answered never a word, he went on,
in a soft voice,
NA
NA

meal for a week. I was born in a mill, and had the smell of meal in my
nostrils from my very birth, you might say, and yet never before did I

And he sneezed violently.
NA
â€œWhy we laid hold of the beggar, as you did order, when he offered to

opened his bag and shook it thereon. Instantly a great cloud of meal
filled the air, whereby we could neither see nor breathe; and in the
NA
â€œBut not before he left certain black and blue spots, to be remembered
NA
NA
rubbing himself ruefully.
Then Robin laughed outright, and sat him down upon the gnarled root of a
tree, to finish his merriment.
NA
laugh at ye, my men, for I am in the same boat with ye. But â€˜twould
never do to have this tale get abroad--even in the greenwood--how that
we could not hold our own with the odds in our favor. So let us have
NA
The others saw the point of this, and felt better directly, despite
their itching desire to get hold of the beggar again. And none of the
four ever told of the adventure.
But the beggar must have boasted of it at the next tavern; or a little
bird perched among the branches of a neighboring oak must have sung
of it. For it got abroad, as such tales will, and was put into a right
droll ballad which, I warrant you, the four outlaws did not like to
hear.
CHAPTER XI
HOW ROBIN HOOD FOUGHT GUY OF GISBORNE
NA
     â€œAnd Robin to take Iâ€™m sworn;
     And when I am called by my right name,
NA
Some weeks passed after the rescue of the widowâ€™s three sons; weeks
spent by the Sheriff in the vain effort to entrap Robin Hood and his
men. For Robinâ€™s name and deeds had come to the Kingâ€™s ears, in London
town, and he sent word to the Sheriff to capture the outlaw, under
penalty of losing his office. So the Sheriff tried every manner of means
to surprise Robin Hood in the forest, but always without success. And he
increased the price put upon Robinâ€™s head, in the hope that the best men
of the kingdom could be induced to try their skill at a capture.
Now there was a certain Guy of Gisborne, a hireling knight of the Kingâ€™s
army, who heard of Robin and of the price upon his head. Sir Guy was one
of the best men at the bow and the sword in all the Kingâ€™s service.
But his heart was black and treacherous. He obtained the Kingâ€™s leave
forthwith to seek out the forester; and armed with the Kingâ€™s scroll he
came before the Sheriff at Nottingham.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
never come at the bold robber. I must needs go alone. But do you hold
your men in readiness at Barnesdale, and when you hear a blast from this
silver bugle, come quickly, for I shall have the sly Robin within my
NA
NA
about giving orders, while Guy of Gisborne sallied forth disguised.
Now as luck would have it, Will Scarlet and Little John had gone to
Barnesdale that very day to buy suits of Lincoln green for certain of
the yeomen who had come out at the knees and elbows. But not deeming it
best for both of them to run their necks into a noose, together, they
parted just outside the town, and Will went within the gates, while John
tarried and watched at the brow of the hill on the outside.
Presently whom should he see but this same Will flying madly forth from
the gates again, closely pursued by the Sheriff and threescore men. Over
the moat Will sprang, through the bushes and briars, across the swamp,
over stocks and stones, up the woodland roads in long leaps like a
scared jack rabbit. And after him puffed the Sheriff and his men, their
force scattering out in the flight as one man would tumble head-first
into a ditch, another mire up in the swamp, another trip over a rolling
stone, and still others sit down on the roadside and gasp for wind like
fish out of water.
Little John could not forbear laughing heartily at the scene, though
he knew that â€˜twould be anything but a laughing matter if Will should
stumble. And in truth one man was like to come upon him. It was
William-a-Trent, the best runner among the Sheriffâ€™s men. He had come
within twenty feet of Scarlet and was leaping upon him with long bounds
like a greyhound, when John rose up quickly, drew his bow and let fly
one of his fatal shafts. It would have been better for William-a-Trent
to have been abed with sorrow--says the ballad--than to be that day in
the greenwood slade to meet with Little Johnâ€™s arrow. He had run his
last race.
The others halted a moment in consternation, when the shaft came
hurtling down from the hill; but looking up they beheld none save Little
John, and with a cry of fierce joy they turned upon him. Meanwhile Will
Scarlet had reached the brow of the hill and sped down the other side.
NA
NA
But this foolhardy deed was his undoing, for just as the arrow left the
string, the good yew bow that had never before failed him snapped in
twain.
â€œWoe worth, woe worth thee, wicked wood, that ere thou grew on a
NA
resolved to sell the path dearly; for the soldiers were now so close
upon him that he dared not turn.
And a right good account of himself he gave that day, dealing with
each man as he came up according to his merit. And so winded were the
pursuers when they reached the top of the hill that he laid out the
first ten of them right and left with huge blows of his brawny fist.
But if five men can do more than three, a score can overcome one.
A body of archers stood off at a prudent distance and covered Little
John with their arrows.
NA
Greenleaf, or whatever else name you carry this day! Yield you, or some
NA
NA
NA
So the Sheriffâ€™s men laid hold of Little John and bound him fast with
many cords, so fearful were they lest he should escape. And the Sheriff
laughed aloud in glee, and thought of how he should avenge his stolen
plate, and determined to make a good dayâ€™s work of it.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Back down the hill and across the moor went the company speedily, for
they feared a rescue. And as they went the stragglers joined them. Here
a man got up feebly out of the ditch and rubbed his pate and fell in
like a chicken with the pip going for its dinner. Yonder came hobbling
a man with a lame ankle, or another with his shins torn by the briars or
another with his jacket all muddy from the marsh. So in truth it was
a tatterdemalion crew that limped and straggled and wandered back into
Barnesdale that day. Yet all were merry, for the Sheriff had promised
them flagons of wine, and moreover they were to hang speedily the
boldest outlaw in England, next to Robin Hood himself.
The gallows was quickly put up and a new rope provided.
NA
NA
NA
NA
In good sooth the time was dire and pressing. The rope was placed around
the prisonerâ€™s neck and the men prepared to haul away.
NA
NA
came floating over the hill.
NA
â€œand he bade me not to delay answering its summons. He has caught Robin
NA
NA
Hood, this is a merry day indeed. And let us save this fellow and build
NA
NA
NA
So Little John was made fast to the gallows-tree, while the Sheriff and
all his men who could march or hobble went out to get Robin Hood and
bring him in for the double hanging.
Let us leave talking of Little John and the Sheriff, and see what has
become of Robin Hood.
In the first place, he and Little John had come near having a quarrel
that self-same morning because both had seen a curious looking yeoman,
and each wanted to challenge him singly. But Robin would not give way to
his lieutenant, and that is why John, in a huff, had gone with Will to
Barnesdale.
Meanwhile Robin approached the curious looking stranger. He seemed to be
a three-legged creature at first sight, but on coming nearer you would
have seen that â€˜twas really naught but a poorly clad man, who for a
freak had covered up his rags with a capul-hide, nothing more nor less
than the sun-dried skin of a horse, complete with head, tail, and mane.
The skin of the head made a helmet; while the tail gave the curious
three-legged appearance.
NA
NA
NA
of archery that I am thinking this morning, for I have lost my way and
NA
NA
NA
he, â€œan you will tell me your business. For belike your speech is much
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
ye, since you are a Ranger, I must eâ€™en demand your service. I am on the
Kingâ€™s business and seek an outlaw. Men call him Robin Hood. Are you one
NA
NA
â€œThat is another tale. But Iâ€™d rather meet with that proud outlaw than
NA
Robin now saw how the land lay.
NA
day, I can show you Robinâ€™s haunts when he is at home. Meanwhile let us
have some pastime under the greenwood tree. Let us first try the mastery
NA
The other agreed, and they cut down two willow wands of a summerâ€™s
growth that grew beneath a brier, and set them up at a distance of
threescore yards.
NA
NA
So Robin stepped forth and bent his bow carelessly and sent his
shaft whizzing toward the wand, missing it by a scant inch. He of the
horse-hide followed with more care yet was a good three-fingersâ€™ breadth
away. On the second round, the stranger led off and landed cleverly
within the small garland at the top of the wand; but Robin shot far
better and clave the wand itself, clean at the middle.
NA
shooting as that! Belike you are better than Robin Hood himself. But you

NA
NA
NA
down, and to take bold Robin am I sworn. This would I tell him to his
face, were he not so great a craven. When I am called by my right name,
NA
This he said with a great show of pride, and he strutted back and forth,
forgetful that he had just been beaten at archery.
Robin eyed him quietly. â€œMethinks I have heard of you elsewhere. Do you

my grasp. And if you show him to me, Iâ€™ll give you the half of my forty

NA
NA
sword leaped forth from beneath the horseâ€™s hide with the speed born of
long practice, and before Robin had come to guard, the other had smitten
at him full and foul. Robin eluded the lunge and drew his own weapon.
NA
Then neither spoke more, but fell sternly to work--lunge and thrust and
ward and parry--for two full hours the weapons smote together sullenly,
and neither Robin Hood nor Sir Guy would yield an inch. I promise you
that if you could have looked forth on the fight from behind the trunk
of some friendly tree, you would have seen deadly sport such as few
men beheld in Sherwood Forest. For the fighters glared sullenly at each
other, the fires of hatred burning in their eyes. One was fighting for
his life; the other for a reward and the Kingâ€™s favor.
Still circled the bright blades swiftly in the air--now gleaming in the
peaceful sunlight--again hissing like maddened serpents. Neither had yet
touched the other, until Robin, in an unlucky moment, stumbled over
the projecting root of a tree; when Sir Guy, instead of giving him the
chance to recover himself, as any courteous knight would have done,
struck quickly at the falling man and wounded him in the left side.
NA
NA
And adroitly he sprang up again, and came straight at the other with an
awkward but unexpected stroke. The knight had raised his weapon high to
give a final blow, when Robin reached beneath and across his guard.
One swift lunge, and Sir Guy of Gisborne staggered backward with a deep
groan, Robinâ€™s sword through his throat.
Robin looked at the slain man regretfully.
NA
NA
He looked to his own wound. It was not serious, and he soon staunched
the blood and bound up the cut. Then he dragged the dead body into the
bushes, and took off the horseâ€™s hide and put it upon himself. He placed
his own cloak upon Sir Guy, and marked his face so none might tell who
had been slain. Robinâ€™s own figure and face were not unlike the otherâ€™s.
Pulling the capul-hide well over himself, so that the helmet hid most
of his face, Robin seized the silver bugle and blew a long blast. It was
the blast that saved the life of Little John, over in Barnesdale, for
you and I have already seen how it caused the fond Sheriff to prick up
his ears and stay the hanging, and go scurrying up over the hill and
into the wood with his men in search of another victim.
In five-and-twenty minutes up came running a score of the Sheriffâ€™s best
archers.
NA
NA
NA
â€œRobin Hood and Guy of Gisborne had a fight; and he that wears Robinâ€™s

NA

NA
â€œYes. This is our lucky day on the calendar. After you left me we
narrowly missed running one of the fellows--I believe â€˜twas Will
Scarlet--to earth; and another who came to his relief we were just about
NA
NA
NA
NA
 For the Sheriff could not forget the name Little John had borne under
his own roof at Nottingham.
NA
NA
 continued the Sheriff, becoming talkative through pure glee. â€œHere, one
of you men! Give Sir Guy of Gisborne your horse; while others of you
bury that dog of an outlaw where he lies. And let us hasten back to

So they put spurs to their horses, and as they rode Robin forced himself
to talk merrily, while all the time he was planning the best way to
succor Little John.
NA
NA
â€œI do not want any of your gold, for I have had a brave fight. But now
that I have slain the master, let me put an end to the man; so it shall
be said that Guy of Gisborne despatched the two greatest outlaws of

Then he approached Little John, who was still tied to the gallows-tree;

he had been careful to take.

already, and had decided there was to be no hanging that day.
Then Robin blew three loud blasts upon his own horn, and drew forth his
own bow; and before the astonished Sheriff and his men could come to
arms the arrows were whistling in their midst in no uncertain fashion.
And look! Through the gates and over the walls came pouring another
flight of arrows! Will Scarlet and Will Stutely had watched and planned
a rescue ever since the Sheriff and Robin rode back down the hill. Now
in good time they came; and the Sheriffâ€™s demoralized force turned tail
and ran, while Robin and Little John stood under the harmless gallows,
and sped swift arrows after them, and laughed to see them go.
Then they joined their comrades and hasted back to the good greenwood,
and there rested. They had got enough sport for one day.
CHAPTER XII
HOW MAID MARIAN CAME BACK TO SHERWOOD FOREST; ALSO, HOW ROBIN HOOD CAME
BEFORE QUEEN ELEANOR.
     But Robin Hood, he himself had disguisâ€™d,
     And Marian was strangely attirâ€™d,
     That they proved foes, and so fell to blows,
     Whose valor bold Robin admirâ€™d.
     And when he came at Londonâ€™s court,
     He fell down on his knee.
NA
NA
Now it fell out that one day not long thereafter, Robin was minded to
try his skill at hunting. And not knowing whom he might meet in his
rambles, he stained his face and put on a sorry-looking jacket and a
long cloak before he sallied forth. As he walked, the peacefulness of
the morning came upon him, and brought back to his memory the early days
so long ago when he had roamed these same glades with Marian. How sweet
they seemed to him now, and how far away! Marian, too, the dainty friend
of his youth--would he ever see her again? He had thought of her very
often of late, and each time with increasing desire to hear her clear
voice and musical laugh, and see her eyes light up at his coming.
Perhaps the happiness of Allen-a-Dale and his lady had caused Robinâ€™s
heart-strings to vibrate more strongly; perhaps, too, the coming of
Will Scarlet. But, certes, Robin was anything but a hunter this bright
morning as he walked along with head drooping in a most love-lorn way.
Presently a hart entered the glade in full view of him, grazing
peacefully, and instantly the man of action awoke. His bow was drawn
and a shaft all but loosed, when the beast fell suddenly, pierced by a
clever arrow from the far side of the glade.
Then a handsome little page sprang gleefully from the covert and ran
toward the dying animal. This was plainly the archer, for he flourished
his bow aloft, and likewise bore a sword at his side, though for all
that he looked a mere lad.
Robin approached the hart from the other side.
NA
NA
NA
The voice stirred Robin strongly. It seemed to chime into his memories
of the old days. He looked at the page sharply, and the other returned
the glance, straight and unafraid.
NA
NA
â€œSoftly! Fair and softly, sweet page, or we of the forest will have to
NA
NA
NA
He swung his blade valiantly; and Robin saw nothing for it but to draw
likewise. The page thereupon engaged him quite fiercely, and Robin found
that he had many pretty little tricks at fencing.
Nathless, Robin contented himself with parrying, and was loth to exert
all his superior strength upon the lad. So the fight lasted for above a
quarter of an hour, at the end of which time the page was almost spent
and the hot blood flushed his cheeks in a most charming manner.
The outlaw saw his distress, and to end the fight allowed himself to be
pricked slightly on the wrist.
NA
of the blood.
NA
NA
NA
the lad with dignity; and again the sound of his voice troubled Robin
sorely.
NA
The lad considered his answer while wiping his sword with a small lace
kerchief. The action brought a dim confused memory to Robin. The lad
finally looked him again in the eye.
â€œForester, whether or no you be a Kingâ€™s man, know that I seek one Robin
Hood, an outlaw, to whom I bring amnesty from the Queen. Can you tell me
NA
in his shirt. As he did so, the gleam of a golden trophy caught the
outlawâ€™s eye.
Robin started forward with a joyful cry.
â€œAh! I know you now! By the sight of yon golden arrow won at the
Sheriffâ€™s tourney, you are she on whom I bestowed it, and none other
NA
NA
NA
and stained of face, he clasped the dainty page close to his breast, and
she forsooth yielded right willingly.
NA
NA
NA
But she made more ado over the sore wrist than Robin had received for
all his former hurts put together. And she bound it with the little
NA
spoke the truth, for he never felt better in all his life. The whole
woods seemed tinged with a roseate hue, since Marian had come again.
But she, while happy also, was ill at ease; and Robin with a manâ€™s slow
discernment at last saw that it was because of her boyâ€™s attire. He
thought bluntly that there was naught to be ashamed of, yet smilingly
handed her his tattered long cloak, which she blushingly put on, and
forthwith recovered her spirits directly.
Then they began to talk of each otherâ€™s varied fortunes, and of the many
things which had parted them; and so much did they find to tell that the
sun had begun to decline well into the afternoon before they realized
how the hours sped.
NA
NA
NA
that I was Richard Partington, and really did bring you a message from
NA
â€œTell me on our way home, and there you shall be entrusted to Mistress
NA
So she told him, as they walked back through the glade, how that the
fame of his prowess had reached Queen Eleanorâ€™s ears, in London town.
And the Queen had said, â€œFain would I see this bold yeoman, and behold
NA
he and four of his archers would repair to London against the next
tournament the week following, there to shoot against King Henryâ€™s
picked men, of whom the King was right vain. All this Marian told in
detail, and added:
â€œWhen I heard Her Majesty say she desired to see you, I asked leave
to go in search of you, saying I had known you once. And the Queen was
right glad, and bade me go, and sent this gold ring to you from off her
NA
Then Robin took the ring and bowed his head and kissed it loyally. â€œBy
NA
the Queenâ€™s pledge, may the hand that bears it be stricken off at the
NA
and Robin presented Maid Marian to the band, who treated her with the
greatest respect. Will Scarlet was especially delighted to greet again
his old time friend, while Allan-a-Dale and his good wife bustled about
to make her welcome in their tiny thatched cottage.
That evening after they had supped royally upon the very hart that
Marian had slain, Allan sang sweet songs of Northern minstrelsy to the
fair guest as she sat by Robinâ€™s side, the golden arrow gleaming in
her dark hair. The others all joined in the chorus, from Will Scarletâ€™s
baritone to Friar Tuckâ€™s heavy bass. Even Little John essayed to sing,
although looked at threateningly by Much the millerâ€™s son.
Then Robin bade Marian repeat her message from the Queen, which Marian
did in a way befitting the dignity of her royal mistress. After which
the yeomen gave three cheers for the Queen and three more for her page,
and drank toasts to them both, rising to their feet.
NA
God preserve!--wishes but four men to go with me. Wherefore, I choose
Little John and Will Stutely, my two lieutenants, Will Scarlet, my
cousin, and Allan-a-Dale, my minstrel. Mistress Dale, also, can go with
her husband and be company for the Queenâ€™s page. We will depart with
early morning, decked in our finest. So stir ye, my lads! and see that
not only your tunics are fresh, but your swords bright and your bows
and arrows fit. For we must be a credit to the Queen as well as the good
greenwood. You, Much, with Stout Will, Lester, and John, the widowâ€™s
three sons, shall have command of the band while we are away; and Friar
NA
The orders were received with shouts of approval, and toasts all around
were drunk again in nut-brown ale, ere the company dispersed to rest
after making ready for the journey.
The next morning was as fine a summerâ€™s day as ever you want to see, and
the green leaves of the forest made a pleasing background for the gay
picture of the yeomen setting forth. Says the old ballad--it was a
seemly sight to see how Robin Hood himself had dressed, and all his
yeomanry. He clothed his men in Lincoln green, and himself in scarlet
red, with hats of black and feathers white to bravely deck each head.
Nor were the two ladies behind-hand, I ween, at the bedecking.
Thus the chosen party of seven sallied forth being accompanied to the
edge of the wood by the whole band, who gave them a merry parting and
Godspeed!
The journey to London town was made without incident. The party
proceeded boldly along the Kingâ€™s highroad, and no man met them who was
disposed to say them nay. Besides, the good Queenâ€™s warrant and ring
would have answered for them, as indeed it did at the gates of London.
So on they sped and in due course came to the palace itself and awaited
audience with the Queen.
Now the King had gone that day to Finsbury Field, where the tourney was
soon to be held, in order to look over the lists and see some of his
picked men whom he expected to win against all comers. So much had he
boasted of these men, that the Queen had secretly resolved to win a
wager of him. She had heard of the fame of Robin Hood and his yeomen, as
Marian had said; and Marian on her part had been overjoyed to be able to
add a word in their favor and to set out in search of them.
To-day the Queen sat in her private audience-room chatting pleasantly
with her ladies, when in came Mistress Marian Fitzwalter attired again
as befitted her rank of lady-in-waiting. She courtesied low to the Queen
and awaited permission to speak.
NA
NA
â€œBoth, an it please Your Majesty. Richard found the man you sought,
NA
NA
â€œAwaiting your audience--he and four of his men, likewise a lady of
NA
NA
So Marian gave orders to a herald, and presently Robin Hood and his
little party entered the room.
Now the Queen had half-expected the men to be rude and uncouth in
appearance, because of their wild life in the forest; but she was
delightfully disappointed. Indeed she started back in surprise and
almost clapped her hands. For, sooth to say, the yeomen made a brave
sight, and in all the court no more gallant men could be found. Marian
felt her cheeks glow with pride, at sight of the half-hidden looks of
admiration sent forth by the other ladies-in-waiting.
Robin had not forgot the gentle arts taught by his mother, and he wore
his fine red velvet tunic and breeches with the grace of a courtier.
We have seen, before, what a dandified gentleman Will Scarlet was; and
Allan-a-Dale, the minstrel, was scarcely less goodly to look upon.
While the giant Little John and broad-shouldered Will Stutely made up in
stature what little they lacked in outward polish. Mistress Dale, on her
part, looked even more charming, if possible, than on the momentous day
when she went to Plympton Church to marry one man and found another.
Thus came the people of the greenwood before Queen Eleanor, in her own
private audience room. And Robin advanced and knelt down before her, and
said:
â€œHere I am, Robin Hood--I and my chosen men! At Your Majestyâ€™s bidding
am I come, bearing the ring of amnesty which I will protect--as I would
NA
NA
NA
Then Robin presented each of his men in turn, and each fell on his
knee and was greeted with most kindly words. And the Queen kissed fair
Mistress Dale upon the cheek, and bade her remain in the palace with her
ladies while she was in the city. And she made all the party be seated
to rest themselves after their long journey. Fine wines were brought,
and cake, and rich food, for their refreshment. And as they ate and
drank, the Queen told them further of the tourney to be held at Finsbury
Field, and of how she desired them to wear her colors and shoot for her.
Meantime, she concluded, they were to lie by quietly and be known of no
man.
To do all this, Robin and his men pledged themselves full heartily. Then
at the Queenâ€™s request, they related to her and her ladies some of their
merry adventures; whereat the listeners were vastly entertained, and
laughed heartily. Then Marian, who had heard of the wedding at Plympton
Church, told it so drolly that tears stood in the Queenâ€™s eyes from
merriment.
NA
for him! I shall keep that to twit his bones, I promise you! So this is
NA
NA
Allan bowed low, and took a harp which was brought to him, and he
thrummed the strings and sang full sweetly the border songs of the North
Countree. And the Queen and all her ladies listened in rapt silence till
all the songs were ended.
CHAPTER XIII
HOW THE OUTLAWS SHOT IN KING HARRYâ€™S TOURNEY
     The King is into Finsbury Field
     Marching in battle â€˜ray,
     And after follows bold Robin Hood,
     And all his yeomen gay.
The morning of the great archery contest dawned fair and bright,
bringing with it a fever of impatience to every citizen of London town,
from the proudest courtier to the lowest kitchen wench. Aye, and all the
surrounding country was early awake, too, and began to wend their way to
Finsbury Field, a fine broad stretch of practice ground near Moorfields.
Around three sides of the Field were erected tier upon tier of seats,
for the spectators, with the royal boxes and booths for the nobility
and gentry in the center. Down along one end were pitched gaily colored
tents for the different bands of Kingâ€™s archers. There were ten of
these bands, each containing a score of men headed by a captain of great
renown; so to-day there were ten of the pavilions, each bearing aloft
the Royal Arms and vari-colored pennants which fluttered lightly in the
fresh morning breeze.
Each captainâ€™s flag was of peculiar color and device. First came the
royal purple streamer of Tepus, own bow-bearer to the King, and esteemed
the finest archer in all the land. Then came the yellow of Clifton of
Buckinghamshire; and the blue of Gilbert of the White Hand--he who was
renowned in Nottinghamshire; and the green of Elwyn the Welshman; and
the White of Robert of Cloudesdale; and, after them, five other captains
of bands, each a man of proved prowess. As the Queen had said aforetime,
the King was mightily proud of his archers, and now held this tourney to
show their skill and, mayhap, to recruit their forces.
The uprising tiers of seats filled early, upon this summer morning, and
the merry chatter of the people went abroad like the hum of bees in a
hive. The royal party had not yet put in an appearance, nor were any
of the Kingâ€™s archers visible. So the crowd was content to hide its
impatience by laughing jibes passed from one section to another, and
crying the colors of their favorite archers. In and out among the seats
went hawkers, their arms laden with small pennants to correspond with
the rival tents. Other vendors of pie and small cakes and cider also did
a thrifty business, for so eager had some of the people been to get good
seats, that they had rushed away from home without their breakfast.
Suddenly the gates at the far end, next the tents, opened wide, and a
courier in scarlet and gold, mounted upon a white horse, rode in
blowing lustily upon the trumpet at his lips; and behind him came six
standard-bearers riding abreast. The populace arose with a mighty cheer.
King Harry had entered the arena. He bestrode a fine white charger
and was clad in a rich dark suit of slashed velvet with satin and gold
facings. His hat bore a long curling ostrich plume of pure white and he
doffed it graciously in answer to the shouts of the people. By his
side rode Queen Eleanor, looking regal and charming in her long brocade
riding-habit; while immediately behind them came Prince Richard and
Prince John, each attired in knightly coats of mail and helmets. Lords
and ladies of the realm followed; and finally, the ten companies of
archers, whose progress round the field was greeted with hardly less
applause than that given the King himself.
The King and Queen dismounted from their steeds, ascended the steps
of the royal box, and seated themselves upon two thrones, decked with
purple and gold trapping, upon a dais sheltered by striped canvas. In
the booths at each side the members of the Court took their places;
while comely pages ran hither and thither bearing the royal commands.
â€˜Twas a lordly sight, I ween, this shifting of proud courtiers, flashing
of jeweled fans, and commingling of bright colors with costly gems!
Now the herald arose to command peace, and soon the clear note of his
bugle rose above the roar of the crowd and hushed it to silence. The
tenscore archers ranged themselves in two long rows on each side of
the lists--a gallant array--while their captains, as a special mark of
favor, stood near the royal box.

second, a purse containing twoscore silver pennies; and for third a

these prizes, the winning companies shall have, first, two tuns of
Rhenish wine; second, two tuns of English beer; and, third, five of
the fattest harts that run on Dallom Lea. Methinks that is a princely

Up spake bold Clifton, secure in the Kingâ€™s favor. â€œMeasure no marks for
NA
NA
NA
NA
Forthwith, Tepus bowed low, and set up ten targets, each bearing the
pennant of a different company, while the herald stood forth again and
proclaimed the rules and prizes. The entries were open to all comers.
Each man, also, of the Kingâ€™s archers should shoot three arrows at the
target bearing the colors of his band, until the best bowman in each
band should be chosen. These ten chosen archers should then enter a
contest for an open target--three shots apiece--and here any other
bowman whatsoever was asked to try his skill. The result at the open
targets should decide the tourney.
Then all the people shouted again, in token that the terms of the
contest pleased them; and the archers waved their bows aloft, and
wheeled into position facing their respective targets.
The shooting now began, upon all the targets at once, and the multitude
had so much ado to watch them, that they forgot to shout. Besides,
silence was commanded during the shooting. Of all the fine shooting that
morning, I have not now space to tell you. The full score of men shot
three times at each target, and then three times again to decide a tie.
For, more than once, the arrow shot by one man would be split wide
open by his successor. Every manâ€™s shaft bore his number to ease the
counting; and so close would they stick at the end of a round, that the
target looked like a big bristle hairbrush. Then must the spectators
relieve their tense spirits by great cheering; while the King looked
mighty proud of his skilled bowmen.
At last the company targets were decided, and Tepus, as was expected,
led the score, having made six exact centers in succession. Gilbert
of the White Hand followed with five, and Clifton with four. Two other
captains had touched their center four times, but not roundly. While in
the other companies it so chanced that the captains had been out-shot by
some of the men under them.
The winners then saluted the King and Queen, and withdrew for a space to
rest and renew their bow-strings for the keenest contest of all; while
the lists were cleared and a new target--the open one--was set up at
twelvescore paces. At the bidding of the King, the herald announced
that the open target was to be shot at, to decide the title of the best
archer in all England; and any man there present was privileged to try
for it. But so keen had been the previous shooting, that many yeomen who
had come to enter the lists now would not do so; and only a dozen men
stepped forth to give in their names.
NA
NA
â€œThink you that your ten chosen fellows are the best bowmen in all
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œIf I produce five archers who can out-shoot your ten, will you grant my

NA
step forward, from a near-by booth where she sat with other
ladies-in-waiting, and whispered something in her ear. Marian courtesied
and withdrew.
Now the ten chosen archers from the Kingâ€™s bands came forth again and
took their stand; and with them stood forth the twelve untried men from
the open lists. Again the crowd was stilled, and every eye hung upon the
speeding of the shafts. Slowly but skilfully each man shot, and as
his shaft struck within the inner ring a deep breath broke from the
multitude like the sound of the wind upon the seashore. And now Gilbert
of the White Hand led the shooting, and â€˜twas only by the space of a
hairsbreadth upon the line that Tepus tied his score. Stout Elwyn, the
Welshman, took third place; one of the private archers, named Geoffrey,
come fourth; while Clifton must needs content himself with fifth.
The men from the open lists shot fairly true, but nervousness and fear
of ridicule wrought their undoing.
The herald then came forward again, and, instead of announcing the
prize-winners, proclaimed that there was to be a final contest. Two
men had tied for first place, declared His Majesty the King, and three
others were entitled to honors. Now all these five were to shoot
again, and they were to be pitted against five other of the Queenâ€™s
choosing--men who had not yet shot upon that day.
A thrill of astonishment and excitement swept around the arena. â€œWho
NA
of eager voices grew intense; and in the midst of it all, the gate at
the far end of the field opened and five men entered and escorted a lady
upon horseback across the arena to the royal box. The lady was instantly
recognized as Mistress Marian of the Queenâ€™s household, but no one
seemed to know the faces of her escort. Four were clad in Lincoln green,
while the fifth, who seemed to be the leader, was dressed in a brave
suit of scarlet red. Each man wore a close fitting cap of black, decked
with a curling white feather. For arms, they carried simply a stout bow,
a sheaf of new arrows, and a short hunting-knife.
When the little party came before the dais on which the King and Queen
sat, the yeomen doffed their caps humbly, while Maid Marian was assisted
to dismount.

Then turning to his five victorious archers, who had drawn near, he
added, â€œYe have heard, my men, how that I have a wager with the Queen
upon your prowess. Now here be men of her choosing--certain free shafts
of Sherwood and Barnesdale. Wherefore look well to it, Gilbert and Tepus
and Geoffrey and Elwyn and Clifton! If ye outshoot these knaves, I will
fill your caps with silver pennies--aye, and knight the man who stands
first. But if ye lose, I give the prizes, for which ye have just
NA
NA
of wild-fire, and every neck craned forward to see the famous fellows
who had dared to brave the Kingâ€™s anger, because of the Queen.
Another target was now set up, at the same distance as the last, and
it was decided that the ten archers should shoot three arrows in turn.
Gilbert and Robin tossed up a penny for the lead, and it fell to the
Kingâ€™s men. So Clifton was bidden to shoot first.
Forth he stood, planting his feet firmly, and wetting his fingers before
plucking the string. For he was resolved to better his losing score of
that day. And in truth he did so, for the shaft he loosed sped true, and
landed on the black bullâ€™s-eye, though not in the exact center. Again he
shot, and again he hit the black, on the opposite rim. The third shaft
swerved downward and came within the second ring, some two fingersâ€™
breadths away. Nathless, a general cry went up, as this was the best
shooting Clifton had done that day.
Will Scarlet was chosen to follow him, and now took his place and
carefully chose three round and full-feathered arrows.
NA
NA
But Robin gave Will the wrong caution, for over-much care spoiled
his aim. His first shaft flew wide and lodged in the second ring even
further away than the worst shot of Clifton.
NA
NA
And Will profited by this hint, and loosed his next two shafts as
freely as though they flew along a Sherwood glade. Each struck upon the
bullâ€™s-eye, and one even nearer the center than his rivalâ€™s mark. Yet
the total score was adjudged in favor of Clifton. At this Will Scarlet
bit his lip, but said no word, while the crowd shouted and waved yellow
flags for very joy that the Kingâ€™s man had overcome the outlaw. They
knew, also, that this demonstration would please the King.
The target was now cleared for the next two contestants--Geoffrey and
Allan-a-Dale. Whereat, it was noticed that many ladies in the Queenâ€™s
booths boldly flaunted Allanâ€™s colors, much to the honest pride which
glowed in the cheeks of one who sat in their midst.
NA
husband can handle the longbow as skilfully as the harp, his rival has
NA
The saying augured well. Geoffrey had shot many good shafts that day;
and indeed had risen from the ranks by virtue of them. But now each of
his three shots, though well placed in triangular fashion around the rim
of the bullâ€™s-eye, yet allowed an easy space for Allan to graze within.
His shooting, moreover, was so prettily done, that he was right heartily
applauded--the ladies and their gallants leading in the hand-clapping.
Now you must know that there had long been a friendly rivalry in Robin
Hoodâ€™s band as to who was the best shot, next after Robin himself. He
and Will Stutely had lately decided their marksmanship, and Will had
found that Robinâ€™s skill was now so great as to place the leader at the
head of all good bowmen in the forest. But the second place lay between
Little John and Stutely, and neither wished to yield to the other. So
to-day they looked narrowly at their leader to see who should shoot
third. Robin read their faces at a glance, and laughing merrily, broke
off two straws and held them out.
NA
Elwyn the Welshman was to precede him; and his score was no whit better
than Geoffreyâ€™s. But Stutely failed to profit by it. His besetting sin
at archery had ever been an undue haste and carelessness. To-day these
were increased by a certain moodiness, that Little John had outranked
him. So his first two shafts flew swiftly, one after the other, to
lodging places outside the Welshmanâ€™s mark.
NA
NA
NA
spoke his last shaft. It whistled down the course unerringly and struck
in the exact center--the best shot yet made.
Now some shouted for Stutely and some shouted for Elwyn; but Elwynâ€™s
total mark was declared the better. Whereupon the King turned to the
NA
three first rounds have gone to my men. Your outlaws will have to shoot
NA
The Queen smiled gently.
NA
NA
NA
So each turned again to the lists and awaited the next rounds in silent
eagerness. I ween that King Harry had never watched the invasion of an
enemy with more anxiety than he now felt.
Tepus was chosen to go next and he fell into the same error with Will
Scarlet. He held the string a moment too long, and both his first and
second arrows came to grief. One of them, however, came within the black
rim, and he followed it up by placing his third in the full center,
just as Stutely had done in his last. These two centers were the fairest
shots that had been made that day; and loud was the applause which
greeted this second one. But the shouting was as nothing to the uproar
which followed Little Johnâ€™s shooting. That good-natured giant seemed
determined to outdo Tepus by a tiny margin in each separate shot; for
the first and the second shafts grazed his rivalâ€™s on the inner side,
while for the third Little John did the old trick of the forest: he
shot his own arrow in a graceful curve which descended from above upon
Tepusâ€™s final center shaft with a glancing blow that drove the other out
and left the outlawâ€™s in its place.
NA
fellow deserves either a dukedom or a hanging! He must be in league with

NA
NA
Gilbert now took his stand and slowly shot his arrows, one after
another, into the bullâ€™s-eye. â€˜Twas the best shooting he had yet
done, but there was still the smallest of spaces left--if you looked
closely--at the very center.
NA
NA
NA
NA
launched--â€œmayhap the King would have declared you the best bowman in
NA
But the last part of his merry speech was drowned in the wild tumult
of applause which followed his exploit. His first two shafts had packed
themselves into the small space left at the bullâ€™s-eye; while his third
had split down between them, taking half of each, and making all three
appear from a distance, as one immense arrow.
Up rose the King in amazement and anger.
NA
NA
Robin bowed low.
NA
NA
The King waved his hand sullenly.. Thereupon Robin prepared another old
trick of the greenwood, and got him a light, peeled willow wand which he
set in the ground in place of the target.
NA
NA
NA
But this final shot proved his undoing, and his shaft flew harmlessly
by the thin white streak. Then came Robin to his stand again, and picked
his arrow with exceeding care, and tried his string. Amid a breathless
pause he drew the good yew bow back to his ear, glanced along the shaft,
and let the feathered missile fly. Straight it sped, singing a keen note
of triumph as it went. The willow wand was split in twain, as though it
had met a hunterâ€™s knife.
NA
NA
NA
lightly. â€œFor willow wands do not grow upon the cobblestones of London
NA
Meanwhile the King in great wrath had risen to depart, first signing the
judges to distribute the prizes. Never a word said he, of good or
ill, to the Queen, but mounted his horse and, followed by his sons and
knights, rode off the field. The archers dropped upon one knee as he
passed, but he gave them a single baleful look and was gone.
Then the Queen beckoned the outlaws to approach, and they did so and
knelt at her feet.
NA
Kingâ€™s anger is aroused thereby. But fear ye not. His word and grace
hold true. As to these prizes ye have gained, I add others of mine
own--the wagers I have won from His Majesty the King and from the lord
Bishop of Hereford. Buy with some of these moneys the best swords ye
can find in London, for all your band, and call them the swords of the
Queen. And swear with them to protect all the poor and the helpless and
NA
NA
Then the Queen gave each of them her hand to kiss, and arose and
departed with all her ladies. And after they were gone, the Kingâ€™s
archers came crowding around Robin and his men, eager to get a glimpse
of the fellows about whom they had heard so much. And back of them came
a great crowd of the spectators pushing and jostling in their efforts to
come nearer.
NA
NA
Now the judges came up, and announced each man his prize, according
to the Kingâ€™s command. To Robin was give the purse containing twoscore
golden pounds; to Little John the twoscore silver pennies; and to
Allan-a-Dale the fine inlaid bugle, much to his delight, for he was
skilled at blowing sweet tunes upon the horn hardly less than handling
the harp strings. But when the Rhenish wine and English beer and harts
of Dallom Lea were spoken of, Robin said:
â€œNay, what need we of wine or beer, so far from the greenwood? And
â€˜twould be like carrying coals to Newcastle, to drive those harts to
Sherwood! Now Gilbert and Tepus and their men have shot passing well.
Wherefore, the meat and drink must go to them, an they will accept it of
NA
NA
all, and we will toast you every one, in memory of the greatest day at
NA
Thus said all the Kingâ€™s archers, and the hand of good-fellowship was
given amid much shouting and clapping on the shoulder-blades.
And so ended King Harryâ€™s tourney, whose story has been handed down from
sire to son, even unto the present day.
CHAPTER XIV
HOW ROBIN HOOD WAS SOUGHT OF THE TINKER
     And while the tinker fell asleep,
     Robin made haste away,
     And left the tinker in the lurch,
     For the great shot to pay.
King Henry was as good as his word. Robin Hood and his party were
suffered to depart from London--the parting bringing keen sorrow to
Marian--and for forty days no hand was raised against them. But at
the end of that time, the royal word was sent to the worthy Sheriff at
Nottingham that he must lay hold upon the outlaws without further delay,
as he valued his office.
Indeed, the exploits of Robin and his band, ending with the great
tourney in Finsbury Field, had made a mighty stir through all England,
and many there were to laugh boldly at the Nottingham official for his
failures to capture the outlaws.
The Sheriff thereupon planned three new expeditions into the greenwood,
and was even brave enough to lead them, since he had fifteen-score men
at his beck and call each time. But never the shadow of an outlaw did
he see, for Robinâ€™s men lay close, and the Sheriffâ€™s men knew not how to
come at their chief hiding-place in the cove before the cavern.
Now the Sheriffâ€™s daughter had hated Robin Hood bitterly in her heart
ever since the day he refused to bestow upon her the golden arrow, and
shamed her before all the company. His tricks, also, upon her father
were not calculated to lessen her hatred, and so she sought about for
means to aid the Sheriff in catching the enemy.

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
I will eâ€™en give you an hundred silver pennies for a new gown, and a

Now upon that same day, while the Sheriffâ€™s daughter was racking her
brains for a scheme, there came to the Mansion House a strolling tinker
named Middle, a great gossip and braggart. And as he pounded away upon
some pots and pans in the scullery, he talked loudly about what _he_
would do, if he once came within reach of that rascal Robin Hood.
â€œIt might be that this simple fellow could do something through his
NA
â€œOdds bodikins! â€˜twill do no harm to try his service, while I bethink
NA
And she called him to her, and looked him over--a big brawny fellow
enough, with an honest look about the eye, and a countenance so open
that when he smiled his mouth seemed the only country on the map.
NA
add goodly measure to the stated reward if you succeed. Do you wish to
NA
The tinker grinned broadly.
NA
â€œThen here is a warrant made out this morning by the Sheriff himself.
NA
And she dismissed him.
Middle departed from the house mightily pleased with himself, and
proud of his commission. He swung his crab-tree-staff recklessly in his
glee--so recklessly that he imperiled the shins of more than one angry
passer-by--and vowed heâ€™d crack the ribs of Robin Hood with it, though
he was surrounded by every outlaw in the whole greenwood.
Spurred on by the thoughts of his own coming bravery, he left the town
and proceeded toward Barnesdale. The day was hot and dusty, and at
noontime he paused at a wayside inn to refresh himself. He began by
eating and drinking and dozing, in turn, then sought to do all at once.
NA
with a drover.
â€œFolk do say that my lord Sheriff has sent into Lincoln for more
men-at-arms and horses, and that when he has these behind him, heâ€™ll

The tinker laid a heavy hand upon the innkeeperâ€™s fat shoulder, and
tried to look impressive.
â€œThere is your reckoning, host, upon the table. I must eâ€™en go upon my
way, because I have more important business than to stand here gossiping
with you. But be not surprised, if, the next time you see me, I shall
NA
And he strode loftily out the door and walked up the hot white road
toward Barnesdale.
He had not gone above a quarter of a mile when he met a young man with
curling brown hair and merry eyes. The young man carried his light cloak
over his arm, because of the heat, and was unarmed save for a light
sword at his side. The newcomer eyed the perspiring tinker in a friendly
way, and seeing he was a stout fellow accosted him.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhat news have you? Seeing that you go from town to town, I ween you
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI have a warrant from the Sheriff, sealed with the Kingâ€™s own seal, to
take him where I can; and if you can tell me where he is, I will eâ€™en

NA
NA
NA
And if youâ€™ll not help me to come at him I must forsooth catch him by

And he made his crab-tree-staff whistle shrill circles in the air.
The other smiled at the tinkerâ€™s simplicity, and said:
â€œThe middle of the road on a hot July day is not a good place to talk
things over. Now if youâ€™re the man for me and Iâ€™m the man for you, letâ€™s
go back to the inn, just beyond the bend of road, and quench our thirst
NA
NA
NA
NA
The landlord arched his eyebrows silently when he saw the two come in,
but served them willingly.
The tinker asked for wine, and Robin for ale. The wine was not the most
cooling drink in the cellar, nor the clearest headed. Nathless, the
tinker asked for it, since it was expensive and the other man had
invited him to drink. They lingered long over their cups, Master Middle
emptying one after another while the stranger expounded at great length
on the best plans for coming at and capturing Robin Hood.
In the end the tinker fell sound asleep while in the act of trying to
get a tankard to his lips. Then the stranger deftly opened the snoring
manâ€™s pouch, took out the warrant, read it, and put it in his own
wallet. Calling mine host to him, he winked at him with a half smile and
told him that the tinker would pay the whole score when he awoke. Thus
NA
Nathless, the stranger seemed in no great hurry. He had the whim to stay
awhile and see what the droll tinker might do when he awoke. So he hid
behind a window shutter, on the outside, and awaited events.
Presently the tinker came to himself with a prodigious yawn, and reached
at once for another drink.
â€œWhat were you saying, friend, about the best plan (ya-a-a-ah!) for

He had looked around and saw no one with him at the table.

â€œFaith, _I_ saw no need oâ€™ telling you! Did you not tell me the first

Middle thought this to be good advice; so he strode forth from the

Ere he had gone half a mile, he saw Robin Hood walking demurely among
the trees a little in front of him.
NA
NA
Robin turned about with a surprised face.
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhy, as I live, it is our honest tinker who was seeking Robin Hood! Did

NA
And he plunged at him, making a sweeping stroke with his
crab-tree-cudgel.
Robin tried to draw his sword, but could not do it for a moment through
dodging the otherâ€™s furious blows. When he did get it in hand, the
tinker had reached him thrice with resounding thwacks. Then the tables
were turned, for he dashed in right manfully with his shining blade and
made the tinker give back again.
The greenwood rang with the noise of the fray. â€˜Twas steel against
wood, and they made a terrible clattering when they came together. Robin
thought at first that he could hack the cudgel to pieces, for his blade
was one of Toledo--finely tempered steel which the Queen had given him.
But the crab-tree-staff had been fired and hardened and seasoned by the
tinkerâ€™s arts until it was like a bar of iron--no pleasant neighbor for
oneâ€™s ribs.
Robin presently found this out to his sorrow. The long reach and long
stick got to him when â€˜twas impossible for him to touch his antagonist.
So his sides began to ache sorely.
NA
NA
But even as he spoke, Robin found the momentâ€™s grace for which he
longed; and immediately grasped his horn and blew the three well-known
blasts of the greenwood.

But Robin was quite able to hold his own at a pinch, and they had not
exchanged many lunges and passes when up came Little John and Will

So amid great merriment and right good fellowship the outlaws shook
Middle by the hand, and he took oath of fealty, and thought no more of
the Sheriffâ€™s daughter.
CHAPTER XV
HOW ROBIN HOOD WAS TANNED OF THE TANNER
     In Nottingham there lived a jolly tanner,
     With a hey down, down, a down down!
     His name was Arthur-a-Bland,
     There was neâ€™er a squire in Nottinghamshire
     Dare bid bold Arthur stand.
     And as he went forth, in a summerâ€™s morning,
     With a hey down, down, a down down!
     To the forest of merrie Sherwood,
     To view the red deer, that range here and there,
     There met he with bold Robin Hood.
The Sheriffâ€™s daughter bided for several days in the faint hope that she
might hear tidings of the prattling tinker. But never a word heard she,
and she was forced to the conclusion that her messenger had not so much
as laid eyes upon the outlaw. Little recked she that he was, even then,
grinding sword-points and sharpening arrows out in the good greenwood,
while whistling blithely or chatting merrily with the good Friar Tuck.
Then she bethought herself of another good man, one Arthur-a-Bland, a
tanner who dwelt in Nottingham town and was far-famed in the tourneys
round about. He had done some pretty tricks at archery, but was
strongest at wrestling and the quarter-staff. For three years he had
cast all comers to the earth in wrestling until the famous Eric
oâ€™ Lincoln broke a rib for him in a mighty tussle. Howsoever, at
quarter-staff he had never yet met his match; so that there was never a
squire in Nottinghamshire dare bid bold Arthur stand.
     With a long pike-staff on his shoulder,
     So well he could clear his way
     That by two and three he made men flee
     And none of them could stay.
Thus at least runs the old song which tells of his might.
NA
herself; and she forthwith summoned him to the Mansion House and
commissioned him to seek out Robin Hood.
The warrant was quite to Arthurâ€™s liking, for he was happiest when out
in the forest taking a sly peep at the Kingâ€™s deer; and now he reckoned
that he could look at them boldly, instead of by the rays of the moon.
He could say to any Kingâ€™s Forester who made bold to stop him: â€œI am
NA
â€œGramercy! No more oak-bark and ditch-water and the smell of half-tanned
NA
NA
So the tanner departed joyfully upon his errand, but much more
interested in the dun deer of the forest than in any two-legged rovers
therein. This interest had, in fact, caused the Foresters to keep a
shrewd eye upon him in the past, for his tannery was apt to have plenty
of meat in it that was more like venison than the law allowed. As for
the outlaws, Arthur bore them no ill-will; indeed he had felt a secret
envy in his heart at their free life; but he was not afraid to meet any
two men who might come against him. Nathless, the Sheriffâ€™s daughter did
not choose a very good messenger, as you shall presently see.
Away sped the tanner, a piece of bread and some wine in his wallet,
a good longbow and arrows slung across his shoulder, his stout
quarter-staff in his hand, and on his head a cap of trebled raw-hide so
tough that it would turn the edge of a broadsword. He lost no time in
getting out of the hot sun and into the welcome shade of the forest,
where he stalked cautiously about seeking some sign of the dun deer.
Now it so chanced that upon that very morning Robin Hood had sent Little
John to a neighboring village to buy some cloth of Lincoln green for new
suits for all the band. Some of the money recently won of the King
was being spent in this fashion, â€˜gainst the approach of winter. Will
Scarlet had been sent on a similar errand to Barnesdale some time
before, if you remember, only to be chased up the hill without his
purchase. So to-day Little John was chosen, and for sweet companyâ€™s
sake Robin went with him a part of the way until they came to the â€œSeven
NA
tinker. Here they drank a glass of ale to refresh themselves withal,
and for good luck; and Robin tarried a bit while Little John went on his
errand.
Presently Robin entered the edge of the wood, when whom should he see
but Arthur-a-Bland, busily creeping after a graceful deer that browsed
NA
to himself. â€œI much fear that yon same fellow is a rascally poacher come
NA
For you must know, by a curious process of reasoning, Robin and his men
had hunted in the royal preserves so long that they had come to consider
themselves joint owners to every animal which roamed therein.
NA
NA
And forthwith he crept behind a tree, and thence to another, stalking
our friend Arthur as busily as Arthur was stalking the deer.
This went on for quite a space, until the tanner began to come upon the
deer and to draw his bow in order to tickle the victimâ€™s ribs with a
cloth-yard shaft. But just at this moment Robin unluckily trod upon a
twig which snapped and caused the tanner to turn suddenly.
Robin saw that he was discovered, so he determined to put a bold face on
the matter, and went forward with some smart show of authority.
NA
range so boldly here? In sooth, to be brief, ye look like a thief that
NA
NA
NA
NA
some sport in the matter. â€œI am a keeper of this forest. The King knows
that I am looking after his deer for him; and therefore we must stay

NA
NA
NA

oak-graff like unto yours. Give me a bakerâ€™s dozen of minutes with
it and it shall pleasure me to crack that pate of yours for your

â€œSoftly, my man! Fair and softly! Big words never killed so much as a
mouse--least of all yon deer which has got away while you were filling
all the woods with your noisy breath. So choose your own playthings. For
your sword and your bow I care not a straw; nor for all your arrows to
NA
NA
NA
So saying he unbuckled his belt; and, flinging his bow upon the ground
he seized hold of a young sapling that was growing near by. His hunting
knife soon had it severed and lopped into shape.
NA
if I do not tan your hide for you in better shape than ever calf-skin
NA
NA
NA
NA
as you will shortly find out. Eight foot and a half, and â€˜twill knock
NA
NA
Forthwith the two men spat on their hands, laid firm hold upon their
cudgels and began slowly circling round each other, looking for an
opening.
Now it so chanced that Little John had fared expeditiously with his
errand. He had met the merchant, from whom he was wont to buy Lincoln
green, coming along the road; and had made known his wants in few words.
The merchant readily undertook to deliver the suits by a certain day
in the following month. So Little John, glad to get back to the cool
shelter of the greenwood, hasted along the road lately taken by Robin.
Presently he heard the sound of angry voices, one of which he recognized
as his captainâ€™s.
NA
NA
So he cautiously made his way from tree to tree, as Robin had done, till
he came to the little open space where Robin and Arthur were circling
about each other with angry looks, like two dogs at bay.
NA
loved a good quarter-staff bout above anything else in the world, and
was the best man at it in all the greenwood. And he crawled quietly
underneath a friendly bush--much as he had done when Robin undertook to
teach Will Scarlet a lesson--and chuckled softly to himself and slapped
his thigh and prepared to watch the fight at his ease.
Indeed it was both exciting and laughable. You would have chuckled one
moment and caught your breath the next, to see those two stout fellows
swinging their sticks--each half as long again as the men were, and
thick as their arm--and edging along sidewise, neither wishing to strike
the first blow.
At last Robin could no longer forbear, and his good right arm swung
round like a flash. Ping! went the stick on the back of the otherâ€™s
head, raising such a welt that the blood came. But the tanner did not
seem to mind it at all, for bing! went his own staff in return, giving
Robin as good as he had sent. Then the battle was on, and furiously it
waged. Fast fell the blows, but few save the first ones landed, being
met in mid-air by a counter-blow till the thwacking sticks sounded like
the steady roll of a kettle-drum and the oak--bark flew as fine as it
had ever done in Arthur-a-Blandâ€™s tannery.
Round and round they fought, digging their heels into the ground to keep
from slipping, so that you would have vowed there had been a yoke of
oxen ploughing a potato-patch. Round and round, up and down, in and
out, their arms working like threshing-machines, went the yeoman and the
tanner, for a full hour, each becoming more astonished every minute that
the other was such a good fellow. While Little John from underneath his
bushy covert had much ado to keep from roaring aloud in pure joy.
Finally Robin saw his chance and brought a full arm blow straight down
upon the otherâ€™s head with a force that would have felled a bullock.
But Arthurâ€™s trebled cow-skin cap here stood him in good stead: the blow
glanced off without doing more than stunning him. Nathless, he reeled
and had much ado to keep from falling; seeing which Robin stayed
his hand--to his own sorrow, for the tanner recovered his wits in a
marvelous quick space and sent back a sidelong blow which fairly lifted
Robin off his feet and sent him tumbling on to the grass.
NA
he had left. â€œHold, I say, and I will give you the freedom of the

NA
NA
â€œWell, well, gossipâ€™ let be as it may. But prithee tell me your name and

for the present. Howsoever, there be others in this wood I would fain
see you tackle. Harkee, if you will leave your tan-pots and come with

gripped him gladly by the hand. â€œBut I am minded that I clean forgot the
errand that brought me to Sherwood. I was commissioned by some, under

loudly. â€œBut tell me, good Robin Hood, where is Little John? I fain
NA
NA
literally rolled out from under the bush to the sward. His eyes were
full of tears from much laughter which had well-nigh left him powerless
to get on his feet.
As soon as the astonished tanner saw who it was, he gave Little John a
mighty hug around the neck, and lifted him up on his feet, and the two
pounded each other on the back soundly, so glad were they to meet again.
NA
saw I so fine a sight in all my born days. You did knock him over like

HOW ROBIN HOOD MET SIR RICHARD OF THE LEA

     With words both fair and thee:
     â€œGod save thee, my good Robin,
NA
Now you must know that some months passed by. The winter dragged its
weary length through Sherwood Forest, and Robin Hood and his merry men
found what cheer they could in the big crackling fires before their
woodland cave. Friar Tuck had built him a little hermitage not far away,
where he lived comfortably with his numerous dogs.
The winter, I say, reached an end at last, and the blessed spring came
and went. Another summer passed on apace, and still neither King nor
Sheriff nor Bishop could catch the outlaws, who, meanwhile, thrived and
prospered mightily in their outlawry. The band had been increased
from time to time by picked men such as Arthur-a-Bland and David of
Doncaster--he who was the jolliest cobbler for miles around--until it
now numbered a full sevenscore of men; seven companies each with its
stout lieutenant serving under Robin Hood. And still they relieved the
purses of the rich, and aided the poor, and feasted upon Kingâ€™s deer
until the lank Sheriff of Nottingham was well-nigh distracted.
Indeed, that official would probable have lost his office entirely, had
it not been for the fact of the Kingâ€™s death. Henry passed away, as all
Kings will, in common with ordinary men, and Richard of the Lion Heart
was proclaimed as his successor.
Then Robin and his men, after earnest debate, resolved to throw
themselves upon the mercy of the new King, swear allegiance, and ask to
be organized into Royal Foresters. So Will Scarlet and Will Stutely and
Little John were sent to London with this message, which they were first
to entrust privately to Maid Marian. But they soon returned with bad
tidings. The new King had formerly set forth upon a crusade to the Holy
Land, and Prince John, his brother, was impossible to deal with--being
crafty, cruel and treacherous. He was laying his hands upon all the
property which could easily be seized; among other estates, that of
the Earl of Huntingdon, Robinâ€™s old enemy and Marianâ€™s father, who had
lately died.
Marian herself was in sore straits. Not only had her estates been taken
away, and the maid been deprived of the former protection of the Queen,
but the evil Prince John had persecuted her with his attentions. He
thought that since the maid was defenseless he could carry her away to
one of his castles and none could gainsay him.
No word of this peril reached Robinâ€™s ears, although his men brought
him word of the seizure of the Huntingdon lands. Nathless he was greatly
alarmed for the safety of Maid Marian, and his heart cried out for
her strongly. She had been continually in his thoughts ever since the
memorable shooting at London town.
One morning in early autumn when the leaves were beginning to turn gold
at the edges, the chestnut-pods to swell with promise of fatness, and
the whole wide woodland was redolent with the ripe fragrance of fruit
and flower, Robin was walking along the edge of a small open glade busy
with his thoughts. The peace of the woods was upon him, despite his
broodings of Marian and he paid little heed to a group of does quietly
feeding among the trees at the far edge of the glade.
But presently this sylvan picture was rudely disturbed for him. A stag,
wild and furious, dashed suddenly forth from among the trees, scattering
the does in swift alarm. The vicious beast eyed the green-and-gold tunic
of Robin, and, lowering it head, charged at him impetuously. So sudden
was its attack that Robin had no time to bend his bow. He sprang behind
a tree while he seized his weapon.
A moment later the wild stag crashed blindly into the tree-trunk with a
shock which sent the beast reeling backward, while the dislodged leaves
from the shivering tree fell in a small shower over Robinâ€™s head.
NA
 quoth Robin, fixing an arrow upon the string. â€œSorry indeed would be any
NA
Scarcely had he spoken when he saw the stag veer about and fix its
glances rigidly on the bushes to the left side of the glade. These were
parted by a delicate hand, and through the opening appeared the slight
figure of a page. It was Maid Marian, come back again to the greenwood!
She advanced, unconscious alike of Robinâ€™s horrified gaze and the evil
fury of the stag.
She was directly in line with the animal, so Robin dared not launch an
arrow. Her own bow was slung across her shoulder, and her small sword
would be useless against the beastâ€™s charge. But now as she caught sight
of the stag she pursed her lips as though she would whistle to it.
NA
in his throat.
With a savage snort of rage, the beast rushed at this new and inviting
target--rushed so swiftly and from so short a distance that she could
not defend herself. She sprang to one side as it charged down upon her,
but a side blow from its antlers stretched her upon the ground. The stag
stopped, turned, and lowered its head preparing to gore her to death.
Already its cruel horns were coming straight for her, while she, white
of face and bewildered by the sudden attack, was struggling to rise
and draw her sword. A moment more and the end would come. But the sharp
voice of Robin and already spoken.
NA
the shaft from Robinâ€™s bow went whizzing close above her head and struck
with terrific force full in the center of the stagâ€™s forehead.
The beast stumbled in its charge and fell dead, across the body of the
fainting maid.
Robin was quickly by her side, and dragged the beast from off the girl.
Picking her up in his strong arms, he bore her swiftly to the side of
one of the many brooks which watered the vale.
He dashed cool water upon her face, roughly almost, in his agony of fear
that the she was already dead, and he could have shed tears of joy to
see those poor, closed eyelids tremble. He redoubled his efforts; and
presently she gave a little gasp.
NA
â€œYou are in Sherwood, dear maid, thoâ€™, iâ€™ faith, we gave you a rude
NA
She opened her eyes and sat up. â€œMethinks you have rescued me from
NA
Then she recognized Robin for the first time, and a radiant smile came
over her face, together with the rare blush of returned vitality,
and her head sank upon his shoulder with a little tremble and sigh of
relief.
NA
NA
tones were deep and full of feeling. â€œI swear, dear Marian, that I will
NA
Not another word was spoken for some moments, while her head still
rested confidingly upon his breast. Then recollecting, he suddenly
cried:
â€œGramercy, I make but a poor nurse! I have not even asked if any of your
NA
NA
â€œThat foolish dizziness oâ€™ercame me for the nonce, but we can now
NA
NA
NA
So she told him how that the Prince had seized upon her fatherâ€™s lands,
and had promised to restore them to her if she would listen to his suit;
and how that she knew he meant her no good, for he was even then suing
for a Princessâ€™s hand.
NA
NA
Robinâ€™s brow had grown fiercely black at the recital of her wrong; and
he had laid stern hand upon the hilt of his sword. â€œBy this sword which
NA
the service of all womankind, I take oath that Prince John and all his
NA
So that is how Maid Marian came to take up her abode in the greenwood,
where the whole band of yeomen welcomed her gladly and swore fealty; and
where the sweet lady of Allan-a-Dale made her fully at home.
But this was a day of deeds in Sherwood Forest, and we â€˜gan to tell you
another happening which led to later events.
While Robin and Marian were having their encounter with the stag, Little
John, Much the millerâ€™s son, and Will Scarlet had sallied forth to watch
the highroad leading to Barnesdale, if perchance they might find some
haughty knight or fat priest whose wallet needed lightening.
They had scarcely watched the great road known as Watling Street which
runs from Dover in Kent to Chester town--for many minutes, when they
espied a knight riding by in a very forlorn and careless manner.
     All dreary was his semblance,
     And little was his pride,
     His one
     foot in the stirrup stood,
     His other waved beside.
     His visor hung down oâ€™er his eyes,
     He rode in single array,
     A sorrier man than he was one
     Rode never in summerâ€™s day.
Little John came up to the knight and bade him stay; for who can
judge of a manâ€™s wealth by his looks? The outlaw bent his knee in all
courtesy, and prayed him to accept the hospitality of the forest.
NA
NA
NA
NA
the knightâ€™s bridle.
Seeing the other two outlaws approaching, the knight shrugged his
shoulders, and replied indifferently.
NA
 quoth he, â€œand I go with you right willingly, my friends. My purpose
was to have dined to-day at Blyth or Doncaster; but nothing matters
NA
So in the same lackadaisical fashion which had marked all his actions
that day, the knight suffered his horse to be led to the rendezvous of
the band in the greenwood.
Marian had not yet had time to change her pageâ€™s attire, when the three
escorts of the knight hove in sight. She recognized their captive as Sir
Richard of the Lea, whom she had often seen at court; and fearing lest
he might recognize her, she would have fled. But Robin asked her, with a
twinkle, if she would not like to play page that day, and she in roguish
mood consented to do so.
NA
NA
NA
NA
So while his horse was cared for, the knight laid aside his own heavy
gear, and laved his face and hands, and sat down with Robin and all his
men to a most plentiful repast of venison, swans, pheasants, various
small birds, cake and ale. And Marian stood behind Robin and filled his
cup and that of the guest.
After eating right heartily of the good cheer, the knight brightened
up greatly and vowed that he had not enjoyed so good a dinner for nigh
three weeks. He also said that if ever Robin and his fellows should come
to his domains, he would strive to set them down to as good a dinner on
his own behalf.
But this was not exactly the sort of payment which Robin had expected to
receive. He thanked the knight, therefore, in set phrase, but reminded
him that a yeoman like himself might hardly offer such a dinner to a
knight as a gift of charity.
NA
little of the worldâ€™s goods, in sooth, that I should be ashamed to offer
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
He handed Little John his pouch, and Robin nodded carelessly.

NA
fellow gravely emptying the contents on his cloak.
Robin signed to Marian, who filled a bumper of wine for himself and his
guest.
NA
heartily, for these sorry times. I see that your armor is bent and that
your clothes are torn. Yet methinks I saw you at court, once upon a day,
and in more prosperous guise. Tell me now, were you a yeoman and made a
knight by force? Or, have you been a bad steward to yourself, and wasted
your property in lawsuits and the like? Be not bashful with us. We shall

before King Harry--God rest his bones! My name is Sir Richard of the
Lea, and I dwell in a castle, not a league from one of the gates of
Nottingham, which has belonged to my father, and his father, and his
fatherâ€™s father before him. Within two or three years ago my neighbors
might have told you that a matter of four hundred pounds one way or
the other was as naught to me. But now I have only these ten pennies of

NA
NA
King Richard upon a crusade, from which I am but lately returned, in
time to find my son--a goodly youth--grown up. He was but twenty, yet he
had achieved a squireâ€™s training and could play prettily in jousts and
tournaments and other knightly games. But about this time he had the ill
luck to push his sport too far, and did accidentally kill a knight in
the open lists. To save the boy, I had to sell my lands and mortgage my
ancestral castle; and this not being enough, in the end I have had to

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
whisper a word in Marianâ€™s ear. She nodded and drew Little John and Will
Scarlet aside and talked earnestly with them, in a low tone.
NA

NA
Will Scarlet and Little John had meanwhile fallen in with Marianâ€™s idea,
for they consulted the other outlaws, who nodded their heads. Thereupon
Little John and Will Scarlet went into the cave near by and presently
returned bearing a bag of gold. This they counted out before the
astonished knight; and there were four times one hundred gold pieces in
it.
NA
 then said Robin. â€œNay, no thanks; you are but exchanging creditors.
Mayhap we shall not be so hard upon you as the Christian Bishop; yet,
NA
There were actual tears in Sir Richardâ€™s eyes, as he essayed to thank
the foresters. But at this juncture, Much, the millerâ€™s son, came from
the cave dragging a bale of cloth. â€œThe knight should have a suit worthy
NA
NA
NA
NA
So the horse was given, also, and Robin bade Arthur-a-Bland ride with
the knight as far as his castle, as esquire.
The knight was sorrowful no longer; yet he could hardly voice his thanks
through his broken utterance. And having spent the night in rest,
after listening to Allan-a-Daleâ€™s singing, he mounted his new steed the
following morning an altogether different man.
NA
NA
NA
 said Robin, shaking him by the hand; â€œand then you will repay us the
NA
â€œI shall return it to you within the year, upon my honor as Sir Richard
NA
So saying the knight and his esquire rode down the forest glade till
they were lost to view.
CHAPTER XVII
HOW THE BISHOP WAS DINED
NA
     â€œOr for whom do you make this a-do?
     Or why do you kill the Kingâ€™s venison,
NA
NA
     â€œAnd we keep sheep all the year,
     And we are disposed to be merrie this day,
NA
Not many days after Sir Richard of the Lea came to Sherwood Forest,
word reached Robin Hoodâ€™s ears that my lord Bishop of Hereford would
be riding that way betimes on that morning. â€˜Twas Arthur-a-Bland, the
knightâ€™s quondam esquire, who brought the tidings, and Robinâ€™s face
brightened as he heard it.
NA
in the greenwood, and this is too fair a chance to let slip. Come, my
men, kill me a venison; kill me a good fat deer. The Bishop of Hereford
NA
NA
â€œNay, we play a droll game on the churchman. We will dress it by the
highway side, and watch for the Bishop narrowly, lest he should ride
NA
So Robin gave his orders, and the main body of his men dispersed to
different parts of the forest, under Will Stutely and Little John,
to watch other roads; while Robin Hood himself took six of his men,
including Will Scarlet, and Much, and posted himself in full view of the
main road. This little company appeared funny enough, I assure you, for
they had disguised themselves as shepherds. Robin had an old wool cap,
with a tail to it, hanging over his ear, and a shock of hair stood
straight up through a hole in the top. Besides there was so much dirt on
his face that you would never have known him. An old tattered cloak over
his hunterâ€™s garb completed his make-up. The others were no less ragged
and unkempt, even the foppish Will Scarlet being so badly run down at
the heel that the court ladies would hardly have had speech with him.
They quickly provided themselves with a deer and made great preparations
to cook it over a small fire, when a little dust was seen blowing along
the highway, and out of it came the portly Bishop cantering along with
ten men-at-arms at his heels. As soon as he saw the fancied shepherds he
spurred up his horse, and came straight toward them.
NA
sharply.
NA
awkwardly.
â€œHeaven have mercy! Ye seem a sorry lot of shepherds. But who gave you
NA
â€œâ€˜Tis one of our feast days, lording, and we were disposed to be merry
NA
NA
â€œGive me first your name, excellence, so that I may speak where â€˜tis
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
your heads will pay for your manners. Come! quit your stolen roast and
march along with me, for you shall be brought before the Sheriff of
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
But Robin had already sprung away with his back against a tree. And
from underneath his ragged cloak he drew his trusty horn and winded the
piercing notes which were wont to summon the band.
The Bishop no sooner saw this action than he knew his man, and that
there was a trap set; and being an arrant coward, he wheeled his horse
sharply and would have made off down the road; but his own men, spurred
on the charge, blocked his way. At almost the same instant the bushes
round about seemed literally to become alive with outlaws. Little Johnâ€™s
men came from one side and Will Stutelyâ€™s from the other. In less time
than it takes to tell it, the worthy Bishop found himself a prisoner,
and began to crave mercy from the men he had so lately been ready to
sentence.
NA
     â€œO pardon, I you pray.
     For if I had known it had been you,
NA
NA
than you would have treated me. Come, make haste, and go along with me.
NA
So the unwilling prelate was dragged away, cheek by jowl, with the
half-cooked venison upon the back of his own horse; and Robin and his
band took charge of the whole company and led them through the forest
glades till they came to an open space near Barnesdale.
Here they rested, and Robin gave the Bishop a seat full courteously.
Much the millerâ€™s son fell to roasting the deer afresh, while another
and fatter beast was set to frizzle on the other side of the fire.
Presently the appetizing odor of the cooking reached the Bishopâ€™s
nostrils, and he sniffed it eagerly. The morningâ€™s ride had made him
hungry; and he was nothing loath when they bade him come to the dinner.
Robin gave him the best place beside himself, and the Bishop prepared to
fall to.
â€œNay, my lord, craving your pardon, but we are accustomed to have grace
NA
NA
The Bishop reddened, but pronounced grace in the Latin tongue hastily,
and then settled himself to make the best of his lot. Red wines and ale
were brought forth and poured out, each man having a horn tankard from
which to drink.
Laughter bubbled among the diners, and the Bishop caught himself smiling
at more than one jest. But who, in sooth, could resist a freshly broiled
venison streak eaten out in the open air to the tune of jest and good
fellowship? Stutely filled the Bishopâ€™s beaker with wine each time he
emptied it, and the Bishop got mellower and mellower as the afternoon
shades lengthened on toward sunset. Then the approaching dusk warned him
of his position.
NA
but one cup of ale, â€œthat you would now call a reckoning. â€˜Tis late, and
I fear the cost of this entertainment may be more than my poor purse can
NA
For he bethought himself of his friend, the Sheriffâ€™s former experience.
NA
NA
NA
NA
collected Sir Richardâ€™s debt only that morning, and was even then
carrying it home.
NA
gold in my saddle-bags, â€˜tis for the church. Ye surely would not levy
NA
But Little John was already gone to the saddle-bags, and returning
he laid the Bishopâ€™s cloak upon the ground, and poured out of the
portmantua a matter of four hundred glittering gold pieces. â€˜Twas the
identical money which Robin had lent Sir Richard a short while before!
NA
church is always willing to aid in charity. And seeing this goodly sum
reminds me that I have a friend who is indebted to a churchman for this
exact amount. Now we shall charge you nothing on our own account; but
NA
NA
indeed. Was this not the Kingâ€™s meat, after all, that we feasted upon?
NA
NA
Hereford, and does not the whole countryside speak of your oppression?
Who does not know of your cruelty to the poor and ignorant--you who
should use your great office to aid them, instead of oppress? Have you
not been guilty of far greater robbery than this, even though less
open? Of myself, and how you have pursued me, I say nothing; nor of
your unjust enmity against my father. But on account of those you have
despoiled and oppressed, I take this money, and will use it far more
worthily than you would. God be my witness in this! There is an end of
the matter, unless you will lead us in a song or dance to show that
your body had a better spirit than your mind. Come, strike up the harp,
NA
NA
NA
Arthur-a-Bland seized the fat struggling churchman and commenced to hop
up and down. The Bishop being shorter must perforce accompany them in
their gyrations; while the whole company sat and rolled about over the
ground, and roared to see my lord of Herefordâ€™s queer capers. At last he
sank in a heap, fuddled with wine and quite exhausted.
Little John picked him up as though he were a log of wood and carrying
him to his horse, set him astride facing the animalâ€™s tail; and thus
fastened him, leading the animal toward the highroad and, starting the
Bishop, more dead than alive, toward Nottingham.
CHAPTER XVIII
HOW THE BISHOP WENT OUTLAW-HUNTING
     The Bishop he came to the old womanâ€™s house,
     And called with furious mood,
     â€œCome let me soon see, and bring unto me
NA
The easy success with which they had got the better of the good Bishop
led Robin to be a little careless. He thought that his guest was too
great a coward to venture back into the greenwood for many a long day;
and so after lying quiet for one day, the outlaw ventured boldly upon
the highway, the morning of the second. But he had gone only half a mile
when, turning a sharp bend in the road, he plunged full upon the prelate
himself.
My lord of Hereford had been so deeply smitten in his pride, that he
had lost no time in summoning a considerable body of the Sheriffâ€™s men,
offering to double the reward if Robin Hood could be come upon. This
company was now at his heels, and after the first shock of mutual
surprise, the Bishop gave an exultant shout and spurred upon the outlaw.
It was too late for Robin to retreat by the way he had come, but quick
as a flash he sprang to one side of the road, dodged under some bushes,
and disappeared so suddenly that his pursuers thought he had truly been
swallowed up by magic.
NA
him, while the rest of us will keep on the main road and head him off on
NA
For, truth to tell, the Bishop did not care to trust his bones away from
the highroad.
About a mile away, on the other side of this neck of woods, wherein
Robin had been trapped, was a little tumbledown cottage. â€˜Twas where
the widow lived, whose three sons had been rescued. Robin remembered the
cottage and saw his one chance to escape.
Doubling in and out among the underbrush and heather with the agility
of a hare, he soon came out of the wood in the rear of the cottage, and
thrust his head through a tiny window.
The widow, who had been at her spinning wheel, rose up with a cry of
alarm.
NA
â€œThey should be with you, Robin. Well do you know that. Do they not owe
NA
NA
NA
NA
change your raiment with me, and we will see if my lord knows an old
NA
NA
spindle and twine; and I will give you my green mantle and everything
NA
While they were talking, Robin had been nimbly changing clothes with the
old woman, through the window, and in a jiffy he stood forth complete,
even to the spindle and twine.
Presently up dashed the Bishop and his men, and, at sight of the
cottage and the old woman, gave pause. The crone was hobbling along with
difficulty, leaning heavily upon a gnarled stick and bearing the spindle
on her other arm. She would have gone by the Bishopâ€™s company, while
muttering to herself, but the Bishop ordered one of his men to question
her. The soldier laid his hand upon her shoulder.
NA
NA
her curses. â€œIâ€™ll not molest you. But my lord Bishop of Hereford wants
NA
NA
prevent good Robin from coming to see me and bring me food and raiment?
NA
NA
But weâ€™ll take you to Barnesdale and burn you for a witch if you do not
NA
NA
NA
NA
cottage, my men. Fire it, if need be. But Iâ€™ll give a purse of gold
NA
The old woman, being released, went on her way slowly. But it might
have been noticed that the farther she got away from the company and
the nearer to the edge of the woods, the swifter and straighter grew
her pace. Once inside the shelter of the forest she broke into a run of
surprising swiftness.
NA
here? Never saw I witch or woman run so fast. Methinks Iâ€™ll send an
NA
NA
Robin Hood. Summon the yeomen and return with me speedily. We have still
NA
When Little John could catch his breath from laughing, he winded his
horn.
NA
NA
Meanwhile, back at the widowâ€™s cottage the Bishop was growing more
furious every moment. For all his bold words, he dared not fire the
house, and the sturdy door had thus far resisted all his menâ€™s efforts.
NA
NA
At last the door crashed in and the men stood guard on the threshold.
But not one dared enter for fear a sharp arrow should meet him halfway.
NA
NA
NA
NA
But the joy of the Bishop over his capture was short lived. Down the
road came striding the shabby figure of the old woman who had helped him
set the trap; and very wrathy was she when she saw that the cottage door
had been battered in.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
pass when our homes may be treated like common gaols. Couldnâ€™t all your
men catch one poor forester without this ado? Come! clear out, you and
your robber, on the instant, or Iâ€™ll curse every motherâ€™s son of ye,
NA
NA
word. â€œWeâ€™ll see about a witchâ€™s cursing. Back to town she shall go,
NA
NA
And at the signal a goodly array of greenwood men sprang forth from all
sides of the cottage, with bows drawn back threateningly. The Bishop saw
that his men were trapped again, for they dared not stir. Nathless, he
determined to make a fight for it.
NA
shall sound the death of your master, Robin Hood! My men have him here
NA
NA
voice from under the widowâ€™s cape; and the outlaw chief stood forth with
bared head, smilingly. â€œHere am I, my lord, in no wise imperiled by your
NA
The old woman who, in the garb of Robin Hood, had been lying quiet in
the cottage through all the uproar, jumped up nimbly at this. In the
bald absurdity of her disguise she came to the doorway and bowed to the
Bishop.
NA
what does your Grace at my humble door? Do you come to bless me and give
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
not upon your unchurchly lips. But I will trouble you to hand over that

NA
what would have been so, if he could do the ordering of things. â€œHave at
NA
NA
sudden shaft he shot so close to the Bishopâ€™s head that it carried away
both his hat and the skull-cap which he always wore, leaving him quite
bald.
The prelate turned as white as his shiny head and clutched wildly at his
ears. He thought himself dead almost.
NA
NA
And without waiting for further parley he fairly bolted down the road.
His men being left leaderless had nothing for it but to retreat after
him, which they did in sullen order, covered by the bows of the yeomen.
And thus ended the Bishop of Herefordâ€™s great outlaw-hunt in the forest.
CHAPTER XIX
HOW THE SHERIFF HELD ANOTHER SHOOTING MATCH
     â€œTo tell the truth, Iâ€™m well informed
     Yon match it is a wile;
     The Sheriff, I know, devises this
NA
Now the Sheriff was so greatly troubled in heart over the growing power
of Robin Hood, that he did a very foolish thing. He went to London town
to lay his troubles before the King and get another force of troops to
cope with the outlaws. King Richard was not yet returned from the Holy
Land, but Prince John heard him with scorn.
NA
this? Art thou not sheriff for me? The law is in force to take thy
course of them that injure thee. Go, get thee gone, and by thyself
devise some tricking game to trap these rebels; and never let me see thy
NA
So away went the Sheriff in sorrier pass than ever, and cudgeled his
brain, on the way home, for some plan of action.
His daughter met him on his return and saw at once that he had been on a
poor mission. She was minded to upbraid him when she learned what he
had told the Prince. But the words of the latter started her to thinking
afresh.
NA
shooting-match? â€˜Tis Fair year, as you know, and another tourney will
be expected. Now we will proclaim a general amnesty, as did King Harry
himself, and say that the field is open and unmolested to all comers.
NA
NA
NA
So the Sheriff lost no time in proclaiming a tourney, to be held that
same Fall at the Fair. It was open to all comers, said the proclamation,
and none should be molested in their going and coming. Furthermore, an
arrow with a golden head and shaft of silver-white should be given to
the winner, who would be heralded abroad as the finest archer in all the
North Countree. Also, many rich prizes were to be given to other clever
archers.
These tidings came in due course to Robin Hood, under the greenwood
tree, and fired his impetuous spirit.
NA
NA
With that stepped forth the merry cobbler, David of Doncaster.
NA
tell the truth, Iâ€™m well informed yon match is naught but a trap. I know
NA
NA
NA
Then up spoke Little John and said: â€œCome, listen to me how it shall be
NA
     â€œOur mantles all of Lincoln-green
     Behind us we will leave;
     Weâ€™ll dress us all so several,
NA
     â€œOne shall wear white, another red,
     One yellow, another blue;
     Thus in disguise to the exercise
NA
This advice met with general favor from the adventurous fellows, and
they lost no time in putting it into practice. Maid Marian and Mistress
Dale, assisted by Friar Tuck, prepared some vari-colored costumes, and
â€˜gainst the Fair day had fitted out the sevenscore men till you would
never have taken them for other than villagers decked for the holiday.
And forth went they from the greenwood, with hearts all firm and stout,
resolved to meet the Sheriffâ€™s men and have a merry bout. Along the
highway they fell in with many other bold fellows from the countryside,
going with their ruddy-cheeked lasses toward the wide-open gates of
Nottingham.
So in through the gates trooped the whole gay company, Robinâ€™s men
behaving as awkwardly and laughing and talking as noisily as the rest;
while the Sheriffâ€™s scowling men-at-arms stood round about and sought to
find one who looked like a forester, but without avail.
The herald now set forth the terms of the contest, as on former
occasions, and the shooting presently began. Robin had chosen five of
his men to shoot with him, and the rest were to mingle with the crowd
and also watch the gates. These five were Little John, Will Scarlet,
Will Stutely, Much, and Allan-a-Daleâ€™.
The other competitors made a brave showing on the first round,
especially Gilbert of the White Hand, who was present and never shot
better. The contest later narrowed down between Gilbert and Robin. But
at the first lead, when the butts were struck so truly by various well
known archers, the Sheriff was in doubt whether to feel glad or sorry.
He was glad to see such skill, but sorry that the outlaws were not in
it.
     Some said, â€œIf Robin Hood were here,
     And all his men to boot,
     Sure none of them could pass these men,
NA
NA
     â€œI thought he would be here;
     I thought he would, but thoâ€™ heâ€™s bold,
NA
This word was privately brought to Robin by David of Doncaster, and the
saying vexed him sorely. But he bit his lip in silence.
NA
NA
Meantime the shooting had been going forward, and Robinâ€™s men had done
so well that the air was filled with shouts.
NA
NA
      But the fourth man said, â€œYon man in red
NA
     For that was Robin Hood himself,
     For he was clothed in red,
     At every shot the prize he got,
     For he was both sure and dead.
Thus went the second round of the shooting, and thus the third and last,
till even Gilbert of the White Hand was fairly beaten. During all this
shooting, Robin exchanged no word with his men, each treating the other
as a perfect stranger. Nathless, such great shooting could not pass
without revealing the archers.
The Sheriff thought he discovered, in the winner of the golden arrow,
the person of Robin Hood without peradventure. So he sent word privately
for his men-at-arms to close round the group. But Robinâ€™s men also got
wind of the plan.
To keep up appearances, the Sheriff summoned the crowd to form in a
circle; and after as much delay as possible the arrow was presented. The
delay gave time enough for the soldiers to close in. As Robin received
his prize, bowed awkwardly, and turned away, the Sheriff, letting his
zeal get the better of his discretion, grasped him about the neck and
called upon his men to arrest the traitor.
But the moment the Sheriff touched Robin, he received such a buffet
on the side of his head that he let go instantly and fell back several
paces. Turning to see who had struck him, he recognized Little John.
NA
Just then, however, he met a new check.
NA
NA
palm upon the Sheriffâ€™s cheek sending that worthy rolling over and over
upon the ground.
By this time the conflict had become general, but the Sheriffâ€™s men
suffered the disadvantage of being hampered by the crowd of innocent
on-lookers, whom they could not tell from the outlaws and so dared not
attack; while the other outlaws in the rear fell upon them and put them
in confusion.
For a moment a fierce rain of blows ensued; then the clear bugle-note
from Robin ordered a retreat. The two warders at the nearest gate tried
to close it, but were shot dead in their tracks. David of Doncaster
threw a third soldier into the moat; and out through the gate went
the foresters in good order, keeping a respectful distance between
themselves and the advancing soldiery, by means of their well-directed
shafts.
But the fight was not to go easily this day, for the soldiery, smarting
from their recent discomfiture at the widowâ€™s cottage, and knowing that
the eyes of the whole shire were upon them, fought well, and pressed
closely after the retreating outlaws. More than one ugly wound was
given and received. No less than five of the Sheriffâ€™s men were killed
outright, and a dozen others injured; while four of Robinâ€™s men were
bleeding from severe flesh cuts.
Then Little John, who had fought by the side of his chief, suddenly fell
forward with a slight moan. An arrow had pierced his knee. Robin seized
the big fellow with almost superhuman strength.
     Up he took him on his back,
     And bare him well a mile;
     Many a time he laid him down,
     And shot another while.
Meanwhile Little John grew weaker and closed his eyes; at last he sank
to the ground, and feebly motioned Robin to let him lie. â€œMaster
NA
NA
NA
â€œThen if ever you loved me, and for the sake of that service, draw your
bright brown sword and strike off my head; never let me fall alive into

â€œNot for all the gold in England would I do either of the things you

NA
his wounded kinsman upon his own broad shoulders, he soon brought him
within the shelter of the forest.
Once there, the Sheriffâ€™s men did not follow; and Robin caused litters
of boughs to be made for Little John and the other four wounded men.
Quickly were they carried through the wood until the hermitage of Friar
Tuck was reached, where their wounds were dressed. Little Johnâ€™s hurt
was pronounced to be the most serious of any, but he was assured that
in two or three weeksâ€™ time he could get about again; whereat the active
giant groaned mightily.
That evening consternation came upon the hearts of the band. A careful
roll-call was taken to see it all the yeomen had escaped, when it was
found that Will Stutely was missing, and Maid Marian also was nowhere to
be found. Robin was seized with dread. He knew that Marian had gone to
the Fair, but felt that she would hardly come to grief. Her absence,
however, portended some danger, and he feared that it was connected with
Will Stutely. The Sheriff would hang him speedily and without mercy, if
he were captured.
The rest of the band shared their leaderâ€™s uneasiness, though they said
no word. They knew that if Will were captured, the battle must be fought
over again the next day, and Will must be saved at any cost. But no man
flinched from the prospect.
That evening, while the Sheriff and his wife and daughter sat at meat in
the Mansion House, the Sheriff boasted of how he would make an example
of the captured outlaw; for Stutely had indeed fallen into his hands.
NA

soon see who is master in this shire. I am only sorry that we let them

As he spoke a missive sped through a window and fell clattering upon his
plate, causing him to spring back in alarm.
It was the golden arrow, and on its feathered shaft was sewed a little
note which read:
â€œThis from one who will take no gifts from liars; and who henceforth

CHAPTER XX
HOW WILL STUTELY WAS RESCUED
     Forth of the greenwood are they gone,
     Yea, all courageously,
     Resolving to bring Stutely home,
     Or every man to die.
The next day dawned bright and sunny. The whole face of nature seemed
gay as if in despite of the tragedy which was soon to take place in the
walls of Nottingham town. The gates were not opened upon this day, for
the Sheriff was determined to carry through the hanging of Will Stutely
undisturbed. No man, therefore, was to be allowed entrance from without,
all that morning and until after the fatal hour of noon, when Willâ€™s
soul was to be launched into eternity.
Early in the day Robin had drawn his men to a point, as near as he
dared, in the wood where he could watch the road leading to the East
gate. He himself was clad in a bright scarlet dress, while his men, a
goodly array, wore their suits of sober Lincoln green. They were armed
with broadswords, and â€˜each man carried his bow and a full quiver of new
arrows, straightened and sharpened cunningly by Middle, the tinker. Over
their greenwood dress, each man had thrown a rough mantle, making him
look not unlike a friar.
NA
hiding for a season while we sent some one forth to obtain tidings.
For, in sooth, â€˜twill work no good to march upon the gates if they be
NA
NA
along the road from the town. Belike he can tell us how the land ties,
and if Stutely be really in jeopardy. Shall I go out and engage him in

NA
So Stout Will went out from the band while the others hid themselves
and waited. When he had come close to the palmer, who seemed a slight,
youngish man, he doffed his hat full courteously and said,
â€œI crave your pardon, holy man, but can you tell me tidings of

NA
I have passed the very spot where the gallows-tree is going up. â€˜Tis out
upon the roadway near the Sheriffâ€™s castle. One, Will Stutely, is to be
NA
The palmer spoke in a muffled voice; and as his hood was pulled well
over his head, Stout Will could not discern what manner of man he was.
Over his shoulder he carried a long staff, with the fashion of a little
cross at one end; and he had sandaled feet like any monk. Stout Will
notice idly that the feet were very small and white, but gave no second
thought to the matter.
NA
asked reproachfully.
The question seemed to put a new idea into the palmerâ€™s head. He turned
so quickly that he almost dropped his hood.
NA
â€œBy Saint Peter and the Blessed Virgin, I do indeed! Else, who will
do it? The Bishop and all his whining clerks may be there, but not one

NA
NA
 replied Will.
NA
get into the city. You may know that the gates are fast locked, for this
morning, to all who would come in, although they let any pass out who

NA
NA
So the palmer pulled his cloak still closer about him and was brought
before Robin Hood, to whom he told all he knew of the situation. He
ended with,
â€œIf I may make so bold, I would not try to enter the city from this
gate, as â€˜tis closely guarded since yesterday. But on the far side, no
NA
NA
NA
So the men marched silently but quickly until they were near to the
western gate. Then Arthur-a-Bland asked leave to go ahead as a scout,
and quietly made his way to a point under the tower by the gate. The
moat was dry on this side, as these were times of peace, and Arthur was
further favored by a stout ivy vine which grew out from an upper window.
Swinging himself up boldly by means of this friendly vine, he crept
through the window and in a moment more had sprung upon the warder from
behind and gripped him hard about the throat. The warder had no chance
to utter the slightest sound, and soon lay bound and gagged upon the
floor; while Arthur-a-Bland slipped himself into his uniform and got
hold of his keys.
â€˜Twas the work of but a few moments more to open the gates, let down the
bridge, and admit the rest of the band; and they lot inside the town so
quietly that none knew of their coming. Fortune also favored them in the
fact that just at this moment the prison doors had been opened for
the march of the condemned man, and every soldier and idle lout in the
market-lace had trooped thither to see him pass along.
Presently out came Will Stutely with firm step but dejected air. He
looked eagerly to the right hand and to the left, but saw none of the
band. And though more than one curious face betrayed friendship in it,
he knew there could be no aid from such source.
Willâ€™s hands were tied behind his back. He marched between rows of
soldiery, and the Sheriff and the Bishop brought up the rear on horses,
looking mightily puffed up and important over the whole proceeding. He
would show these sturdy rebels--would the Sheriff--whose word was law!
He knew that the gates were tightly fastened; and further he believed
that the outlaws would hardly venture again within the walls, even if
the gates were open. And as he looked around at the fivescore archers
and pikemen who lined the way to the gallows, he smiled with grim
satisfaction.
Seeing that no help was nigh, the prisoner paused at the foot of the
scaffold and spoke in a firm tone to the Sheriff.
NA
for my noble master neâ€™er yet had a man that was hanged on a tree:
     Give me a sword all in my hand,
     And let me be unbound,
     And with thee and thy men will I fight
NA
But the Sheriff would by no means listen to his request; but swore
that he should be hanged a shameful death, and not die by the sword
valiantly.
NA
     â€œThou shalt on the gallows die,
     Aye, and so shall they master too,
NA
NA
     â€œFaint-hearted peasant slave!
     If ever my master do thee meet,
NA
     â€œMy noble master thee doth scorn,
     And all thy cowardly crew,
     Such silly imps unable are
NA
This brave speech was not calculated to soothe the Sheriff. â€œTo the
NA
was pushed into the rude cart which was to bear him under the gallows
until his neck was leashed. Then the cart would be drawn roughly away
and the unhappy man would swing out over the tail of it into another
world.
But at this moment came a slight interruption. A boyish-looking palmer
stepped forth, and said:
â€œYour Excellency, let me at least shrive this poor wretchâ€™s soul ere it
NA
NA
NA
NA
The Bishop hesitated. Like the Sheriff, he wanted no delay; but
the people were beginning to mutter among themselves and move about
uneasily. He said a few words to the Sheriff, and the latter nodded to
the monk ungraciously.
NA
NA
NA
But the palmer paid no heed to his last words. He began to tell his
beads quickly, and to speak in a low voice to the condemned man. But he
did not touch his bonds.
Then came another stir in the crowd, and one came pushing through the
press of people and soldiery to come near to the scaffold.
NA
 cried out the well-known voice of Much, the millerâ€™s son.
At the word the palmer stepped back suddenly and looked to one side. The
Sheriff also knew the speaker.
NA
cook who once did rob me of my silver plate. Weâ€™ll make a double hanging
NA
NA
and then hang him. But meanwhile I would like to borrow my friend of you
NA
And with one stroke of his keen hunting-knife he cut the bonds which
fastened the prisonerâ€™s arms, and Stutely leaped lightly from the cart.
NA
NA
So saying he spurred his horse fiercely forward, and rising in his
stirrups brought down his sword with might and main at Muchâ€™s head. But
his former cook dodged nimbly underneath the horse and came up on the
other side, while the weapon whistled harmlessly in the air.
NA
NA
Thereupon he snatched the weapon deftly from the Sheriffâ€™s hand.
NA
NA
Meanwhile the soldiers had recovered from their momentary surprise and
had flung themselves into the fray. A clear bugle-note had also sounded
the same which the soldiers had learned to dread. â€˜Twas the rallying
note of the green wood men.
Cloth yard shafts began to hurtle through the air, and Robin and his men
cast aside their cloaks and sprang forward crying:
NA
On the instant, a terrible scene of hand to hand fighting followed. The
Sheriffâ€™s men, though once more taken by surprise, were determined to
sell this rescue dearly. They packed in closely and stubbornly about
the condemned man and Much and the palmer, and it was only by desperate
rushes that the foresters made an opening in the square. Ugly cuts and
bruises were exchanged freely; and lucky was the man who escaped with
only these. Many of the onlookers, who had long hated the Sheriff and
felt sympathy for Robinâ€™s men, also plunged into the conflict--although
they could not well keep out of it, in sooth!--and aided the rescuers no
little.
At last with a mighty onrush, Robin cleaved a way through the press to
the scaffold itself, and not a second too soon; for two men with pikes
had leaped upon the cart, and were in the act of thrusting down upon the
palmer and Will Stutely. A mighty upward blow from Robinâ€™s good blade
sent the pike flying from the hand of one, while a well-directed arrow
from the outskirt pierced the other fellowâ€™s throat.
NA
NA
NA
fainthearted and â€˜gan to give back. But the field was not yet won, for
they retreated in close order toward the East gate, resolved to hem
the attackers within the city walls. Here again, however, they were in
error, since the outlaws did not go out by their nearest gate. They
made a sally in that direction, in order to mislead the soldiery, then
abruptly turned and headed for the West gate, which was still guarded by
Arthur-a-Bland.
The Sheriffâ€™s men raised an exultant shout at this, thinking they had
the enemy trapped. Down they charged after them, but the outlaws made
good their lead, and soon got through the gate and over the bridge which
had been let down by Arthur-a-Bland.
Close upon their heels came the soldiers--so close, that Arthur had no
time to close the gate again or raise the bridge. So he threw away his
key and fell in with the yeomen, who now began their retreat up the long
hill to the woods.
On this side the town, the road leading to the forest was long and
almost unprotected. The greenwood men were therefore in some distress,
for the archers shot at them from loop-holes in the walls, and the
pikemen were reinforced by a company of mounted men from the castle. But
the outlaws retreated stubbornly and now and again turned to hold their
pursuers at bay by a volley of arrows. Stutely was in their midst,
fighting with the energy of two; and the little palmer was there also,
but took no part save to keep close to Robinâ€™s side and mutter silent
words as though in prayer.
Robin put his horn to his lips to sound a rally, when a flying arrow
from the enemy pierced his hand. The palmer gave a little cry and sprang
forward. The Sheriff, who followed close with the men on horseback, also
saw the wound and gave a great huzza.
NA
shouted.
NA
despite the streaming blood; â€œI have saved one shot for you all this
NA
And he fitted the same arrow, which had wounded him, upon the string
of his bow and let it fly toward the Sheriffâ€™s head. The Sheriff fell
forward upon his horse in mortal terror, but not so quickly as to escape
unhurt. The sharp point laid bare a deep gash upon his scalp and must
certainly have killed him if it had come closer.
The fall of the Sheriff discomfited his followers for the moment, and
Robinâ€™s men took this chance to speed on up the hill. The palmer had
whipped out a small white handkerchief and tried to staunch Robinâ€™s
wound as they went. At sight of the palmerâ€™s hand, Robin turned with a
start, and pushed back the otherâ€™s hood.
NA
It was indeed Maid Marian, who had helped save Will, and been in the
stress of battle from the first. Now she hung her head as though caught
in wrong.
NA
NA
Their further talk was interrupted by an exclamation from Will Scarlet.
NA
hill, toward which they were pressing.
There from out a gray castle poured a troop of men, armed with pikes and
axes, who shouted and came running down upon them. At the same instant,
the Sheriffâ€™s men also renewed the pursuit.
NA
NA
spirit sank as he looked about for some outlet.
Then--oh, joyful sight!--he recognized among the foremost of those
coming from the castle the once doleful knight, Sir Richard of the Lea.
He was smiling now, and greatly excited.
NA
welcome sights and sounds than these. With a great cheer the outlaws
raced up the hill to meet their new friends; and soon the whole force
had gained the shelter of the castle. Bang! went the bridge as it swung
back, with great clanking of chains. Clash! went one great door upon the
other, as they shut in the outlaw band, and shut out the Sheriff, who
dashed up at the head of his men, his bandaged face streaked with blood
and inflamed with rage.
CHAPTER XXI
HOW SIR RICHARD OF THE LEA REPAID HIS DEBT
     The proud Sheriff loud â€˜gan cry
     And said, â€œThou traitor knight,

And Sir Richard snapped his fingers and disappeared from the walls. The
Sheriff, after lingering a few moments longer in hope of further parley,
was forced to withdraw, swearing fiercely.
NA

Meanwhile the knight had gone back to Robin Hood, and the two men
NA
taking him in his arms. â€œWell met, indeed! The Lord has lately prospered
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Sir Richard smiled, but said no more at the time. Robin was made to rest
until dinner should be served. Meanwhile a leech bound up his hand with
ointment, promising him that he should soon have its use again. Some
halfscore others of the yeomen had been hurt in the fight, but luckily
none of grave moment. They were all bandaged and made happy by bumpers
of ale.
At dinner Sir Richard presented Robin to his wife and son. The lady was
stately and gracious, and made much of Marian, whom she had known as
a little girl and who was now clothed more seemly for a dinner than in
monkish garments. The young esquire was a goodly youth and bade fair to
make as stout a knight as his father.
The feast was a joyous event. There were two long tables, and two
hundred men sat down at them, and ate and drank and afterward sang
songs. An hundred and forty of these men wore Lincoln green and called
Robin Hood their chief. Never, I ween, had there been a more gallant
company at table in Lea Castle!
That night the foresters tarried within the friendly walls, and the next
day took leave; though Sir Richard protested that they should have made
a longer stay. And he took Robin aside to his strong room and pressed
him again to take the four hundred golden pounds. But his guest was
firm.
NA
NA
Sir Richard thanked him in a few earnest words, and asked him and all
his men to visit the armory, before they departed. And therein they saw,
placed apart, an hundred and forty stout yew bows of cunning make, with
fine waxen silk strings; and an hundred and forty sheaves of arrows.
Every shaft was a just ell long, set with peacockâ€™s feathers, and
notched with silver. And Sir Richardâ€™s fair lady came forward and with
her own hands gave each yeoman a bow and a sheaf.
NA
 said Sir Richard; â€œbut they carry with them a thousand times their

The Sheriff made good his threat to inform the King. Forth rode he
to London town upon the week following, his scalp wound having healed
sufficiently to permit him to travel. This time he did not seek out
Prince John, but asked audience with King Richard of the Lion Heart
himself. His Majesty had but lately returned from the crusades, and was
just then looking into the state of his kingdom. So the Sheriff found
ready audience.
Then to him the Sheriff spoke at length concerning Robin Hood; how that
for many months the outlaws had defied the King, and slain the Kingâ€™s
deer; how Robin had gathered about him the best archers in all the
countryside; and, finally, how the traitorous knight Sir Richard of the
Lea had rescued the band when capture seemed certain, and refused to
deliver them up to justice.
The King heard him through with attention and quoth he:
â€œMeseems I have heard of this same Robin Hood, and his men, and also
seen somewhat of their prowess. Did not these same outlaws shoot in a

NA
In this speech the Sheriff erred, for the King asked quickly,

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œwe did proclaim an amnesty; but â€˜twas because these men had proved a

NA
treachery would be unknown in the camp of the Saracen; and yet we call

The Sheriff kept silence through very fear and shame; then the King
began speech again:
â€œNathless, my lord Sheriff, we promise to look into this matter. Those
outlaws must be taught that there is but one King in England, and that

So the Sheriff was dismissed, with very mixed feelings, and went his way
home to Nottingham town. A fortnight later the King began to make good
his word, by riding with a small party of knights to Lea Castle. Sir
Richard was advised of the cavalcadeâ€™s approach, and quickly recognized
his royal master in the tall knight who rode in advance. Hasting to open
wide his castle gates he went forth to meet the King and fell on one
knee and kissed his stirrup. For Sir Richard, also, had been with the
King to the Holy Land, and they had gone on many adventurous quests
together.
The King bade him rise, and dismounted from his own horse to greet him
as a brother in arms; and arm-in-arm they went into the castle, while
bugles and trumpets sounded forth joyous welcome in honor of the great
occasion.
After the King had rested and supped, he turned upon the knight and with
grave face inquired:
â€œWhat is this I hear about your castleâ€™s becoming a nest and harbor for
NA
The Sir Richard of the Lea, divining that the Sheriff had been at the
Kingâ€™s ear with his story, made a clean breast of all he knew; how that
the outlaws had befriended him in sore need--as they had befriended
others--and how that he had given them only knightly protection in
return.
The King liked the story well, for his own soul was one of chivalry.
And he asked other questions about Robin Hood, and heard of the ancient
wrong done his father before him, and of Robinâ€™s own enemies, and of his
manner of living.
NA

to sally forth, upon the second day, in quest of me if need were, I

But of this adventure you shall be told in the next tale; for I have
already shown you how Sir Richard of the Lea repaid his debt, with
interest.
CHAPTER XXII
HOW KING RICHARD CAME TO SHERWOOD FOREST
     King Richard hearing of the pranks
     Of Robin Hood and his men,
     He much admired and more desired
     To see both him and them.
     Then Robin takes a can of ale:
     â€œCome let us now begin;
     And every man shall have his can;
NA
Friar Tuck had nursed Little Johnâ€™s wounded knee so skilfully that it
was now healed. In sooth, the last part of the nursing depended more
upon strength than skill; for it consisted chiefly of holding down the
patient, by main force, to his cot. Little John had felt so well that he
had insisted upon getting up before the wound was healed; and he would
have done so, if the friar had not piled some holy books upon his legs
and sat upon his stomach.
Under this vigorous treatment Little John was constrained to lie quiet
until the friar gave him leave to get up. At last he had this leave, and
he and the friar went forth to join the rest of the band, who were right
glad to see them, you may be sure. They sat around a big fire, for â€˜twas
a chilly evening, and they feasted and made merry, in great content.
A cold rain set in, later, but the friar wended his way back, nathless,
to his little hermitage. There he made himself a cheerful blaze, and
changed his dripping robe, and had sat himself down, with a sigh of
satisfaction, before a tankard of hot mulled wine and a pasty, when
suddenly a voice was heard on the outside, demanding admission. His
kennel of dogs set up furious uproar, on the instant, by way of proving
the fact of a strangerâ€™s presence.
NA
unseemly hour? Does he take this for a hostelry? Move on, friend, else
NA
So saying he put the tankard to his lips, when a thundering rap sounded
upon the door-panel, making it to quiver, and causing Tuck almost to
drop his tankard; while an angry voice shouted, â€œHo! Within there! Open,
NA
NA
NA
â€œBut I do not know the road, and if I did I would not budge another
NA
NA
Tuck savagely. Nathless, he was fain to unbar the door in order to
keep it from being battered down. Then lighting a torch at his fire and
whistling for one of his dogs, he strode forth to see who his visitor
might be.
The figure of a tall knight clad in a black coat of mail, with plumed
helmet, stood before him. By his side stood his horse, also caparisoned
in rich armor.
NA
beg of you a bed and a bit of roof, for this night, and fain would

â€œI have no room that even your steed would deign to accept, Sir Knight;

â€œIâ€™ faith, I can smell better fare than that, brother, and must eâ€™en
force my company upon you, though I shall recompense it for gold in the
name of the church. As for my horse, let him but be blanketed and put on

And without further parley the knight boldly strode past Tuck and his
dog and entered the hermitage. Something about his masterful air pleased
Tuck, in spite of his churlishness.

bed and board is yours, this night; but we shall see later who is the

The friar presently returned and drew up a small table near the fire.
NA

NA
The knight did as he was told, and put aside the visor which had hid
his face. He was a bronzed and bearded man with blue eyes, and hair shot
with gold, haughty but handsome withal.
Then once again the priest sat him down to his pasty and mulled wine,
right hopefully. He spoke his grace with some haste, and was surprised
to hear his guest respond fittingly in the Latin tongue. Then they
attacked the wine and pasty valiantly, and the Black Knight made good
his word of being in need of refreshment. Tuck looked ruefully at the
rapidly disappearing food, but came to grudge it not, by reason of the
stories with which his guest enlivened the meal. The wine and warmth of
the room had cheered them both, and they were soon laughing uproariously
as the best of comrades in the world. The Black Knight, it seemed, had
traveled everywhere. He had been on crusades, had fought the courteous
Saladin, had been in prison, and often in peril. But now he spoke of
it lightly, and laughed it off, and made himself so friendly that Friar
Tuck was like to choke with merriment. So passed the time till late; and
the two fell asleep together, one on each side of the table which had
been cleared to the platters.
In the morning Friar Tuck awoke disposed to be surly, but was speedily
mollified by the sight of the Black Knight, who had already risen gay as
a lark, washed his face and hands, and was now stirring a hot gruel over
the fire.
NA
And later as they sat at breakfast, he added, â€œI want not your gold, of
which you spoke last night; but instead I will do what I can to speed
NA
NA
for I have a message to him from the King. All day yesterday I sought

Friar Tuck lifted up his hands in holy horror. â€œI am a lover of peace,

NA
NA
NA
foresaw in this knight a possible gold-bag for Robin. â€œIn sooth, I could
not well live in these woods without hearing somewhat of the outlaws;
NA
NA
So without more ado they went their way into the forest, the knight
riding upon his charger, and Tuck pacing along demurely by his side.
The day had dawned clear and bright, and now with the sun a good three
hours high a sweet autumn fragrance was in the air. The wind had just
that touch of coolness in it which sets the hunterâ€™s blood to tingling;
and every creature of nature seemed bounding with joyous life.
The knight sniffed the fresh air in delight.

warmed toward the courteous stranger.
They had not proceeded more than three or four miles along the way from
Fountain Abbey to Barnesdale, when of a sudden the bushes just ahead of
them parted and a well-knit man with curling brown hair stepped into the
road and laid his hand upon the knightâ€™s bridle.
It was Robin Hood. He had seen Friar Tuck, a little way back, and
shrewdly suspected his plan. Tuck, however, feigned not to know him at
all.

bushes and stood beside him.

Robin took the forty pounds and gravely counted it. One half he gave to
his men and bade them drink the Kingâ€™s health with it. The other half he
handed back to the knight.
NA
NA
NA
NA
So Robin went on the one side of the knightâ€™s steed, and Friar Tuck on
the other, and the men went before and behind till they came to the open
glade before the caves of Barnesdale. Then Robin drew forth his bugle
and winded the three signal blasts of the band. Soon there came a
company of yeomen with its leader, and another, and a third, and a
fourth, till there were sevenscore yeomen in sight. All were dressed
in new livery of Lincoln green, and carried new bows in their hands and
bright short swords at their belts. And every man bent his knee to Robin
Hood ere taking his place before the board, which was already set.
A handsome dark-haired page stood at Robinâ€™s right hand to pour his wine
and that of the knightly guest; while the knight marveled much at all he
saw, and said within himself:
â€œThese men of Robin Hoodâ€™s give him more obedience than my fellows give
NA
At the signal from Robin the dinner began. There was venison and fowl
and fish and wheaten cake and ale and red wine in great plenty, and
â€˜twas a goodly sight to see the smiles upon the hungry yeomenâ€™s faces.
First they listened to an unctuous grace from Friar Tuck, and then Robin
lifted high a tankard of ale.
NA
In honor of our guest who comes with royal word, hereâ€™s a health unto

The guest responded heartily to this toast, and round about the board it
went, the men cheering noisily for King Richard!
After the feast was over, Robin turned to his guest and said, â€œNow you
shall see what life we lead, so that you may report faithfully, for good
NA
So at a signal from him, the men rose up and smartly bent their bows for
practice, while the knight was greatly astonished at the smallness of
the their targets. A wand was set up, far down the glade, and thereon
was balanced a garland of roses. Whosoever failed to speed his shaft
through the garland, without knocking it off the wand, was to submit to
a buffet from the hand of Friar Tuck.

bared his brawny arm ready for service; â€œso you, my friend, are Friar

The knight said no more, though his eyes twinkled; and the shooting
began.
David of Doncaster shot first and landed safely through the rose
garland. Then came Allan-a-Dale and Little John and Stutely and Scarlet
and many of the rest, while the knight held his breath from very
amazement. Each fellow shot truly through the garland, until Middle the
tinker--not to be outdone--stepped up for a trial. But alas! while
he made a fair shot for a townsman, the arrow never came within a
hand-breath of the outer rim of the garland.
NA
NA
Then because Middle made a wry face, as though he had already received
the buffet, and loitered in his steps, Arthur-a-Bland and Will Stutely
seized him by the arms and stood him before the friar. Tuckâ€™s big arm

tinkerâ€™s ear; while Middle himself went rolling over and over on the
grass. He was stopped by a small bush, and up he sat, thrusting his head
through it, rubbing his ear and blinking up at the sky as though the
stars had fallen and struck him. The yeomen roared with merriment, and
as for the knight, he laughed till the tears came out of his blue eyes
and rolled down his face.
After Middleâ€™s mishap, others of the band seemed to lose their balance,
and fared in the same fashion. The garland would topple over in a most
impish way at every breath, although the arrows went through it. So
Middle â€˜gan to feel better when he saw this one and that one tumbling on
the sward.
At last came Robinâ€™s turn. He shot carefully, but as ill luck would have
it the shaft was ill-feathered and swerved sidewise so that it missed
the garland by full three fingers. Then a great roar went up from the
whole company; for â€˜twas rare that they saw their leader miss his mark.
Robin flung his bow upon the ground from very vexation.
NA
NA
Then suddenly seizing his bow again, he sped three shafts as fast as he
could sent them, and every one went clean through the garland.
NA
NA
The band cheered heartily at these last shots; but Will Scarlet came up
gravely to Robin.

Once more the priestâ€™s brawny arm flashed through the air, and struck
NA
from his tracks, though the upper half of his body swerved slightly to
ease the force of the blow. A loud shout burst from the yeomen at this,
for the friarâ€™s fist was proverbial, and few of those present had not
felt the force of it in times past.
NA
gauntlet. And with one blow of his fist the knight sent the friar
spinning to the ground.
If there had been uproar and shouting before, it was as naught to the
noise which now broke forth. Every fellow held his sides or rolled upon
the ground from laughter; every fellow, save one, and that was Robin
Hood.
NA
NA
Robinâ€™s plight did, indeed, seem a sorry one, before the steel muscles
of his stranger. But he was saved from a tumble heels over head by
an unlooked-for diversion. A horn winded in the glade, and a party of
knights were seen approaching.
NA
NA
And so it was. Sir Richard spurred forward his horse and dashed up to
the camp while the outlaws stood at stiff attention. When he had come
near the spot where the Black Knight stood, he dismounted and knelt
before him.
NA
NA

and all his men bent reverently upon their knees, as one man.

have shown yourselves to be, and it were a sad pity to decree such men
to death. England could not produce the like again, for many a day. But,
in sooth, I cannot allow you to roam in the forest and shoot my deer;
nor to take the law of the land into your own hands. Therefore, I now
appoint you to be Royal Archers and mine own especial body-guard. There
be one or two civil matters to settle with certain Norman noblemen,
in which I crave your aid. Thereafter, the half of your number, as
may later be determined, shall come back to these woodlands as Royal
Foresters. Mayhap you will show as much zeal in protecting my preserves
as you have formerly shown in hunting them. Where, now, is that outlaw

Then the King chatted with others of the foresters, and made himself as
one of them for the evening, rejoicing that he could have this careless
freedom of the woods. And Much, the millerâ€™s son, and Arthur-a-Bland,
and Middle, and Stutely and Scarlet and Little John and others played
at the quarter-staff, giving and getting many lusty blows. Then as
the shades of night drew on, the whole company--knights and
foresters--supped and drank around a blazing fire, while Allen sang
sweetly to the thrumming of the harp, and the others joined in the
chorus.
â€˜Twas a happy, care-free night--this last one together under the
greenwood tree. Robin could not help feeling an undertone of sadness
that it was to be the last; for the charm of the woodland was still upon
him. But he knew â€˜twas better so, and that the new life with Marian and
in the service of his King would bring its own joys.
Then the night deepened, the fire sank, but was replenished and the
company lay down to rest. The King, at his own request, spent the night
in the open. Thus they slept--King and subject alike--out under the
stars, cared for lovingly by Nature, kind mother of us all.
In the morning the company was early astir and on their way to
Nottingham. It was a goodly cavalcade. First rode King Richard of the
Lion Heart, with his tall figure set forth by the black armor and waving
plume in his helm. Then came Sir Richard of the Lea with fourscore
knights and men-at-arms. And after them came Robin Hood and Maid Marian
riding upon milk-white steeds. Allan-a-Dale also escorted Mistress Dale
on horseback, for she was to be matron-of-honor at the wedding. These
were followed by sevenscore archers clad in their bravest Lincoln green,
and with their new bows unstrung in token of peace.
Outside the gates of Nottingham town they were halted.
NA
NA
were opened and the bridge let down without delay.
Almost before the company had crossed the moat the news spread through
the town like wildfire.
NA
From every corner flocked the people to see the company pass; and wildly
did they cheer for the King, who rode smilingly with bared head down
through the market-place.
At the far end of it, he was met by the Sheriff who came up puffing in
his haste to do the King honor. He fairly turned green with rage when he
saw Sir Richard of the Lea and Robin Hood in the royal company, but made
low obeisance to his master.
NA
according to my promise. There be none left, for all have now taken
service with their King. And lest there should be further outbreak,
I have determined to place in charge of this shire a man who fears
no other man in it. Master Little John is hereby created Sheriff of

The Sheriff bowed, but dared utter no word. Then the King turned to the

seizures of the lands and certain acts of oppression which ill become a

The Bishop also bowed and departed, glad to escape a severer censure for
the time.
The company then rode on to the Mansion House, where the King held high
levee through all the noon hours, and the whole town made a holiday.
In the afternoon the way from the Mansion House to Nottingham Church was
lined with cheering people, as the wedding party passed by. The famous
bowmen were gazed at as curiously as though they had been wild animals,
but were cheered none the less. Robin who had long been held in secret
liking was now doubly popular since he had the Kingâ€™s favor.
Along the way ahead of the King and the smiling bride and groom to be
ran little maids strewing flowers; while streamers floated in greeting
from the windows. I ween, the only hearts that were not glad this day
were those of the old Sheriff, and of his proud daughter, who peered
between the shutters of her window and was like to eat out her heart
from envy and hatred.
At last the party reached the church, where the King dismounted lightly
from his horse and helped the bride to alight; while Will Scarlet,
the best man, assisted Mistress Dale. Within the church they found
the Bishop robed in state, and by his side Friar Tuck who had been
especially deputed to assist.
The service was said in Latin, while the organ pealed forth softly. The
King gave away the bride, as he had said, and afterwards claimed first
kiss for his pains. Then the happy party dispersed, and Robin and Marian
passed out again through the portal, man and wife.
Out through the cheering streets they fared, while the greenwood men ran
ahead and flung gold pennies right and left in their joy, and bade the
people drink the health of the young couple and the King. Then the
whole party took horse at Will Scarletâ€™s earnest wish, and went down to
Gamewell Lodge, where the old Squire George wept for joy at seeing his
son and the King and the wedding--party. That night they spent there,
and feasted, and the next day, Sir Richard of the Lea claimed them.
And thus, amid feasting and rejoicing and kingly favor, Robin Hood, the
new Earl of Huntingdon, and his bride began their wedded life.
CHAPTER XXIV
HOW ROBIN HOOD MET HIS DEATH
     â€œGive me my bent bow in my hand,
     And a broad arrow Iâ€™ll let flee;
     And where this arrow is taken up,

Now by good rights this story should end with the wedding of Robin Hood
and Maid Marian; for do not many pleasant tales end with a wedding and
NA
But this is a true account--in so far as we can find the quaint old
ballads which tell of it--and so we must follow one more of these songs
and learn how Robin, after living many years longer, at last came to
seek his grave. And the story of it runs in this wise.
Robin Hood and his men, now the Royal Archers, went with King Richard of
the Lion Heart through England settling certain private disputes which
had arisen among the Norman barons while the King was gone to the Holy
Land. Then the King proceeded amid great pomp and rejoicing to the
palace at London, and Robin, the new Earl of Huntingdon, brought his
Countess thither, where she became one of the finest ladies of the
Court.
The Royal Archers were now divided into two bands, and one-half of them
were retained in London, while the other half returned to Sherwood and
Barnesdale, there to guard the Kingâ€™s preserves.
Several months passed by, and Robin began to chafe under the restraint
of city life. He longed for the fresh pure air of the greenwood, and
the rollicking society of his yeomen. One day, upon seeing some lads
at archery practice upon a green, he could not help but lament, saying,
â€œWoe is me! I fear my hand is fast losing its old time cunning at the
NA
Finally he became so distraught that he asked leave to travel in foreign
lands, and this was granted him. He took Maid Marian with him, and
together they went through many strange countries. Finally in an Eastern
land a great grief came upon Robin. Marian sickened of a plague and
died. They had been married but five years, and Robin felt as though all
the light had gone out of his life.
He wandered about the world for a few months longer, trying to forget
his grief, then came back to the court, at London, and sought some
commission in active service. But unluckily, Richard was gone again upon
his adventures, and Prince John, who acted as Regent, had never been
fond of Robin. He received him with a sarcastic smile.
NA
the Kingâ€™s deer. Belike, then, the King will make you Prime Minister, at
NA
The taunt fired Robinâ€™s blood. He had been in a morose mood, ever since
his dear wifeâ€™s death. He answered Prince John hotly, and the Prince
bade his guards seize him and cast him into the Tower.
After lying there for a few weeks, he was released by the faithful
Stutely and the remnant of the Royal Archers, and all together they fled
the city and made their way to the greenwood. There Robin blew the old
familiar call, which all had known and loved so well. Up came running
the remainder of the band, who had been Royal Foresters, and when they
saw their old master they embraced his knees and kissed his hands, and
fairly cried for joy that he had come again to them. And one and all
forswore fealty to Prince John, and lived quietly with Robin in the
greenwood, doing harm to none and only awaiting the time when King
Richard should come again.
But King Richard came not again, and would never need his Royal Guard
more. Tidings presently reached them, of how he had met his death in a
foreign land, and how John reigned as King in his stead. The proof of
these events followed soon after, when there came striding through the
glade the big, familiar form of Little John.
NA
embraced his old comrade.
NA
Little John. â€œThe new King has deposed me, and â€˜tis greatly to
my liking, for I have long desired to join you here again in the
NA
Then were the rest of the band right glad at this news, and toasted
Little John royally.
The new King waged fierce war upon the outlaws, soon after this, and
sent so many scouting parties into Sherwood and Barnesdale that Robin
and his men left these woods for a time and went into Derbyshire, near
Haddon Hall. A curious pile of stone is shown to this day as the ruins
of Robinâ€™s Castle, where the bold outlaw is believed to have defied his
enemies for a year or more. At any rate King John found so many troubles
of his own, after a time, that he ceased troubling the outlaws.
But in one of the last sorties Robin was wounded. The cut did not seem
serious, and healed over the top; but it left a lurking fever. Daily his
strength ebbed away from him, until he was in sore distress.
One day as he rode along on horseback, near Kirklees Abbey, he was
seized with so violent a rush of blood to the head that he reeled and
came near falling from his saddle. He dismounted weakly and knocked at
the Abbey gate. A woman shrouded in black peered forth.
NA
 she said.
NA
NA
At the name of Robin Hood the woman started back, and then, as though
bethinking herself, unbarred the door and admitted him. Assisting his
fainting frame up a flight of stairs and into a front room, she loosed
his collar and bathed his face until he was revived. Then she spoke
hurriedly in a low voice:
â€œYour fever will sink, if you are bled. See, I have provided a lancet
NA
So she bled him, and he fell into a stupor which lasted nearly all that
day, so that he awoke weak and exhausted from loss of blood.
Now there is a dispute as to this abbess who bled him. Some say that
she did it in all kindness of heart; while others aver that she was none
other than the former Sheriffâ€™s daughter, and found her revenge at last
in this cruel deed.
Be that as it may, Robinâ€™s eyes swam from very weakness when he awoke.
He called wearily for help, but there was no response. He looked
longingly through the window at the green of the forest; but he was too
weak to make the leap that would be needed to reach the ground.
     He then bethought him of his horn,
     Which hung down at his knee;
     He set his horn unto his mouth,
     And blew out weak blasts three.
Little John was out in the forest near by, or the blasts would never
have been heard. At their sound he sprang to his feet.
NA
NA
So he made haste and came running up to the door of the abbey, and
knocked loudly for admittance. Failing to get reply, he burst in the
door with frenzied blows of his mighty fist, and soon came running up
NA
Little John in great distress; â€œI fear you have met with treachery! If

He closed his eyes and fell back, so that his friend thought him dying.
The great tears fell from the giantâ€™s eyes and wet his masterâ€™s hand.
Robin slowly rallied and seized his comradeâ€™s outstretched arm.

And with one last mighty effort he sped his shaft out of the open
window, straight and true, as in the days of old, till it struck the
largest oak of them all and dropped in the shadow of the trees. Then he
fell back upon the sobbing breast of his devoted friend.
NA

He rested a moment, and Little John scarce knew that he was alive. But
on a sudden Robinâ€™s eye brightened, and he seemed to think himself back
once more with the band in the open forest glade. He struggled to rise.
â€œHa! â€˜tis a fine stag, Will! And Allan, thou never didst thrum the harp
more sweetly. How the light blazes! And Marian!--â€˜tis my Marian--come at
NA
So died the body of Robin Hood; but his spirit lives on through the
centuries in the deathless ballads which are sung of him, and in the
hearts of men who love freedom and chivalry.
They buried him where his last arrow had fallen, and they set a stone to
mark the spot. And on the stone were graven these words:
     â€œHere underneath his little stone
     Lies Robert, Earl of Huntingdon;
     Never archer as he so good,
     And people called him Robin Hood.
     Such outlaws as he and his men
