LOUISE DE LA VALLIERE
by Alexandre Dumas, Pere
Transcriberâ€™s Notes:
As you may be aware, Project Gutenberg has been involved with the
writings of both the Alexandre Dumases for some time now, and since we
get a few questions about the order in which the books should be read,
and in which they were published, these following comments should
hopefully help most of our readers.
***
The Vicomte de Bragelonne is the final volume of Dâ€™Artagnan Romances:
it is usually split into three or four parts, and the final portion
is entitled The Man in the Iron Mask. The Man in the Iron Mask weâ€™re
familiar with today is the last volume of the four-volume edition.
[Not all the editions split them in the same manner, hence some of the
confusion...but wait...thereâ€™s yet more reason for confusion.]
We intend to do ALL of The Vicomte de Bragelonne, split into four
etexts entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later, Louise de la
Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask; you WILL be getting The Man in
the Iron Mask.
One thing that may be causing confusion is that the etext we have now,
entitled Ten Years Later, says itâ€™s the sequel to The Three Musketeers.
While this is technically true, thereâ€™s another book, Twenty Years
After, that comes between. The confusion is generated by the two facts
that we published Ten Years Later BEFORE we published Twenty Years
After, and that many people see those titles as meaning Ten and Twenty
NA
NA
the Twenty Years later.. .as per history. Also, the third book of the
Dâ€™Artagnan Romances, while entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, has the
subtitle Ten Years Later. These two titles are also given to different
volumes: The Vicomte de Bragelonne can refer to the whole book, or the
first volume of the three or four-volume editions. Ten Years Later
can, similarly, refer to the whole book, or the second volume of the
four-volume edition. To add to the confusion, in the case of our etexts,
it refers to the first 104 chapters of the whole book, covering material
in the first and second etexts in the new series. Here is a guide to the
series which may prove helpful:
The Three Musketeers: Etext 1257--First book of the Dâ€™Artagnan Romances.
Covers the years 1625-1628.
Twenty Years After: Etext 1259--Second book of the Dâ€™Artagnan Romances.
Covers the years 1648-1649. [Third in the order that we published, but
second in time sequence!!!]
Ten Years Later: Etext 1258--First 104 chapters of the third book of the
Dâ€™Artagnan Romances. Covers the years 1660-1661.
The Vicomte de Bragelonne: Etext 2609 (first in the new series)--First
75 chapters of the third book of the Dâ€™Artagnan Romances. Covers the
year 1660.
Ten Years Later: Etext 2681 (second in the new series)--Chapters
76-140 of that third book of the Dâ€™Artagnan Romances. Covers the years
1660-1661. [In this particular editing of it]
Louise de la Valliere: Etext 2710 (our new text)--Chapters 141-208 of
the third book of the Dâ€™Artagnan Romances. Covers the year 1661.
The Man in the Iron Mask: forthcoming (our next text)--Chapters
209-269 of the third book of the Dâ€™Artagnan Romances. Covers the years
1661-1673.
If weâ€™ve calculated correctly, that fourth text SHOULD correspond to
the modern editions of The Man in the Iron Mask, which is still
widely circulated, and comprises about the last 1/4 of The Vicomte de
Bragelonne.

Introduction: In the months of March-July in 1844, in the magazine Le
Siecle, the first portion of a story appeared, penned by the celebrated
playwright Alexandre Dumas. It was based, he claimed, on some
manuscripts he had found a year earlier in the Bibliotheque Nationale
while researching a history he planned to write on Louis XIV. They
chronicled the adventures of a young man named Dâ€™Artagnan who, upon
entering Paris, became almost immediately embroiled in court intrigues,
international politics, and ill-fated affairs between royal lovers. Over
the next six years, readers would enjoy the adventures of this youth and
his three famous friends, Porthos, Athos, and Aramis, as their exploits
unraveled behind the scenes of some of the most momentous events in
French and even English history.
Eventually these serialized adventures were published in novel form,
and became the three Dâ€™Artagnan Romances known today. Here is a brief
summary of the first two novels:
The Three Musketeers (serialized March--July, 1844): The year is 1625.
The young Dâ€™Artagnan arrives in Paris at the tender age of 18, and
almost immediately offends three musketeers, Porthos, Aramis, and Athos.
Instead of dueling, the four are attacked by five of the Cardinalâ€™s
guards, and the courage of the youth is made apparent during the battle.
The four become fast friends, and, when asked by Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s landlord
to find his missing wife, embark upon an adventure that takes them
across both France and England in order to thwart the plans of the
Cardinal Richelieu. Along the way, they encounter a beautiful young spy,
named simply Milady, who will stop at nothing to disgrace Queen Anne of
Austria before her husband, Louis XIII, and take her revenge upon the
four friends.
Twenty Years After (serialized January--August, 1845): The year is now
1648, twenty years since the close of the last story. Louis XIII has
died, as has Cardinal Richelieu, and while the crown of France may sit
upon the head of Anne of Austria as Regent for the young Louis XIV,
the real power resides with the Cardinal Mazarin, her secret husband.
Dâ€™Artagnan is now a lieutenant of musketeers, and his three friends have
retired to private life. Athos turned out to be a nobleman, the Comte de
la Fere, and has retired to his home with his son, Raoul de Bragelonne.
Aramis, whose real name is Dâ€™Herblay, has followed his intention of
shedding the musketeerâ€™s cassock for the priestâ€™s robes, and Porthos has
married a wealthy woman, who left him her fortune upon her death. But
trouble is stirring in both France and England. Cromwell menaces the
institution of royalty itself while marching against Charles I, and at
home the Fronde is threatening to tear France apart. Dâ€™Artagnan brings
his friends out of retirement to save the threatened English monarch,
but Mordaunt, the son of Milady, who seeks to avenge his motherâ€™s death
at the musketeersâ€™ hands, thwarts their valiant efforts. Undaunted, our
heroes return to France just in time to help save the young Louis XIV,
quiet the Fronde, and tweak the nose of Cardinal Mazarin.
The third novel, The Vicomte de Bragelonne (serialized October,
1847--January, 1850), has enjoyed a strange history in its English
translation. It has been split into three, four, or five volumes at
various points in its history. The five-volume edition generally does
not give titles to the smaller portions, but the others do. In the
three-volume edition, the novels are entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne,
Louise de la Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask. For the purposes of
this etext, I have chosen to split the novel as the four-volume edition
does, with these titles: The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later,
Louise de la Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask. In the first two
etexts:
The Vicomte de Bragelonne (Etext 2609): It is the year 1660, and
Dâ€™Artagnan, after thirty-five years of loyal service, has become
disgusted with serving King Louis XIV while the real power resides with
the Cardinal Mazarin, and has tendered his resignation. He embarks on
his own project, that of restoring Charles II to the throne of England,
and, with the help of Athos, succeeds, earning himself quite a fortune
in the process. Dâ€™Artagnan returns to Paris to live the life of a rich
citizen, and Athos, after negotiating the marriage of Philip, the kingâ€™s
brother, to Princess Henrietta of England, likewise retires to his own
estate, La Fere. Meanwhile, Mazarin has finally died, and left Louis to
assume the reigns of power, with the assistance of M. Colbert, formerly
Mazarinâ€™s trusted clerk. Colbert has an intense hatred for M. Fouquet,
the kingâ€™s superintendent of finances, and has resolved to use any
means necessary to bring about his fall. With the new rank of intendant
bestowed on him by Louis, Colbert succeeds in having two of Fouquetâ€™s
loyal friends tried and executed. He then brings to the kingâ€™s attention
that Fouquet is fortifying the island of Belle-Ile-en-Mer, and could
possibly be planning to use it as a base for some military operation
against the king. Louis calls Dâ€™Artagnan out of retirement and sends
him to investigate the island, promising him a tremendous salary and his
long-promised promotion to captain of the musketeers upon his return. At
Belle-Isle, Dâ€™Artagnan discovers that the engineer of the fortifications
is, in fact, Porthos, now the Baron du Vallon, and thatâ€™s not all.
The blueprints for the island, although in Porthosâ€™s handwriting,
show evidence of another script that has been erased, that of Aramis.
Dâ€™Artagnan later discovers that Aramis has become the bishop of Vannes,
which is, coincidentally, a parish belonging to M. Fouquet. Suspecting
that Dâ€™Artagnan has arrived on the kingâ€™s behalf to investigate, Aramis
tricks Dâ€™Artagnan into wandering around Vannes in search of Porthos,
and sends Porthos on an heroic ride back to Paris to warn Fouquet of
the danger. Fouquet rushes to the king, and gives him Belle-Isle as a
present, thus allaying any suspicion, and at the same time humiliating
Colbert, just minutes before the usher announces someone else seeking an
audience with the king.
Ten Years Later (Etext 2681): As 1661 approaches, Princess Henrietta of
England arrives for her marriage, and throws the court of France into
complete disorder. The jealousy of the Duke of Buckingham, who is
in love with her, nearly occasions a war on the streets of Le Havre,
thankfully prevented by Raoulâ€™s timely and tactful intervention. After
the marriage, though, Monsieur Philip becomes horribly jealous of
Buckingham, and has him exiled. Before leaving, however, the duke
fights a duel with M. de Wardes at Calais. De Wardes is a malicious and
spiteful man, the sworn enemy of Dâ€™Artagnan, and, by the same token,
that of Athos, Aramis, Porthos, and Raoul as well. Both men are
seriously wounded, and the duke is taken back to England to recover.
Raoulâ€™s friend, the Comte de Guiche, is the next to succumb to
Henriettaâ€™s charms, and Monsieur obtains his exile as well, though De
Guiche soon effects a reconciliation. But then the kingâ€™s eye falls on
Madame Henrietta during the comteâ€™s absence, and this time Monsieurâ€™s
jealousy has no recourse. Anne of Austria intervenes, and the king and
his sister-in-law decide to pick a young lady with whom the king
can pretend to be in love, the better to mask their own affair. They
unfortunately select Louise de la Valliere, Raoulâ€™s fiancee. While the
court is in residence at Fontainebleau, the king unwitting overhears
Louise confessing her love for him while chatting with her friends
beneath the royal oak, and the king promptly forgets his affection for
Madame. That same night, Henrietta overhears, at the same oak, De
Guiche confessing his love for her to Raoul. The two embark on their
own affair. A few days later, during a rainstorm, Louis and Louise
are trapped alone together, and the whole court begins to talk of the
scandal while their love affair blossoms. Aware of Louiseâ€™s attachment,
the king arranges for Raoul to be sent to England for an indefinite
period.
Meanwhile, the struggle for power continues between Fouquet and Colbert.
Although the Belle-Isle plot backfired, Colbert prompts the king to ask
Fouquet for more and more money, and without his two friends to raise it
for him, Fouquet is sorely pressed. The situation gets so bad that his
new mistress, Madame de Belliere, must resort to selling all her jewels
and her gold and silver plate. Aramis, while this is going on, has grown
friendly with the governor of the Bastile, M. de Baisemeaux, a fact that
Baisemeaux unwittingly reveals to Dâ€™Artagnan while inquiring of him
as to Aramisâ€™s whereabouts. This further arouses the suspicions of the
musketeer, who was made to look ridiculous by Aramis. He had ridden
overnight at an insane pace, but arrived a few minutes after Fouquet
had already presented Belle-Isle to the king. Aramis learns from the
governor the location of a mysterious prisoner, who bears a remarkable
resemblance to Louis XIV--in fact, the two are identical. He uses
the existence of this secret to persuade a dying Franciscan monk, the
general of the society of the Jesuits, to name him, Aramis, the new
general of the order. On Aramisâ€™s advice, hoping to use Louiseâ€™s
influence with the king to counteract Colbertâ€™s influence, Fouquet also
writes a love letter to La Valliere, unfortunately undated. It never
reaches its destination, however, as the servant ordered to deliver it
turns out to be an agent of Colbertâ€™s.
Porthos, in the meantime, has been recovering from his midnight ride
from Belle-Isle at Fouquetâ€™s residence at Saint-Mande. Athos has
retired, once again to La Fere. Dâ€™Artagnan, little amused by the courtâ€™s
activities at Fontainebleau, and finding himself with nothing to do, has
returned to Paris, and we find him again in Planchetâ€™s grocery shop.
And so, the story continues in this, the third etext of The Vicomte de
Bragelonne. Enjoy!
John Bursey
Chapter I. Malaga.
During all these long and noisy debates between the opposite ambitions
of politics and love, one of our characters, perhaps the one least
deserving of neglect, was, however, very much neglected, very much
forgotten, and exceedingly unhappy. In fact, Dâ€™Artagnan--Dâ€™Artagnan,
we say, for we must call him by his name, to remind our readers of his
existence--Dâ€™Artagnan, we repeat, had absolutely nothing whatever to do,
amidst these brilliant butterflies of fashion. After following the king
during two whole days at Fontainebleau, and critically observing
the various pastoral fancies and heroi-comic transformations of his
sovereign, the musketeer felt that he needed something more than this to
satisfy the cravings of his nature. At every moment assailed by
people asking him, â€œHow do you think this costume suits me, Monsieur
NA
I think you are quite as well-dressed as the best-dressed monkey to
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan would choose where he did not feel disposed to pay any other:
and, whether agreeable or not, the inquirer was obliged to be satisfied
with it. Whenever any one asked him, â€œHow do you intend to dress
NA
the ladies all laughed, and a few of them blushed. But after a couple
of days passed in this manner, the musketeer, perceiving that nothing
serious was likely to arise which would concern him, and that the king
had completely, or, at least, appeared to have completely forgotten
Paris, Saint-Mande, and Belle-Isle--that M. Colbertâ€™s mind was occupied
with illuminations and fireworks--that for the next month, at least,
the ladies had plenty of glances to bestow, and also to receive in
exchange--Dâ€™Artagnan asked the king for leave of absence for a matter of
private business. At the moment Dâ€™Artagnan made his request, his majesty
was on the point of going to bed, quite exhausted from dancing.
NA
air of astonishment; for Louis XIV. could never understand why any one
who had the distinguished honor of being near him could wish to leave
him.
NA
slightest service to you in anything. Ah! if I could only hold the
balancing-pole while you were dancing, it would be a very different
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes; but I always thought dancers went from easy to difficult acrobatic
feats. I was mistaken; all the more greater reason, therefore, that I
should leave for a time. Sire, I repeat, you have no present occasion
for my services; besides, if your majesty should have any need of me,
NA
NA
We shall not look for Dâ€™Artagnan, therefore, at Fontainebleau, for to do
so would be useless; but, with the permission of our readers, follow him
to the Rue des Lombards, where he was located at the sign of the Pilon
dâ€™Or, in the house of our old friend Planchet. It was about eight
oâ€™clock in the evening, and the weather was exceedingly warm; there
was only one window open, and that one belonging to a room on the
_entresol_. A perfume of spices, mingled with another perfume less
exotic, but more penetrating, namely, that which arose from the street,
ascended to salute the nostrils of the musketeer. Dâ€™Artagnan, reclining
in an immense straight-backed chair, with his legs not stretched out,
but simply placed upon a stool, formed an angle of the most obtuse form
that could possibly be seen. Both his arms were crossed over his head,
his head reclining upon his left shoulder, like Alexander the Great.
His eyes, usually so quick and intelligent in their expression, were
now half-closed, and seemed fastened, as it were, upon a small corner of
blue sky that was visible behind the opening of the chimneys; there was
just enough blue, and no more, to fill one of the sacks of lentils, or
haricots, which formed the principal furniture of the shop on the
ground floor. Thus extended at his ease, and sheltered in his place of
observation behind the window, Dâ€™Artagnan seemed as if he had ceased
to be a soldier, as if he were no longer an officer belonging to the
palace, but was, on the contrary, a quiet, easy-going citizen in a state
of stagnation between his dinner and supper, or between his supper and
his bed; one of those strong, ossified brains, which have no more room
for a single idea, so fiercely does animal matter keep watch at the
doors of intelligence, narrowly inspecting the contraband trade which
might result from the introduction into the brain of a symptom of
thought. We have already said night was closing in, the shops were being
lighted, while the windows of the upper apartments were being closed,
and the rhythmic steps of a patrol of soldiers forming the night watch
could be heard retreating. Dâ€™Artagnan continued, however, to think
of nothing, except the blue corner of the sky. A few paces from him,
completely in the shade, lying on his stomach, upon a sack of Indian
corn, was Planchet, with both his arms under his chin, and his eyes
fixed on Dâ€™Artagnan, who was either thinking, dreaming, or sleeping,
with his eyes open. Planchet had been watching him for a tolerably long
NA
 But Dâ€™Artagnan did not stir. Planchet then saw that it was necessary
to have recourse to more effectual means still: after a prolonged
reflection on the subject, the most ingenious means that suggested
itself to him under the present circumstances, was to let himself roll
off the sack on to the floor, murmuring, at the same time, against
NA
by Planchetâ€™s fall, Dâ€™Artagnan, who had in the course of his existence
heard many other, and very different falls, did not appear to pay the
least attention to the present one. Besides, an enormous cart, laden
with stones, passing from the Rue Saint-Mederic, absorbed, in the noise
of its wheels, the noise of Planchetâ€™s tumble. And yet Planchet fancied
that, in token of tacit approval, he saw him imperceptibly smile at the
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œIf you say that you are not _even_ asleep, it is as much as to say that
you have not even the consolation of being able to sleep; or, better
still, it is precisely the same as telling me that you are getting bored
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œMonsieur dâ€™Artagnan, it is a week since you returned here from
Fontainebleau; in other words, you have no longer your orders to issue,
or your men to review and maneuver. You need the sound of guns, drums,
and all that din and confusion; I, who have myself carried a musket, can

NA
NA
NA
â€œMy dear Planchet, there was, once upon a time, at the siege of La
Rochelle, when I was there, when you were there, when we both were
there, a certain Arab, who was celebrated for the manner in which he
adjusted culverins. He was a clever fellow, although of a very odd
complexion, which was the same color as your olives. Well, this Arab,
whenever he had done eating or working, used to sit down to rest
himself, as I am resting myself now, and smoked I cannot tell you
what sort of magical leaves, in a large amber-mouthed tube; and if any
officers, happening to pass, reproached him for being always asleep, he
used quietly to reply: â€˜Better to sit down than to stand up, to lie
down than to sit down, to be dead than to lie down.â€™ He was an acutely
melancholy Arab, and I remember him perfectly well, form the color of
his skin, and the style of his conversation. He used to cut off the

â€œPrecisely; and then used to embalm them, when they were worth the
trouble; and when he was thus engaged with his herbs and plants about

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, monsieur, in point of fact, then, â€˜better to sit down than to
NA
Planchet smiled in a roguish way; â€œas for â€˜better to be lying down,â€™
let that pass, but as for the last proposition, that it is â€˜better to
be dead than alive,â€™ it is, in my opinion, very absurd, my own undoubted
preference being for my bed; and if you are not of my opinion, it is
simply, as I have already had the honor of telling you, because you are
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes; your house is dull enough to drive people to think; you will admit
NA
NA
NA
â€œBut it is no less true, monsieur, that, if you were living at the back
of the house, you would bore yourself--I mean, you would think--more
NA
NA
NA
NA
little laugh which was not without its meaning.
NA
NA
â€œIs there no other king to be restored, M. dâ€™Artagnan--no second Monk to
NA
â€œNo, my dear Planchet; all the kings are seated on their respective
thrones; less comfortably so, perhaps, than I am upon this chair; but,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, you are anxious; and you are getting thin, visibly getting thin.
_Malaga!_ if you go on getting thin, in this way, I will take my sword
NA
NA
NA
â€œJust as you please. Get angry if you like, or call me names, if you
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan had, during this second outburst of Planchetâ€™s, so placed
himself as not to lose a single look of his face; that is, he sat with
both his hands resting on both his knees, and his head stretched out
NA
how you could possibly utter such a blasphemy. M. dâ€™Herblay, your old
master, my friend, an ecclesiastic, a musketeer turned bishop--do you
NA
â€œI could raise my sword against my own father, when I see you in such a
NA
NA
â€œItâ€™s all the same to me whether heâ€™s a gentleman or not. He gives you
the blue devils, that is all I know. And the blue devils make people
get thin. _Malaga!_ I have no notion of M. dâ€™Artagnan leaving my house
NA
â€œHow does he give me the blue devils, as you call it? Come, explain,
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, you; and in your nightmare you called out, several times, â€˜Aramis,
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, what else? You know the saying, Planchet, â€˜dreams go by
NA
â€œNot so; for every time, during the last three days, when you went out,
you have not once failed to ask me, on your return, â€˜Have you seen
M. dâ€™Herblay?â€™ or else â€˜Have you received any letters for me from M.
NA
NA
 said Dâ€™Artagnan.
NA
NA
â€œVery well, monsieur, I accept it; for I know that when you give your
NA
â€œI will not dream of Aramis any more; and I will never ask you again
if there are any letters from M. dâ€™Herblay; but on condition that you
NA
NA
â€œI am a great observer; and just now you made use of a very singular

NA
NA
NA
â€œVery proper, too; it is the name of a dried grape, or raisin, I
NA
â€œIt is my most ferocious oath; when I have once said _Malaga!_ I am a

NA

Planchet; and, as he pronounced these words, he winked his eye with a
cunning expression, which thoroughly awakened Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s attention.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI mean in boring myself to death. We have but a very short time to
NA
NA
â€œWhy not? My hand is still as steady as ever; I can write, and can weigh
out my sugar and spices; my foot is firm; I can dance and walk about; my
stomach has its teeth still, for I eat and digest very well; my heart is
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan crossed one leg over the other, and said, â€œPlanchet, my
friend, I am unnerved with extreme surprise; for you are revealing
NA
Planchet, flattered in the highest degree by this remark, continued to
NA
NA
NA
NA
Planchet, â€œthat, without enjoyment, there is no happiness on this
NA
NA
â€œAt all events, if we cannot obtain pleasure--for pleasure is not so
common a thing, after all--let us, at least, get consolations of some

NA
NA
NA
â€œI put on a buckler for the purpose of confronting _ennui_. I place my
time at the direction of patience; and on the very eve of feeling I am

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI say, that your philosophy is not to be matched in the Christian or
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI could not wish for anything better; but all minds are not of the same
stamp; and it might possibly happen that if I were required to amuse
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œMy dear Planchet, you must understand that when people see each other
every day, and one of the two absents himself, the other misses him. Do
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAnd when I returned, how did you think I looked, as far as my face was
NA
NA
â€œYou admit, you say, that I always look satisfied. And what have you
NA
â€œThat your business was going on very well; that your purchases of rice,
prunes, raw sugar, dried apples, pears, and treacle were advantageous.
You were always very picturesque in your notions and ideas, Planchet;
and I was not in the slightest degree surprised to find you had selected
grocery as an occupation, which is of all trades the most varied, and
the very pleasantest, as far as the character is concerned; inasmuch as
NA
NA
NA
â€œIn thinking that I leave here every fortnight, to collect my money or
to make purchases. Ho, ho! how could you possibly have thought such
NA
inspired Dâ€™Artagnan with very serious misgivings as to his sanity.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œIt must be true, since you say it; but pray, be assured that it in no
NA
NA
â€œNo; you are a man of genius; and whenever the question happens to be
of war, tactics, surprises, or good honest blows to be dealt with, why,
kings are marionettes, compared to you. But for the consolations of the
mind, the proper care of the body, the agreeable things of like, if one
may say so--ah! monsieur, donâ€™t talk to me about men of genius; they are
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI was not bored; yet since you have been talking to me, I feel more
NA
â€œVery good, then; that is not a bad beginning. I will cure you, rely
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œOh, there is no occasion for so many as that, two will be quite
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou will admit, however, that it is important I should know where I am
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œVery well; I am going to take you to a place, half town and half
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes; and more wonderful still, to a place from which you have just

NA
NA
NA
Planchet answered Dâ€™Artagnan by a wink full of sly humor.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œLet us say to-morrow, if you like; and then, besides, to-morrow is the
14th, that is to say, the day before the one when I am afraid of getting

NA
NA
NA
â€œNo; I prefer the gentlest of all; I never was a very good rider, as
you know, and in my grocery business I have got more awkward than ever;

NA

Planchet. And thereupon he rose from his sack of Indian corn, stretching
himself, and making all his bones crack, one after the other, with a
sort of harmony.
NA
no sybarite upon the face of the globe who can for a moment be compared
to you. Oh, Planchet, it is very clear that we have never yet eaten a

Chapter II. A Letter from M. Baisemeaux.
Dâ€™Artagnan, faithful to his plan, went the very next morning to pay
a visit to M. de Baisemeaux. It was cleaning up or tidying day at the
Bastile; the cannons were furbished up, the staircases scraped and
cleaned; and the jailers seemed to be carefully engaged in polishing
the very keys. As for the soldiers belonging to the garrison, they were
walking about in different courtyards, under the pretense that they were
clean enough. The governor, Baisemeaux, received Dâ€™Artagnan with more
than ordinary politeness, but he behaved towards him with so marked a
reserve of manner, that all Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s tact and cleverness could not
get a syllable out of him. The more he kept himself within bounds,
the more Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s suspicion increased. The latter even fancied he
remarked that the governor was acting under the influence of a recent
recommendation. Baisemeaux had not been at the Palais Royal with
Dâ€™Artagnan the same cold and impenetrable man which the latter now found
in the Baisemeaux of the Bastile. When Dâ€™Artagnan wished to make him
talk about the urgent money matters which had brought Baisemeaux in
search of Dâ€™Artagnan, and had rendered him expansive, notwithstanding
what had passed on that evening, Baisemeaux pretended that he had some
orders to give in the prison, and left Dâ€™Artagnan so long alone waiting
for him, that our musketeer, feeling sure that he should not get another
syllable out of him, left the Bastile without waiting until Baisemeaux
returned from his inspection. But Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s suspicions were aroused,
and when once that was the case, Dâ€™Artagnan could not sleep or remain
quiet for a moment. He was among men what the cat is among quadrupeds,
the emblem of anxiety and impatience, at the same moment. A restless cat
can no more remain the same place than a silk thread wafted idly to and
fro with every breath of air. A cat on the watch is as motionless as
death stationed at its place of observation, and neither hunger nor
thirst can draw it from its meditations. Dâ€™Artagnan, who was burning
with impatience, suddenly threw aside the feeling, like a cloak which
he felt too heavy on his shoulders, and said to himself that that which
they were concealing from him was the very thing it was important he
should know; and, consequently, he reasoned that Baisemeaux would not
fail to put Aramis on his guard, if Aramis had given him any particular
recommendation, and this was, in fact, the very thing that happened.
Baisemeaux had hardly had time to return from the donjon, than
Dâ€™Artagnan placed himself in ambuscade close to the Rue de Petit-Musc,
so as to see every one who might leave the gates of the Bastile. After
NA
the pent-house of which he could keep himself a little in the shade,
Dâ€™Artagnan observed a soldier leave the Bastile. This was, indeed, the
surest indication he could possibly have wished for, as every jailer
or warder has certain days, and even certain hours, for leaving the
Bastile, since all are alike prohibited from having either wives or
lodgings in the castle, and can accordingly leave without exciting any
curiosity; but a soldier once in barracks is kept there for four and
twenty hours when on duty,--and no one knew this better than Dâ€™Artagnan.
The guardsman in question, therefore, was not likely to leave his
regimentals, except on an express and urgent order. The soldier, we
were saying, left the Bastile at a slow and lounging pace, like a happy
mortal, in fact, who, instead of mounting sentry before a wearisome
guard-house, or upon a bastion no less wearisome, has the good luck
to get a little liberty, in addition to a walk--both pleasures being
luckily reckoned as part of his time on duty. He bent his steps towards
the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, enjoying the fresh air and the warmth of the
sun, and looking at all the pretty faces he passed. Dâ€™Artagnan followed
him at a distance; he had not yet arranged his ideas as what was to be

NA
very difficult, by the by, soon got in advance of the soldier. Not only
did he observe that his face showed a tolerable amount of intelligence
and resolution, but he noticed also that his nose was a little red. â€œHe

get hold of the letter. But a common soldier would, of course, be only
too delighted at having been selected by M. de Baisemeaux as a special
messenger, and would not be likely to sell his message. As Dâ€™Artagnan

first his nails, and then his mustaches, he perceived a group of archers
and a commissary of the police engaged in carrying away a man of very
gentlemanly exterior, who was struggling with all his might against
them. The archers had torn his clothes, and were dragging him roughly
away. He begged they would lead him along more respectfully, asserting
that he was a gentleman and a soldier. And observing our soldier walking

The soldier walked on with the same step towards the man who had
called out to him, followed by the crowd. An idea suddenly occurred to
Dâ€™Artagnan; it was his first one, and we shall find it was not a bad one
either. During the time the gentleman was relating to the soldier that
he had just been seized in a house as a thief, when the truth was he
was only there as a lover; and while the soldier was pitying him, and
offering him consolation and advice with that gravity which a French
soldier has always ready whenever his vanity or his _esprit de corps_ is
concerned, Dâ€™Artagnan glided behind the soldier, who was closely hemmed
in by the crowd, and with a rapid sweep, like a sabre slash, snatched
the letter from his belt. As at this moment the gentleman with the torn
clothes was pulling about the soldier, to show how the commissary of
police had pulled him about, Dâ€™Artagnan effected his pillage of the
letter without the slightest interference. He stationed himself about
ten paces distant, behind the pillar of an adjoining house, and read
on the address, â€œTo Monsieur du Vallon, at Monsieur Fouquetâ€™s,

drew out the paper, which was folded in four, from the inside; which
contained only these words:

inquiries.

perceived that the commissary and the archers had succeeded in
convincing the soldier, and went on their way with the prisoner,
the latter being still surrounded by the crowd, and continuing his
complaints. Dâ€™Artagnan advanced into the very middle of the crowd, let
the letter fall, without any one having observed him, and then retreated
rapidly. The soldier resumed his route towards Saint-Mande, his mind
occupied with the gentleman who had implored his protection. Suddenly
he thought of his letter, and, looking at his belt, saw that it was no
longer there. Dâ€™Artagnan derived no little satisfaction from his sudden,
terrified cry. The poor soldier in the greatest anguish of mind looked
round him on every side, and at last, about twenty paces behind him,
he perceived the lucky envelope. He pounced on it like a falcon on its
prey. The envelope was certainly a little dirty, and rather crumpled,
but at all events the letter itself was found. Dâ€™Artagnan observed that
the broken seal attracted the soldierâ€™s attention a good deal, but he
finished apparently by consoling himself, and returned the letter to his

regulating his pace according to that of the soldier, he promised
himself to arrive a quarter of an hour after him at M. Fouquetâ€™s.
Chapter III. In Which the Reader will be Delighted to Find that Porthos
Has Lost Nothing of His Muscularity.
Dâ€™Artagnan had, according to his usual style, calculated that every hour
is worth sixty minutes, and every minute worth sixty seconds. Thanks to
this perfectly exact calculation of minutes and seconds, he reached the
superintendentâ€™s door at the very moment the soldier was leaving it with
his belt empty. Dâ€™Artagnan presented himself at the door, which a porter
with a profusely embroidered livery held half opened for him. Dâ€™Artagnan
would very much have liked to enter without giving his name, but this
was impossible, and so he gave it. Notwithstanding this concession,
which ought to have removed every difficulty in the way, at least
Dâ€™Artagnan thought so, the _concierge_ hesitated; however, at the second
repetition of the title, captain of the kingâ€™s guards, the _concierge_,
without quite leaving the passage clear for him, ceased to bar it
completely. Dâ€™Artagnan understood that orders of the most positive
character had been given. He decided, therefore, to tell a falsehood,--a
circumstance, moreover, which did not seriously affect his peace of
mind, when he saw that beyond the falsehood the safety of the state
itself, or even purely and simply his own individual personal interest,
might be at stake. He moreover added to the declarations he had already
made, that the soldier sent to M. du Vallon was his own messenger,
and that the only object that letter had in view was to announce his
intended arrival. From that moment, no one opposed Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s entrance
any further, and he entered accordingly. A valet wished to accompany
him, but he answered that it was useless to take that trouble on his
account, inasmuch as he knew perfectly well where M. du Vallon was.
There was nothing, of course, to say to a man so thoroughly and
completely informed on all points, and Dâ€™Artagnan was permitted,
therefore, to do as he liked. The terraces, the magnificent apartments,
the gardens, were all reviewed and narrowly inspected by the musketeer.
He walked for a quarter of an hour in this more than royal residence,
which included as many wonders as articles of furniture, and as many

reached a remote part of the chateau inclosed by a stone wall, which was
covered with a profusion of thick plants, luxuriant in blossoms as large
and solid as fruit. At equal distances on the top of this wall were
placed various statues in timid or mysterious attitudes. These were
vestals hidden beneath the long Greek peplum, with its thick, sinuous
folds; agile nymphs, covered with their marble veils, and guarding the
palace with their fugitive glances. A statue of Hermes, with his
finger on his lips; one of Iris, with extended wings; another of Night,
sprinkled all over with poppies, dominated the gardens and outbuildings,
which could be seen through the trees. All these statues threw in white
relief their profiles upon the dark ground of the tall cypresses, which
darted their somber summits towards the sky. Around these cypresses were
entwined climbing roses, whose flowering rings were fastened to every
fork of the branches, and spread over the lower boughs and the various
statues, showers of flowers of the rarest fragrance. These enchantments
seemed to the musketeer the result of the greatest efforts of the human
mind. He felt in a dreamy, almost poetical, frame of mind. The idea
that Porthos was living in so perfect an Eden gave him a higher idea of
Porthos, showing how tremendously true it is, that even the very highest
orders of minds are not quite exempt from the influence of surroundings.
Dâ€™Artagnan found the door, and on, or rather in the door, a kind
of spring which he detected; having touched it, the door flew open.
Dâ€™Artagnan entered, closed the door behind him, and advanced into a
pavilion built in a circular form, in which no other sound could be
heard but cascades and the songs of birds. At the door of the pavilion
he met a lackey.

Dâ€™Artagnan was introduced into the _salon_, and had not long to remain

â€œMy foot darted out like a ballista, and came against the partition,

upon the dome which we have at the top of our head, than there was a
report like a cannon, the crystal was broken to pieces, and I fell,

NA
â€œNot at all; with perfumes, which smelt like rich creams; it was
delicious, but the odor was too strong, and I felt quite giddy from it;
NA
â€œYes, in inhaling the scent of the lily of the valley; so that, my
poor friend, you were knocked over by the shock and overpowered by the

it, these things seem really only to happen to me! Instead of making
indentations, they made bumps. The doctor could never succeed in

M. de Thou, M. de Cinq-Mars, M. Chalais, M. de Bouteville, and M. de

engineer under whose directions the works were carried out; you are
modest, as all men of true genius are; perhaps Aramis wishes to put you

Porthos did not even perceive the difference. The servants talked a
little with each other in an undertone, and whispered a few words,

Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos returned on foot, as Dâ€™Artagnan had set out.
When Dâ€™Artagnan, as he entered the shop of the Pilon dâ€™Or, announced to
Planchet that M. du Vallon would be one of the privileged travelers, and
as the plume in Porthosâ€™s hat made the wooden candles suspended over the
front jingle together, a melancholy presentiment seemed to eclipse the
delight Planchet had promised himself for the morrow. But the grocer
had a heart of gold, ever mindful of the good old times--a trait that
carries youth into old age. So Planchet, notwithstanding a sort of
internal shiver, checked as soon as experienced, received Porthos with
respect, mingled with the tenderest cordiality. Porthos, who was a
little cold and stiff in his manners at first, on account of the social
difference existing at that period between a baron and a grocer, soon
began to soften when he perceived so much good-feeling and so many kind
attentions in Planchet. He was particularly touched by the liberty which
was permitted him to plunge his great palms into the boxes of dried
fruits and preserves, into the sacks of nuts and almonds, and into the
drawers full of sweetmeats. So that, notwithstanding Planchetâ€™s pressing
invitations to go upstairs to the _entresol_, he chose as his favorite
seat, during the evening which he had to spend at Planchetâ€™s house, the
shop itself, where his fingers could always fish up whatever his nose
detected. The delicious figs from Provence, filberts from the forest,
Tours plums, were subjects of his uninterrupted attention for five
consecutive hours. His teeth, like millstones, cracked heaps of nuts,
the shells of which were scattered all over the floor, where they were
trampled by every one who went in and out of the shop; Porthos pulled
from the stalk with his lips, at one mouthful, bunches of the rich
Muscatel raisins with their beautiful bloom, half a pound of which
passed at one gulp from his mouth to his stomach. In one of the corners
of the shop, Planchetâ€™s assistants, huddled together, looked at each
other without venturing to open their lips. They did not know who
Porthos was, for they had never seen him before. The race of those
Titans who had worn the cuirasses of Hugh Capet, Philip Augustus,
and Francis I. had already begun to disappear. They could hardly help
thinking he might be the ogre of the fairy tale, who was going to turn
the whole contents of Planchetâ€™s shop into his insatiable stomach, and
that, too, without in the slightest degree displacing the barrels and
chests that were in it. Cracking, munching, chewing, nibbling, sucking,
and swallowing, Porthos occasionally said to the grocer:
NA
â€œHe will very soon have none at all to do, if this sort of thing
NA
be his successor. In the midst of his despair, he approached Porthos,
who blocked up the whole of the passage leading from the back shop to
the shop itself. He hoped that Porthos would rise and that this movement
would distract his devouring ideas.
NA
â€œI should like to pass you, monsieur, if it is not troubling you too
NA
NA
At the same moment he took hold of the young fellow by the waistband,
lifted him off the ground, and placed him very gently on the other
side, smiling all the while with the same affable expression. As soon as
Porthos had placed him on the ground, the ladâ€™s legs so shook under him
that he fell back upon some sacks of corks. But noticing the giantâ€™s
gentleness of manner, he ventured again, and said:

which the wants of the customers were supplied into it, and swallowed a

bottle to his mouth, as a trumpeter does his trumpet, he emptied the
bottle at a single draught.
Planchet was agitated in every fibre of propriety and self-esteem.
However, a worthy representative of the hospitality which prevailed in
early days, he feigned to be talking very earnestly with Dâ€™Artagnan, and
NA
NA
NA
The foreman clasped his hands together. The two others got under the
counters, fearing Porthos might have a taste for human flesh.

NA

NA
NA
NA
a personage of the highest quality in an appetite of that kind. This
title, too, reassured them. They had never heard that an ogre was ever

carelessly; and he emptied a whole jar of aniseed biscuits into the huge
pocket of his doublet.

Planchet looked all round his shop, and observing the different articles

entreaty, which the latter half understood.
As soon as they had finished eating they set off. It was late when the
three riders, who had left Paris about six in the evening, arrived at
Fontainebleau. The journey passed very agreeably. Porthos took a fancy
to Planchetâ€™s society, because the latter was very respectful in his
manners, and seemed delighted to talk to him about his meadows, his
woods, and his rabbit-warrens. Porthos had all the taste and pride of
a landed proprietor. When Dâ€™Artagnan saw his two companions in earnest
conversation, he took the opposite side of the road, and letting his
bridle drop upon his horseâ€™s neck, separated himself from the whole
world, as he had done from Porthos and from Planchet. The moon shone
softly through the foliage of the forest. The breezes of the open
country rose deliciously perfumed to the horseâ€™s nostrils, and they
snorted and pranced along delightedly. Porthos and Planchet began to
talk about hay-crops. Planchet admitted to Porthos that in the advanced
years of his life, he had certainly neglected agricultural pursuits
for commerce, but that his childhood had been passed in Picardy in the
beautiful meadows where the grass grew as high as the knees, and where
he had played under the green apple-trees covered with red-cheeked
fruit; he went on to say, that he had solemnly promised himself that as
soon as he should have made his fortune, he would return to nature, and
end his days, as he had begun them, as near as he possibly could to the
earth itself, where all men must sleep at last.
NA
NA

â€œCome, tell me what is the extent of your ambition, and what is the

short, and you would have spoken to me then in a much more familiar

rapidity which distinguished every operation of his mind and body. â€œIt
was not Dâ€™Artagnan who entered into the grocery business, but Planchet

to me as familiarly as in old times. You cannot possibly imagine the
NA
NA
 replied Porthos. And as he was quite close to Planchet, he raised
his hand, as if to strike him on the shoulder, in token of friendly
cordiality; but a fortunate movement of the horse made him miss his aim,
so that his hand fell on the crupper of Planchetâ€™s horse, instead; which
made the animalâ€™s legs almost give way.
Dâ€™Artagnan burst out laughing, as he said, â€œTake care, Planchet; for
if Porthos begins to like you so much, he will caress you, and if he
caresses you he will knock you as flat as a pancake. Porthos is still as

NA

â€œYes; we will reckon up the meadows presently, and the woods

times, is for me a sufficiently pleasing picture of war on a small

They had reached this turn of conversation, when Planchet, looking up,
perceived the houses at the commencement of Fontainebleau, the lofty
outlines of which stood out strongly against the misty visage of the
heavens; whilst, rising above the compact and irregularly formed mass
of buildings, the pointed roofs of the chateau were clearly visible, the
slates of which glistened beneath the light of the moon, like the scales

Chapter V. Planchetâ€™s Country-House.
The cavaliers looked up, and saw that what Planchet had announced to
them was true. Ten minutes afterwards they were in the street called the
Rue de Lyon, on the opposite side of the hostelry of the Beau Paon.
A high hedge of bushy elders, hawthorn, and wild hops formed an
impenetrable fence, behind which rose a white house, with a high tiled
roof. Two of the windows, which were quite dark, looked upon the street.
Between the two, a small door, with a porch supported by a couple of
pillars, formed the entrance to the house. The door was gained by a step
raised a little from the ground. Planchet got off his horse, as if he
intended to knock at the door; but, on second thoughts, he took hold of
his horse by the bridle, and led it about thirty paces further on, his
two companions following him. He then advanced about another thirty
paces, until he arrived at the door of a cart-house, lighted by an
iron grating; and, lifting up a wooden latch, pushed open one of the
folding-doors. He entered first, leading his horse after him by the
bridle, into a small courtyard, where an odor met them which revealed
NA
loudly, getting off his horse, â€œand I almost begin to think I am near my

NA
NA
NA
When the two cavaliers had entered, Planchet fastened the door behind
them. In the meantime, Dâ€™Artagnan, who had dismounted with his usual
agility, inhaled the fresh perfumed air with the delight a Parisian
feels at the sight of green fields and fresh foliage, plucked a piece
of honeysuckle with one hand, and of sweet-briar with the other. Porthos
clawed hold of some peas which were twined round poles stuck into
the ground, and ate, or rather browsed upon them, shells and all: and
Planchet was busily engaged trying to wake up an old and infirm peasant,
who was fast asleep in a shed, lying on a bed of moss, and dressed in
an old stable suit of clothes. The peasant, recognizing Planchet, called
NA
NA
Planchet.

NA
crossed a kitchen-garden, then a small paddock, and came out into a
little garden behind the house, the principal front of which, as we have
already noticed, faced the street. As they approached, they could
see, through two open windows on the ground floor, which led into a
sitting-room, the interior of Planchetâ€™s residence. This room, softly
lighted by a lamp placed on the table, seemed, from the end of the
garden, like a smiling image of repose, comfort, and happiness. In every
direction where the rays of light fell, whether upon a piece of old
china, or upon an article of furniture shining from excessive neatness,
or upon the weapons hanging against the wall, the soft light was softly
reflected; and its rays seemed to linger everywhere upon something or
another, agreeable to the eye. The lamp which lighted the room, whilst
the foliage of jasmine and climbing roses hung in masses from the
window-frames, splendidly illuminated a damask table-cloth as white as
snow. The table was laid for two persons. Amber-colored wine sparkled
in a long cut-glass bottle; and a large jug of blue china, with a silver
lid, was filled with foaming cider. Near the table, in a high-backed
armchair, reclined, fast asleep, a woman of about thirty years of age,
her face the very picture of health and freshness. Upon her knees lay
a large cat, with her paws folded under her, and her eyes half-closed,
purring in that significant manner which, according to feline habits,
indicates perfect contentment. The two friends paused before the window
in complete amazement, while Planchet, perceiving their astonishment,
was in no little degree secretly delighted at it.
NA
NA
NA
voice of thunder. At the sound of this gigantic voice, the cat took
flight, the housekeeper woke up with a start, and Planchet, assuming
a gracious air, introduced his two companions into the room, where the
table was already laid.

NA
most courteous manner, and with precisely the same chivalrous air as he
would have taken Madameâ€™s.

Planchet. Porthos bowed with a reverence which Anne of Austria would
have approved of.
It was then Planchetâ€™s turn, and he unhesitatingly embraced the lady
in question, not, however, until he had made a sign as if requesting
Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s and Porthosâ€™s permission, a permission as a matter of
course frankly conceded. Dâ€™Artagnan complimented Planchet, and said,

the habit of beating her. Being myself a Picard born, I was always
very fond of the Artesian women, and it is only a step from Artois to
Flanders; she came crying bitterly to her godfather, my predecessor
in the Rue des Lombards; she placed her two thousand florins in my
establishment, which I have turned to very good account, and which have

NA
Truchen, with perfect ingenuousness.
NA
NA
In the meantime Truchen had set her cook to work, had laid the table for
two more, and covered it with every possible delicacy that could convert
a light supper into a substantial meal, a meal into a regular feast.
Fresh butter, salt beef, anchovies, tunny, a shopful of Planchetâ€™s
commodities, fowls, vegetables, salad, fish from the pond and the
river, game from the forest--all the produce, in fact, of the province.
Moreover, Planchet returned from the cellar, laden with ten bottles of
wine, the glass of which could hardly be seen for the thick coating of
dust which covered them. Porthosâ€™s heart began to expand as he said, â€œI

in the most killing manner. Dâ€™Artagnan seated himself on the other side
of her, while Planchet, discreetly and full of delight, took his seat
opposite.

In fact, the housekeeper made her escape quite frequently, and they
could hear, on the first floor above them, the creaking of the wooden
bedsteads and the rolling of the castors on the floor. While this
was going on, the three men, Porthos especially, ate and drank
gloriously,--it was wonderful to see them. The ten full bottles were ten
empty ones by the time Truchen returned with the cheese. Dâ€™Artagnan
still preserved his dignity and self-possession, but Porthos had lost
a portion of his; and the mirth soon began to grow somewhat uproarious.
Dâ€™Artagnan recommended a new descent into the cellar, and, as Planchet
no longer walked with the steadiness of a well-trained foot-soldier,
the captain of the musketeers proposed to accompany him. They set off,
humming songs wild enough to frighten anybody who might be listening.
Truchen remained behind at table with Porthos. While the two
wine-bibbers were looking behind the firewood for what they wanted, a
sharp report was heard like the impact of a pair of lips on a ladyâ€™s
cheek.
NA
returned freighted with bottles. Planchet was singing so loudly that
he was incapable of noticing anything. Dâ€™Artagnan, whom nothing ever
escaped, remarked how much redder Truchenâ€™s left cheek was than her
right. Porthos was sitting on Truchenâ€™s left, and was curling with both
his hands both sides of his mustache at once, and Truchen was looking at
him with a most bewitching smile. The sparkling wine of Anjou very soon
produced a remarkable effect upon the three companions. Dâ€™Artagnan had
hardly strength enough left to take a candlestick to light Planchet up
his own staircase. Planchet was pulling Porthos along, who was following
Truchen, who was herself jovial enough. It was Dâ€™Artagnan who found out
the rooms and the beds. Porthos threw himself into the one destined for
him, after his friend had undressed him. Dâ€™Artagnan got into his own
bed, saying to himself, â€œ_Mordioux!_ I had made up my mind never to
touch that light-colored wine, which brings my early camp days back
again. Fie! fie! if my musketeers were only to see their captain in such

which passed through the wooden footboard, and made a tremendous
crash, of which, however, no one in the house was capable of taking
the slightest notice. By two oâ€™clock in the morning every one was fast
asleep.
Chapter VI. Showing What Could Be Seen from Planchetâ€™s House.
The next morning found the three heroes sleeping soundly. Truchen had
closed the outside blinds to keep the first rays of the sun from the
leaden-lidded eyes of her guests, like a kind, good housekeeper. It
was still perfectly dark, then, beneath Porthosâ€™s curtains and under
Planchetâ€™s canopy, when Dâ€™Artagnan, awakened by an indiscreet ray of
light which made its way through a peek-hole in the shutters, jumped
hastily out of bed, as if he wished to be the first at a forlorn hope.
He took by assault Porthosâ€™s room, which was next to his own. The worthy
Porthos was sleeping with a noise like distant thunder; in the dim
obscurity of the room his gigantic frame was prominently displayed, and
his swollen fist hung down outside the bed upon the carpet. Dâ€™Artagnan
awoke Porthos, who rubbed his eyes in a tolerably good humor. In the
meantime Planchet was dressing himself, and met at their bedroom doors
his two guests, who were still somewhat unsteady from their previous
eveningâ€™s entertainment. Although it was yet very early, the whole
household was already up. The cook was mercilessly slaughtering in
the poultry-yard; Celestin was gathering white cherries in the garden.
Porthos, brisk and lively as ever, held out his hand to Planchetâ€™s, and
Dâ€™Artagnan requested permission to embrace Madame Truchen. The latter,
to show that she bore no ill-will, approached Porthos, upon whom she
conferred the same favor. Porthos embraced Madame Truchen, heaving an
enormous sigh. Planchet took both his friends by the hand.
NA
night it was as dark as an oven, and we were unable to see anything;
but in broad daylight, everything looks different, and you will be

day passes that some one is not buried there; for Fontainebleau is by no
means an inconsiderable place. Sometimes we see young girls clothed in
white carrying banners; at others, some of the town-council, or rich

and of considering all good they meet with during their transitory stay
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan sat down close to the window, and as there seemed to be
something substantial in Planchetâ€™s philosophy, he mused over it.

disdainfully; â€œthe officiating priest, the beadle, and only one
chorister boy, nothing more. You observe, messieurs, that the defunct

melancholy at first that I could do nothing but make the sign of the

my head; but now, they lull me to sleep, and no bird I have ever seen
or heard can sing better than those which are to be met with in this

Planchet with one bound was beside his guest, whom he offered to lead
into the garden.

Planchet left, and Dâ€™Artagnan remained, devouring with his eager gaze
from behind the half-closed blinds what was taking place just before
him. The two bearers of the corpse had unfastened the straps by which
they carried the litter, and were letting their burden glide gently into
the open grave. At a few paces distant, the man with the cloak wrapped
round him, the only spectator of this melancholy scene, was leaning
with his back against a large cypress-tree, and kept his face and person
entirely concealed from the grave-diggers and the priests; the corpse
was buried in five minutes. The grave having been filled up, the priests
turned away, and the grave-digger having addressed a few words to them,
followed them as they moved away. The man in the mantle bowed as they
passed him, and put a piece of gold into the grave-diggerâ€™s hand.
NA
Aramis, in fact, remained alone, on that side at least; for hardly had
he turned his head when a womanâ€™s footsteps, and the rustling of her
dress, were heard in the path close to him. He immediately turned round,
and took off his hat with the most ceremonious respect; he led the lady
under the shelter of some walnut and lime trees, which overshadowed a
magnificent tomb.
NA

NA
The conversation lasted for fully half an hour. Dâ€™Artagnan could not see
the ladyâ€™s face, for she kept her back turned towards him; but he saw
perfectly well, by the erect attitude of both the speakers, by their
gestures, by the measured and careful manner with which they glanced
at each other, either by way of attack or defense, that they must be
conversing about any other subject than of love. At the end of the
conversation the lady rose, and bowed profoundly to Aramis.

This seemed impossible, however, for Aramis was the first to leave;
the lady carefully concealed her head and face, and then immediately
departed. Dâ€™Artagnan could hold out no longer; he ran to the window
which looked out on the Rue de Lyon, and saw Aramis entering the inn.
The lady was proceeding in quite an opposite direction, and seemed, in
fact, to be about to rejoin an equipage, consisting of two led horses
and a carriage, which he could see standing close to the borders of
the forest. She was walking slowly, her head bent down, absorbed in the
deepest meditation.

shot in his legs, and then turning suddenly round as if he were going

 Dâ€™Artagnan would not go home until he had learnt everything. He asked

Chapter VII. How Porthos, Truchen, and Planchet Parted with Each Other
on Friendly Terms, Thanks to Dâ€™Artagnan.
There was good living in Planchetâ€™s house. Porthos broke a ladder and
two cherry-trees, stripped the raspberry-bushes, and was only unable to
succeed in reaching the strawberry-beds on account, as he said, of his
belt. Truchen, who had become quite sociable with the giant, said that
it was not the belt so much as his corporation; and Porthos, in a state
of the highest delight, embraced Truchen, who gathered him a pailful of
the strawberries, and made him eat them out of her hands. Dâ€™Artagnan,
who arrived in the midst of these little innocent flirtations, scolded
Porthos for his indolence, and silently pitied Planchet. Porthos
breakfasted with a very good appetite, and when he had finished, he
NA
 Truchen smiled at his remark, and so did Planchet, but not without
embarrassment.
Dâ€™Artagnan then addressed Porthos: â€œYou must not let the delights of
NA
NA
â€œCertainly. I am going to take a turn in the town to get everything
NA
NA
Planchet looked at Dâ€™Artagnan nervously.
NA
â€œNo, my friend; and this very evening I will release you from two
NA
NA
â€œNo, no; you are a noble-hearted fellow, but your house is very small.
Such a house, with half a dozen acres of land, would be fit for a king,
NA
NA
â€œBut he has become so, my good fellow; his income has been a hundred
thousand francs a year for the last twenty years, and for the last fifty
years Porthos has been the owner of a couple of fists and a backbone,
which are not to be matched throughout the whole realm of France.
Porthos is a man of the very greatest consequence compared to you,
and... well, I need say no more, for I know you are an intelligent
NA
NA
â€œLook at your orchard, how stripped it is, how empty your larder, your
bedstead broken, your cellar almost exhausted, look too... at Madame

NA
NA
NA
shoulder.
Planchet at this moment perceived Porthos and Truchen sitting close
together in an arbor; Truchen, with a grace of manner peculiarly
Flemish, was making a pair of earrings for Porthos out of a double
cherry, while Porthos was laughing as amorously as Samson in the company
of Delilah. Planchet pressed Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s hand, and ran towards the
arbor. We must do Porthos the justice to say that he did not move as
they approached, and, very likely, he did not think he was doing any
harm. Nor indeed did Truchen move either, which rather put Planchet out;
but he, too, had been so accustomed to see fashionable folk in his shop,
that he found no difficulty in putting a good countenance on what seemed
disagreeable or rude. Planchet seized Porthos by the arm, and proposed
to go and look at the horses, but Porthos pretended he was tired.
Planchet then suggested that the Baron du Vallon should taste some
noyeau of his own manufacture, which was not to be equaled anywhere; an
offer the baron immediately accepted; and, in this way, Planchet managed
to engage his enemyâ€™s attention during the whole of the day, by dint of
sacrificing his cellar, in preference to his _amour propre_. Two hours
afterwards Dâ€™Artagnan returned.
NA
NA
NA
thing to have to confess, but a manâ€™s heart is like an ocean billow;
for, from that very moment Porthos ceased to look at Madame Truchen
in that touching manner which had so softened her heart. Planchet
encouraged these ambitious leanings as best as he could. He talked over,
or rather gave exaggerated accounts of all the splendors of the last
reign, its battles, sieges, and grand court ceremonies. He spoke of the
luxurious display which the English made; the prizes the three brave
companions carried off; and how Dâ€™Artagnan, who at the beginning had
been the humblest of the four, finished by becoming the leader. He fired
Porthos with a generous feeling of enthusiasm by reminding him of his
early youth now passed away; he boasted as much as he could of the moral
life this great lord had led, and how religiously he respected the ties
of friendship; he was eloquent, and skillful in his choice of subjects.
He tickled Porthos, frightened Truchen, and made Dâ€™Artagnan think. At
six oâ€™clock, the musketeer ordered the horses to be brought round, and
told Porthos to get ready. He thanked Planchet for his kind hospitality,
whispered a few words about a post he might succeed in obtaining for
him at court, which immediately raised Planchet in Truchenâ€™s estimation,
where the poor grocer--so good, so generous, so devoted--had become much
lowered ever since the appearance and comparison with him of the two
great gentlemen. Such, however, is a womanâ€™s nature; they are anxious
to possess what they have not got, and disdain it as soon as it is
acquired. After having rendered this service to his friend Planchet,
Dâ€™Artagnan said in a low tone of voice to Porthos: â€œThat is a very

NA
NA
 replied Dâ€™Artagnan, a suggestion which Porthos seemed to hesitate to
adopt.
NA
understand your feelings; a great lord such as you would not think of
accepting the hospitality of an old servant without paying him most
handsomely for it: but I am sure that Planchet is too good-hearted a
fellow to remember that you have an income of a hundred thousand francs
NA
NA
â€œto make Madame Truchen a present of my little farm at Bracieux; it has

â€œIt is too much, my good Porthos, too much just at present... Keep it

approaching Truchen, said to her:--â€œMadame, monsieur le baron hardly
knows how to entreat you, out of your regard for him, to accept this
little ring. M. du Vallon is one of the most generous and discreet
men of my acquaintance. He wished to offer you a farm that he has at
NA
NA
NA
NA
well represented by Dâ€™Artagnan. These several exclamations, uttered at
the same moment, made quite a pathetic winding-up of a day which might
have finished in a very ridiculous manner. But Dâ€™Artagnan was there,
and, on every occasion, wheresoever Dâ€™Artagnan exercised any control,
matters ended only just in the very way he wished and willed. There were
general embracings; Truchen, whom the baronâ€™s munificence had restored
to her proper position, very timidly, and blushing all the while,
presented her forehead to the great lord with whom she had been on such
very pretty terms the evening before. Planchet himself was overcome by
a feeling of genuine humility. Still, in the same generosity of
disposition, Porthos would have emptied his pockets into the hands of
the cook and of Celestin; but Dâ€™Artagnan stopped him.
NA
and two to the man; and the benedictions which were showered down
upon them would have rejoiced the heart of Harpagon himself, and have
rendered even him a prodigal.
Dâ€™Artagnan made Planchet lead them to the chateau, and introduced
Porthos into his own apartment, where he arrived safely without having
been perceived by those he was afraid of meeting.
Chapter VIII. The Presentation of Porthos at Court.
At seven oâ€™clock the same evening, the king gave an audience to an
ambassador from the United Provinces, in the grand reception-room. The
audience lasted a quarter of an hour. His majesty afterwards received
those who had been recently presented, together with a few ladies, who
paid their respects first. In one corner of the salon, concealed behind
a column, Porthos and Dâ€™Artagnan were conversing together, waiting until
their turn arrived.
NA
NA
NA
in full court dress, leading Aramis towards the king.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou--oh, you! as I have already had the honor of telling you, are the
good-natured, kind-hearted Porthos; and so they begged you to take care

NA
NA

At this moment Fouquet addressed the king.

majesty needs a representative at Rome, who would be able to exercise
a powerful influence there; may I request a cardinalâ€™s hat for M.

NA
NA
any hesitation he might have in that manner, and to which remark there
was nothing to say in reply.
Fouquet and Aramis looked at each other. The king resumed: â€œM. dâ€™Herblay
NA
NA
â€œyour majesty overwhelms M. dâ€™Herblay; the archbishopric may, in your
majestyâ€™s extreme kindness, be conferred in addition to the hat; the one

The king admired the readiness which he displayed, and smiled, saying:

As soon as Aramis saw Porthos, he turned as pale as death, while Fouquet
clenched his hands under his ruffles. Dâ€™Artagnan smiled blandly at
both of them, while Porthos bowed, visibly overcome before the royal
presence.

presented M. du Vallon to your majesty; but certain men resemble stars,
they move not one inch unless their satellites accompany them. The

Aramis almost lost countenance. He looked at Dâ€™Artagnan with a proud,
haughty air, as though willing to accept the defiance the latter seemed
to throw down.
NA
â€œExcellent friends, sire; the one can answer for the other. Ask M. de
NA
a step.
NA
 and he indicated Porthos with his hand, who bowed a second time.
Louis could not withhold his admiration, though at the same time his
suspicions were aroused.

fatherâ€™s ministers by his advice--M. dâ€™Herblay, in a word, who, with
M. du Vallon, myself, and M. le Comte de la Fere, who is known to your
majesty, formed that quartette which was a good deal talked about during

Aramis advanced and bowed: â€œIn order to serve the son as I served the

Dâ€™Artagnan looked very narrowly at Aramis while he uttered these words,
which displayed so much true respect, so much warm devotion, such entire
frankness and sincerity, that even he, Dâ€™Artagnan, the eternal doubter,
he, the almost infallible in judgment, was deceived by it. â€œA man who

anxiously awaited the result of this proof, â€œthe cardinalâ€™s hat is

the looks and the fire of a thousand foes. But, knowing what his
thoughts are, I--who am more accustomed to gaze upon the sun--can
translate them: he needs nothing, absolutely nothing; his sole desire
is to have the happiness of gazing upon your majesty for a quarter of an

Porthos became crimson from delight and pride. The king dismissed him,
and Dâ€™Artagnan pushed him into the adjoining apartment, after he had
embraced him warmly.

â€œAramis has never liked you so much as he does now. Fancy, it was I who

Chapter IX. Explanations.
Aramis cleverly managed to effect a diversion for the purpose of finding
Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos. He came up to the latter, behind one of the
columns, and, as he pressed his hand, said, â€œSo you have escaped from my

NA
NA
NA

Dâ€™Artagnan came to the assistance of Porthos, who already began to
breathe hard, in sore perplexity.
â€œYou see, you members of the Church are great politicians; we mere
soldiers come at once to the point. The facts are these: I went to pay

Aramis pricked up his ears at this announcement.
NA
NA
we have already seen. Aramis begged to be allowed to read it, and read
it without Dâ€™Artagnan feeling in the slightest degree embarrassed by
the circumstance that he was so well acquainted with the contents of it.
Besides, Aramisâ€™s face was so impenetrable, that Dâ€™Artagnan could not
but admire him more than ever; after he had read it, he put the letter
into his pocket with the calmest possible air.

NA
NA
NA
NA
our friends. I must say that Baisemeaux received me coldly; so I soon
took my leave of him. As I was returning, a soldier accosted me, and
said (no doubt as he recognized me, notwithstanding I was in private
clothes), â€˜Captain, will you be good enough to read me the name written
on this envelope?â€™ and I read, â€˜To Monsieur du Vallon, at M. Fouquetâ€™s
house, Saint-Mande.â€™ The deuce, I said to myself, Porthos has not
returned, then, as I fancied, to Bell-Isle, or to Pierrefonds, but is
at M. Fouquetâ€™s house, at Saint-Mande; and as M. Fouquet is not at
Saint-Mande, Porthos must be quite alone, or, at all events, with
Aramis; I will go and see Porthos, and I accordingly went to see

who makes very excellent preserves; but his house has windows which look
out upon the cemetery. And a confoundedly melancholy prospect it is! So

NA
Dâ€™Artagnan turned his back to them, and walked to the window, where he
began to play a march upon one of the panes of glass.
NA
NA
â€œVery depressing, was it not? I should never be able to live in a house
where burials can always be seen from the window. Dâ€™Artagnan, on the

Aramis started, and turned to look at the musketeer, but the latter was
engaged in earnest conversation with Saint-Aignan. Aramis continued to
question Porthos, and when he had squeezed all the juice out of this
enormous lemon, he threw the peel aside. He turned towards his friend
Dâ€™Artagnan, and clapping him on the shoulder, when Saint-Aignan had left

They sat down, and Aramis took one of Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s hands in his.
â€œTell me, candidly, my dear friend, whether you have not counseled

â€œBut before I could deprive you of that pleasure, I ought to have been

â€œOf you! yes. How the devil could I imagine that Aramis had become
so clever an engineer as to be able to fortify like Polybius, or

â€œI certainly made as much haste as I could, since I saw that you were
making still more. When a man weighing two hundred and fifty pounds, as
Porthos does, rides post; when a gouty prelate--I beg your pardon, but
you yourself told me you were so--when a prelate scours the highway--I
naturally suppose that my two friends, who did not wish to be
communicative with me, had certain matters of the highest importance
to conceal from me, and so I made as much haste as my leanness and the

â€œA mortal enemy. Well, in order to counteract that manâ€™s influence, it
was necessary that M. Fouquet should give the king a proof of his great

He surprised his majesty by offering him Belle-Isle. If you had been the
first to reach Paris, the surprise would have been destroyed, it would

whom you are acting. Are you a friend of M. Colbert, or of M. Fouquet?â€™
Perhaps I should not have answered you, but you would have added,--â€˜Are

a note, which the governor of Belle-Isle gave me for your majesty;â€™ or,
â€˜M. Fouquet is about to wait upon your majesty to explain his intentions

Dâ€™Artagnan stroked his mustache, but said nothing.
â€œI saw Porthos and again cultivated his acquaintance; his own time
hanging idly on his hands, his presence recalled my earlier and better
days without engaging me in any present evil. I sent for Porthos to come
to Vannes. M. Fouquet, whose regard for me is very great, having
learnt that Porthos and I were attached to each other by old ties of

Chapter X. Madame and De Guiche.
It will not be forgotten how Comte de Guiche left the queen-motherâ€™s
apartments on the day when Louis XIV. presented La Valliere with the
beautiful bracelets he had won in the lottery. The comte walked to and
fro for some time outside the palace, in the greatest distress, from
a thousand suspicions and anxieties with which his mind was beset.
Presently he stopped and waited on the terrace opposite the grove of
trees, watching for Madameâ€™s departure. More than half an hour passed
away; and as he was at that moment quite alone, the comte could hardly
have had any very diverting ideas at his command. He drew his tables
from his pocket, and, after hesitating over and over again, determined
to write these words:--â€œMadame, I implore you to grant me one momentâ€™s
conversation. Do not be alarmed at this request, which contains nothing
in any way opposed to the profound respect with which I subscribe
NA
when he suddenly observed several ladies leaving the chateau, and
afterwards several courtiers too; in fact, almost every one that formed
the queenâ€™s circle. He saw La Valliere herself, then Montalais talking
with Malicorne; he watched the departure of the very last of the
numerous guests that had a short time before thronged the queen-motherâ€™s
cabinet.
Madame herself had not yet passed; she would be obliged, however, to
cross the courtyard in order to enter her own apartments; and, from the
terrace where he was standing, De Guiche could see all that was going on
in the courtyard. At last he saw Madame leave, attended by a couple
of pages, who were carrying torches before her. She was walking very
quickly; as soon as she reached the door, she said:
â€œLet some one go and look for De Guiche: he has to render an account
of a mission he had to discharge for me; if he should be disengaged,

De Guiche remained silent, hidden in the shade; but as soon as Madame
had withdrawn, he darted from the terrace down the steps and assumed a
most indifferent air, so that the pages who were hurrying towards his
rooms might meet him.
NA

â€œYes, M. le comte, her royal highness has been asking for you; she

When De Guiche entered the princessâ€™s apartments, he found her pale and
agitated. Montalais was standing at the door, evidently uneasy about
what was passing in her mistressâ€™s mind. De Guiche appeared.
NA
NA
Montalais, more puzzled than ever, courtesied and withdrew. De Guiche
and the princess were left alone. The comte had every advantage in his
favor; it was Madame who had summoned him to a rendezvous. But how was
it possible for the comte to make use of this advantage? Madame was so
whimsical, and her disposition so changeable. She soon allowed this to
be perceived, for, suddenly, opening the conversation, she said: â€œWell!
NA
He imagined she must have guessed his thoughts; he fancied (for those
who are in love are thus constituted, being as credulous and blind as
poets or prophets), he fancied she knew how ardent was his desire to see
her, and also the subject uppermost in his mind.

Guiche looked at her for some time; her eyes sank under his gaze, which
seemed to read her very heart.

Madame began to laugh in a manner that produced a sinister impression
upon De Guiche.
â€œI repeat, Madame, I do not believe the king is in love with
Mademoiselle de la Valliere; and the proof that I do not believe it is,
that I was about to ask you whose _amour propre_ it is likely the king
is desirous of wounding? You, who are well acquainted with the whole
court, can perhaps assist me in ascertaining that; and assuredly, with
greater certainty, since it is everywhere said that your royal highness

eyes, â€œprove to me, I say, that you intended to interrogate me at the

coolness and silent respect having made her completely lose her temper.
De Guiche fell back a step, bowed slowly, but with great respect, drew
himself up, looking as white as his lace cuffs, and, in a voice slightly
trembling, said, â€œIt was hardly worth while to have hurried here to be

He had scarcely gone half a dozen paces when Madame darted like a
tigress after him, seized him by the cuff, and making him turn round
again, said, trembling with passion as she did so, â€œThe respect you
pretend to have is more insulting than the insult itself. Insult me, if

At the look he fixed upon her,--a look full of love, resolution, and
despair, even,--she knew how readily the comte, so outwardly calm in
appearance, would pass his sword through his own breast if she added
another word. She tore the blade from his hands, and, pressing his arm
with a feverish impatience, which might pass for tenderness, said, â€œDo
not be too hard upon me, comte. You see how I am suffering, and yet you

Tears, the cries of this strange attack, stifled her voice. As soon as
De Guiche saw her weep, he took her in his arms and carried her to an

The argument was a telling one, and the princess was overwhelmed by it,
and from that moment her defeat was assured. But as her heart and
mind were instinct with noble and generous feelings, she understood De
Guicheâ€™s extreme delicacy. She saw that in his heart he really suspected
that the king was in love with La Valliere, and that he did not wish
to resort to the common expedient of ruining a rival in the mind of
a woman, by giving the latter the assurance and certainty that this
rivalâ€™s affections were transferred to another woman. She guessed that
his suspicions of La Valliere were aroused, and that, in order to leave
himself time for his convictions to undergo a change, so as not to ruin
Louise utterly, he was determined to pursue a certain straightforward
line of conduct. She could read so much real greatness of character, and
such true generosity of disposition in her lover, that her heart really
warmed with affection towards him, whose passion for her was so pure and
delicate. Despite his fear of incurring her displeasure, De Guiche, by
retaining his position as a man of proud independence of feeling and
deep devotion, became almost a hero in her estimation, and reduced her
to the state of a jealous and little-minded woman. She loved him for
this so tenderly, that she could not refuse to give him a proof of her
affection.
NA
â€œsuspicions, anxieties, mistrust, sufferings--I think we have enumerated
NA
NA
â€œEfface them from your heart as I drive them from mine. Whether La
Valliere does or does not love the king, and whether the king does
or does not love La Valliere--from this moment you and I will draw a
distinction in the two characters I have to perform. You open your eyes

â€œYou are so impetuous, Madame, that I always tremble at the fear of

kingâ€™s wife. In this character ought I not to take an interest in these

â€œAgreed, monsieur; but it is a question of dignity; and then, you

behind the tapestry, and Mademoiselle de Montalais appeared.
NA
NA
the agitation of the actors of these four characters; for De Guiche had
consistently carried out his part with heroism.
Chapter XI. Montalais and Malicorne.
Montalais was right. M. de Guiche, thus summoned in every direction, was
very much exposed, from such a multiplication of business, to the
risk of not attending to any. It so happened that, considering the
awkwardness of the interruption, Madame, notwithstanding her wounded
pride, and secret anger, could not, for the moment at least, reproach
Montalais for having violated, in so bold a manner, the semi-royal order
with which she had been dismissed on De Guicheâ€™s entrance. De Guiche,
also, lost his presence of mind, or, it would be more correct to say,
had already lost it, before Montalaisâ€™s arrival, for, scarcely had he
heard the young girlâ€™s voice, than, without taking leave of Madame, as
the most ordinary politeness required, even between persons equal in
rank and station, he fled from her presence, his heart tumultuously
throbbing, and his brain on fire, leaving the princess with one hand
raised, as though to bid him adieu. Montalais was at no loss, therefore,
to perceive the agitation of the two lovers--the one who fled was
agitated, and the one who remained was equally so.
NA
â€œthis time, at least, I think I know as much as the most curious
NA
inquisitorial look, that, as if she heard Montalaisâ€™s muttered side
remark, she did not speak a word to her maid of honor, but, casting down
her eyes, retired at once to her bedroom. Montalais, observing this,
stood listening for a moment, and then heard Madame lock and bolt her
door. By this she knew that the rest of the evening was at her own
disposal; and making, behind the door which had just been closed, a
gesture which indicated but little real respect for the princess, she
went down the staircase in search of Malicorne, who was very busily

of the contract being agreed on.
The window just opened was, in fact, that of the Comte de Guiche. It
was not alone with the hope of catching a glimpse of Madame through her
curtains that he seated himself by the open window for his preoccupation
of mind had at that time a different origin. He had just received, as
we have already stated, the courier who had been dispatched to him by
Bragelonne, the latter having written to De Guiche a letter which had
made the deepest impression upon him, and which he had read over and
NA
NA
window in order to approach nearer to the light, he once more read the
letter he had just received:--
â€œCALAIS.
â€œMY DEAR COUNT,--I found M. de Wardes at Calais; he has been
seriously wounded in an affair with the Duke of Buckingham. De Wardes
is, as you know, unquestionably brave, but full of malevolent and wicked
feelings. He conversed with me about yourself, for whom, he says, he
has a warm regard, also about Madame, whom he considers a beautiful and
amiable woman. He has guessed your affection for a certain person. He
also talked to me about the lady for whom I have so ardent a regard, and
showed the greatest interest on my behalf in expressing a deep pity for
me, accompanied, however, by dark hints which alarmed me at first, but
which I at last looked upon as the result of his usual love of mystery.
These are the facts: he had received news of the court; you will
understand, however, that it was only through M. de Lorraine. The report
goes, so says the news, that a change has taken place in the kingâ€™s
affections. You know whom that concerns. Afterwards, the news continues,
people are talking about one of the maids of honor, respecting whom
various slanderous reports are being circulated. These vague phrases
have not allowed me to sleep. I have been deploring, ever
since yesterday, that my diffidence and vacillation of purpose,
notwithstanding a certain obstinacy of character I may possess, have
left me unable to reply to these insinuations. In a word, M. de Wardes
was setting off for Paris, and I did not delay his departure with
explanations; for it seemed rather hard, I confess, to cross-examine a
man whose wounds are hardly yet closed. In short, he travelled by short
stages, as he was anxious to leave, he said, in order to be present at a
curious spectacle the court cannot fail to offer within a short time.
He added a few congratulatory words accompanied by vague sympathizing
expressions. I could not understand the one any more than the other. I
was bewildered by my own thoughts, and tormented by a mistrust of this
man,--a mistrust which, you know better than any one else, I have never
been able to overcome. As soon as he left, my perceptions seemed
to become clearer. It is hardly possible that a man of De Wardesâ€™s
character should not have communicated something of his own malicious
nature to the statements he made to me. It is not unlikely, therefore,
that in the strange hints De Wardes threw out in my presence, there may
be a mysterious signification, which I might have some difficulty in
applying either to myself or to some one with whom you are acquainted.
Being compelled to leave as soon as possible, in obedience to the kingâ€™s
commands, the idea did not occur to me of running after De Wardes in
order to ask him to explain his reserve; but I have dispatched a courier
to you with this letter, which will explain in detail my various doubts.
I regard you as myself; you have reflected and observed; it will be for
you to act. M. de Wardes will arrive very shortly; endeavor to learn
what he meant, if you do not already know. M. de Wardes, moreover,
pretended that the Duke of Buckingham left Paris on the very best of
terms with Madame. This was an affair which would have unhesitatingly
made me draw my sword, had I not felt that I was under the necessity
of dispatching the kingâ€™s mission before undertaking any quarrel
whatsoever. Burn this letter, which Olivain will hand you. Whatever
Olivain says, you may confidently rely on. Will you have the goodness,
my dear comte, to recall me to the remembrance of Mademoiselle de la
Valliere, whose hands I kiss with the greatest respect.
â€œYour devoted
â€œDE BRAGELONNE.
â€œP. S.--If anything serious should happen--we should be prepared for
everything, dispatch a courier to me with this one single word, â€˜come,â€™
and I will be in Paris within six and thirty hours after the receipt of
NA
De Guiche sighed, folded up the letter a third time, and, instead of
burning it, as Raoul had recommended him to do, placed it in his pocket.
He felt it needed reading over and over again.
NA
 murmured the comte; â€œhe has poured out his whole soul in this letter.
He says nothing of the Comte de la Fere, and speaks of his respect for

 continued De Guiche, with a threatening gesture, â€œyou interfere in my
affairs, Monsieur de Wardes, do you? Very well, then; I will shortly
occupy myself with yours. As for you, poor Raoul,--you who intrust your
NA
With this promise, De Guiche begged Malicorne to come immediately to his
apartments, if possible. Malicorne acknowledged the invitation with an
activity which was the first result of his conversation with Montalais.
And while De Guiche, who thought that his motive was undiscovered,
cross-examined Malicorne, the latter, who appeared to be working in the
dark, soon guessed his questionerâ€™s motives. The consequence was,
that, after a quarter of an hourâ€™s conversation, during which De Guiche
thought he had ascertained the whole truth with regard to La Valliere
and the king, he had learned absolutely nothing more than his own eyes
had already acquainted him with, while Malicorne learned, or guessed,
that Raoul, who was absent, was fast becoming suspicious, and that De
Guiche intended to watch over the treasure of the Hesperides. Malicorne
accepted the office of dragon. De Guiche fancied he had done everything
for his friend, and soon began to think of nothing but his personal
affairs. The next evening, De Wardesâ€™s return and first appearance at
the kingâ€™s reception were announced. When that visit had been paid, the
convalescent waited on Monsieur; De Guiche taking care, however, to be
at Monsieurâ€™s apartments before the visit took place.
Chapter XII. How De Wardes Was Received at Court.
Monsieur had received De Wardes with that marked favor light and
frivolous minds bestow on every novelty that comes in their way. De
Wardes, who had been absent for a month, was like fresh fruit to him.
To treat him with marked kindness was an infidelity to old friends, and
there is always something fascinating in that; moreover, it was a sort
of reparation to De Wardes himself. Nothing, consequently, could exceed
the favorable notice Monsieur took of him. The Chevalier de Lorraine,
who feared this rival but a little, but who respected a character and
disposition only too parallel to his own in every particular, with the
addition of a bull-dog courage he did not himself possess, received De
Wardes with a greater display of regard and affection than even Monsieur
had done. De Guiche, as we have said, was there also, but kept in the
background, waiting very patiently until all these interchanges were
over. De Wardes, while talking to the others, and even to Monsieur
himself, had not for a moment lost sight of De Guiche, who, he
instinctively felt, was there on his account. As soon as he had finished
with the others, he went up to De Guiche. They exchanged the most
courteous compliments, after which De Wardes returned to Monsieur and
the other gentlemen.
In the midst of these congratulations Madame was announced. She had
been informed of De Wardesâ€™s arrival, and knowing all the details of his
voyage and duel, she was not sorry to be present at the remarks she
knew would be made, without delay, by one who, she felt assured, was her
personal enemy. Two or three of her ladies accompanied her. De Wardes
saluted Madame in the most graceful and respectful manner, and, as a
commencement of hostilities, announced, in the first place, that he
could furnish the Duke of Buckinghamâ€™s friends with the latest news
about him. This was a direct answer to the coldness with which Madame
had received him. The attack was a vigorous one, and Madame felt the
blow, but without appearing to have even noticed it. He rapidly cast a
glance at Monsieur and at De Guiche,--the former colored, and the latter
turned very pale. Madame alone preserved an unmoved countenance; but,
as she knew how many unpleasant thoughts and feelings her enemy could
awaken in the two persons who were listening to him, she smilingly
bent forward towards the traveler, as if to listen to the news he had
brought--but he was speaking of other matters. Madame was brave, even to
imprudence; if she were to retreat, it would be inviting an attack; so,
after the first disagreeable impression had passed away, she returned to
the charge.
NA
inquired, â€œfor we have been told that you had the misfortune to get

It was now De Wardesâ€™s turn to wince; he bit his lips, and replied, â€œNo,
NA
NA
â€œThe sea-breezes were very fresh and cool, Madame, and then I had one
NA
NA
â€œThe knowledge that my adversaryâ€™s sufferings were still greater than my
NA
â€œAh! you mean he was more seriously wounded than you were; I was not
NA
â€œOh, Madame, you are mistaken, or rather you pretend to misunderstand
my remark. I did not say that he was a greater sufferer in body than
NA
De Guiche comprehended instinctively from what direction the struggle
was approaching; he ventured to make a sign to Madame, as if entreating
her to retire from the contest. But she, without acknowledging De
Guicheâ€™s gesture, without pretending to have noticed it even, and still
smiling, continued:
NA
NA
NA
and it is this belief that gives them that superiority to man which
NA
NA
â€œM. de Wardes means that the Duke of Buckinghamâ€™s heart had been
NA
NA
Wardesâ€™s. Very good; but I should like to know if the Duke of Buckingham
would appreciate the jest. It is, indeed, a very great pity he is not
NA
NA
NA
De Guiche did not move. Madame seemed to expect that he would come to
her assistance. Monsieur hesitated. The Chevalier de Lorraine advanced
and continued the conversation.
NA
Buckinghamâ€™s heart to be touched is nothing new, and what he has said
NA
NA
NA
conversation. To change the conversation is, as every one knows, a
right possessed by princes which etiquette requires all to respect. The
remainder of the conversation was moderate enough in tone; the principal
actors had rehearsed their parts. Madame withdrew easily, and Monsieur,
who wished to question her on several matters, offered her his hand on
leaving. The chevalier was seriously afraid that an understanding might
be established between the husband and wife if he were to leave them
quietly together. He therefore made his way to Monsieurâ€™s apartments, in
order to surprise him on his return, and to destroy with a few words all
the good impressions Madame might have been able to sow in his heart. De
Guiche advanced towards De Wardes, who was surrounded by a large number
of persons, and thereby indicated his wish to converse with him; De
Wardes, at the same time, showing by his looks and by a movement of his
head that he perfectly understood him. There was nothing in these signs
to enable strangers to suppose they were otherwise than upon the most
friendly footing. De Guiche could therefore turn away from him, and wait
until he was at liberty. He had not long to wait; for De Wardes,
freed from his questioners, approached De Guiche, and after a fresh
salutation, they walked side by side together.
NA
 said the comte.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhy not? Everything is so ridiculous in this world, everything so
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œBut, tell me, you surely must have seen some people at Boulogne, one of
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWho was on his way to fulfil a mission, with which he was intrusted to

NA
â€œI do not precisely know what I told him, I must confess: but I do know
NA
perfectly well knew from De Guicheâ€™s tone and manner, which was cold
and dignified, that the conversation was about to assume a disagreeable
turn. He resolved to let it take what course it pleased, and to keep
strictly on his guard.
NA
NA
â€œLa Valliere... What is it? and what was that strange circumstance you
seem to have known over yonder, which Bragelonne, who was here on the

NA
NA
â€œWhat! you, a member of the court, living in Madameâ€™s household, a
friend of Monsieurâ€™s, a guest at their table, the favorite of our lovely
NA
Guiche colored violently from anger. â€œWhat princess are you alluding
NA
â€œI am only acquainted with one, my dear fellow. I am speaking of Madame
NA
De Guiche was on the point of launching out, but he saw the drift of
the remark. A quarrel was imminent between the two young men. De Wardes
wished the quarrel to be only in Madameâ€™s name, while De Guiche would
not accept it except on La Valliereâ€™s account. From this moment, it
became a series of feigned attacks, which would have continued until one
of the two had been touched home. De Guiche therefore resumed all the
self-possession he could command.
â€œThere is not the slightest question in the world of Madame in this

NA
NA
NA
NA

â€œIf you tell me what they are, I shall know, but not otherwise, I

â€œWhat! I who have just arrived from a distance of sixty leagues, and you
who have not stirred from this place, who have witnessed with your
own eyes that which rumor informed me of at Calais! Do you now tell
me seriously that you do not know what it is about? Oh! comte, this is
NA
NA
NA
â€œAnd so you will not tell me anything, will not tell me any more than

NA
â€œNo; but understand me, Guiche, that however much I may be ignorant of
certain matters, I am quite as conversant with others. If, for instance,
we were conversing about the intimacies of the Duke of Buckingham at
Paris, as I did during my journey with the duke, I could tell you a
great many interesting circumstances. Would you like me to mention
NA
De Guiche passed his hand across his forehead, which was covered

curiosity for matters which do not concern me. The Duke of Buckingham
is for me nothing more than a simple acquaintance, whilst Raoul is
an intimate friend. I have not the slightest curiosity to learn what
happened to the duke, while I have, on the contrary, the greatest

NA
â€œYes, in Paris, or Boulogne. You understand I am on the spot; if
anything should happen, I am here to meet it; whilst Raoul is absent,
and has only myself to represent him; so, Raoulâ€™s affairs before my

â€œThink so, indeed! do you suppose he was sent to London for no other
purpose than to go there and return again immediately? No, no; he was

De Wardes resumed his former coldness of manner: his love of raillery
had led him too far, and by his own imprudence, he had laid himself open
to attack.
NA
â€œHe told me that you had artfully insinuated some injurious remarks
against La Valliere, and that you had seemed to laugh at his great

every man expects from another whenever anything may have been said

the greatest preference for the Duke of Buckingham, is at this moment

â€œI admit that, but if I absolutely wished to quarrel with you, I should
try and invent a falsehood, perhaps, and speak to you about a certain

speak also of certain gratifications, of certain kissings of the hand;
NA
NA
although he almost felt as if he were going to die; â€œI swear I should
not care for that, nor should I in any way contradict you; for you must
know, my dear marquis, that for all matters which concern myself I am a
block of ice; but it is a very different thing when an absent friend
is concerned, a friend, who, on leaving, confided his interests to my
safe-keeping; for such a friend, De Wardes, believe me, I am like fire

â€œI understand you, Monsieur de Guiche. In spite of what you say, there
cannot be any question between us, just now, either of Bragelonne or of

At this moment some of the younger courtiers were crossing the
apartment, and having already heard the few words which had just been
pronounced, were able also to hear those which were about to follow. De
Wardes observed this, and continued aloud:--â€œOh! if La Valliere were a
coquette like Madame, whose innocent flirtations, I am sure, were, first
of all, the cause of the Duke of Buckingham being sent back to England,
and afterwards were the reason of your being sent into exile; for you
will not deny, I suppose, that Madameâ€™s pretty ways really had a certain

The courtiers drew nearer to the speakers, Saint-Aignan at their head,
and then Manicamp.
NA
â€œI am a vain, conceited fellow, I know, and everybody else knows it too.
I took seriously that which was only intended as a jest, and got myself
exiled for my pains. But I saw my error. I overcame my vanity, and I
obtained my recall, by making the _amende honorable_, and by promising
myself to overcome this defect; and the consequence is, that I am so
thoroughly cured, that I now laugh at the very thing which, three or
four days ago, would have almost broken my heart. But Raoul is in love,
and is loved in return; he cannot laugh at the reports which disturb his
happiness--reports which you seem to have undertaken to interpret, when
you know, marquis, as I do, as these gentlemen do, as every one does in

me, if what you reported about this young girl is true or not. Do you

De Wardes looked round him, to see if he could find support from any
one; but, at the idea that De Wardes had insulted, either directly or
indirectly, the idol of the day, every one shook his head; and De Wardes
saw that he was in the wrong.

It was the very thing the courtiers wished; some went out at one door,

the country, while the command you have acquired over yourself, comte,

Chapter XIII. The Combat.
De Wardes and De Guiche selected their horses, and saddled them with
their own hands, with holster saddles. De Guiche, having two pairs of
pistols, went to his apartments to get them; and after having loaded
them, gave the choice to De Wardes, who selected the pair he had made
use of twenty times before--the same, indeed, with which De Guiche had

assisted De Wardes to mount his horse.

De Guiche reflected for a moment; and the thought which had already
presented itself to him became more confirmed--that De Wardes wished to
have witnesses present, in order to bring back the conversation about
Madame, and to give a new turn to the combat. He avoided saying a
word in reply, therefore; and, as De Wardes once more looked at him
interrogatively, he replied, by a movement of the head, that it would be
best to let things remain as they were. The two adversaries consequently
set off, and left the chateau by the same gate, close to which we may
remember to have seen Montalais and Malicorne together. The night, as
if to counteract the extreme heat of the day, had gathered the clouds
together in masses which were moving slowly along from the west to the
east. The vault above, without a clear spot anywhere visible, or without
the faintest indication of thunder, seemed to hang heavily over
the earth, and soon began, by the force of the wind, to split into
streamers, like a huge sheet torn to shreds. Large and warm drops of
rain began to fall heavily, and gathered the dust into globules, which
rolled along the ground. At the same time, the hedges, which seemed
conscious of the approaching storm, the thirsty plants, the drooping
branches of the trees, exhaled a thousand aromatic odors, which revived
in the mind tender recollections, thoughts of youth, endless life,

really worth while, tell me, to throw this affair of Bragelonneâ€™s on my
shoulders? But, take care, my dear fellow; in bringing the wild boar to

with the ferocity of the jaguar. The consequence is, that brought to bay

place, as a beginning, you will readily suppose that I have not been
absurd enough to lock up my secret, or your secret rather, in my own
breast. There is a friend of mine, who resembles me in every way, a
man whom you know very well, who shares my secret with me; so, pray
understand, that if you kill me, my death will not have been of much
service to you; whilst, on the contrary, if I kill you--and everything

its sound, that a superstitious man would have been terrified. But De

wide open space, and took his stand at that point of the circumference
of the cross-road immediately opposite to where De Guiche was stationed.
De Guiche remained motionless. At this distance of a hundred paces,
the two adversaries were absolutely invisible to each other, being
completely concealed by the thick shade of elms and chestnuts. A minute
elapsed amidst the profoundest silence. At the end of the minute, each
of them, in the deep shade in which he was concealed, heard the double
click of the trigger, as they put the pistols on full cock. De Guiche,
adopting the usual tactics, put his horse to a gallop, persuaded that he
should render his safety doubly sure by the movement, as well as by the
speed of the animal. He directed his course in a straight line towards
the point where, in his opinion, De Wardes would be stationed; and he
expected to meet De Wardes about half-way; but in this he was mistaken.
He continued his course, presuming that his adversary was impatiently
awaiting his approach. When, however, he had gone about two-thirds of
the distance, he beheld the trees suddenly illuminated and a ball flew
by, cutting the plume of his hat in two. Nearly at the same moment, and
as if the flash of the first shot had served to indicate the direction
of the other, a second report was heard, and a second ball passed
through the head of De Guicheâ€™s horse, a little below the ear. The
animal fell. These two reports, proceeding from the very opposite
direction in which he expected to find De Wardes, surprised him a
great deal; but as he was a man of amazing self-possession, he prepared
himself for his horse falling, but not so completely, however, that the
toe of his boot escaped being caught under the animal as it fell. Very
fortunately the horse in its dying agonies moved so as to enable him to
release the leg which was less entangled than the other. De Guiche rose,
felt himself all over, and found that he was not wounded. At the very
moment he had felt the horse tottering under him, he placed his pistols
in the holsters, afraid that the force of the fall might explode one at
least, if not both of them, by which he would have been disarmed, and
left utterly without defense. Once on his feet, he took the pistols out
of the holsters, and advanced towards the spot where, by the light of
the flash, he had seen De Wardes appear. De Wardes had, at the first
shot, accounted for the maneuver, than which nothing could have been
simpler. Instead of advancing to meet De Guiche, or remaining in his
place to await his approach, De Wardes had, for about fifteen paces,
followed the circle of the shadow which hid him from his adversaryâ€™s
observation, and at the very moment when the latter presented his flank
in his career, he had fired from the place where he stood, carefully
taking aim, and assisted instead of being inconvenienced by the horseâ€™s
gallop. It has been seen that, notwithstanding the darkness, the first
ball passed hardly more than an inch above De Guicheâ€™s head. De Wardes
had so confidently relied upon his aim, that he thought he had seen De
Guiche fall; his astonishment was extreme when he saw he still remained
erect in his saddle. He hastened to fire his second shot, but his hand
trembled, and he killed the horse instead. It would be a most fortunate
chance for him if De Guiche were to remain held fast under the animal.
Before he could have freed himself, De Wardes would have loaded his
pistol and had De Guiche at his mercy. But De Guiche, on the contrary,
was up, and had three shots to fire. De Guiche immediately understood
the position of affairs. It would be necessary to exceed De Wardes in
rapidity of execution. He advanced, therefore, so as to reach him
before he should have had time to reload his pistol. De Wardes saw him
approaching like a tempest. The ball was rather tight, and offered some
resistance to the ramrod. To load carelessly would be simply to lose
his last chance; to take the proper care in loading meant fatal loss of
time, or rather, throwing away his life. He made his horse bound on
one side. De Guiche turned round also, and, at the moment the horse was
quiet again, fired, and the ball carried off De Wardesâ€™s hat from
his head. De Wardes now knew that he had a momentâ€™s time at his own
disposal; he availed himself of it in order to finish loading his
pistol. De Guiche, noticing that his adversary did not fall, threw the
pistol he had just discharged aside, and walked straight towards
De Wardes, elevating the second pistol as he did so. He had hardly
proceeded more than two or three paces, when De Wardes took aim at him
as he was walking, and fired. An exclamation of anger was De Guicheâ€™s
answer; the comteâ€™s arm contracted and dropped motionless by his side,
and the pistol fell from his grasp. His anxiety was excessive. â€œI am
NA
moment, however, De Guiche was about to raise his pistol against De
Wardes, the head, shoulders, and limbs of the comte seemed to collapse.
He heaved a deep-drawn sigh, tottered, and fell at the feet of De
Wardesâ€™s horse.
NA
struck his spurs into the horseâ€™s sides. The horse cleared the comteâ€™s
motionless body, and bore De Wardes rapidly back to the chateau. When
he arrived there, he remained a quarter of an hour deliberating within
himself as to the proper course to be adopted. In his impatience to
leave the field of battle, he had omitted to ascertain whether De Guiche
were dead or not. A double hypothesis presented itself to De Wardesâ€™s
agitated mind; either De Guiche was killed, or De Guiche was wounded
only. If he were killed, why should he leave his body in that manner to
the tender mercies of the wolves; it was a perfectly useless piece of
cruelty, for if De Guiche were dead, he certainly could not breathe a
syllable of what had passed; if he were not killed, why should he, De
Wardes, in leaving him there uncared for, allow himself to be regarded
as a savage, incapable of one generous feeling? This last consideration
determined his line of conduct.
De Wardes immediately instituted inquires after Manicamp. He was told
that Manicamp had been looking after De Guiche, and, not knowing where
to find him, had retired to bed. De Wardes went and awoke the sleeper,
without any delay, and related the whole affair to him, which Manicamp
listened to in perfect silence, but with an expression of momentarily
increasing energy, of which his face could hardly have been supposed
capable. It was only when De Wardes had finished, that Manicamp uttered
NA
As they proceeded, Manicamp became more and more excited, and in
proportion as De Wardes related the details of the affair to him, his

NA

NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œA little. But I shall doubt it more than ever, I warn you, if I find

NA
â€œJust as you please. The fact is, I never did like people who come and
say, â€˜I have killed such and such a gentleman in a corner; it is a great
pity, but I killed him in a perfectly honorable manner.â€™ It has an ugly

NA
In fact, the glade could now be seen, and in the open space lay the
motionless body of the dead horse. To the right of the horse, upon the
dark grass, with his face against the ground, the poor comte lay, bathed
in his blood. He had remained in the same spot, and did not even seem to
have made the slightest movement. Manicamp threw himself on his knees,
lifted the comte in his arms, and found him quite cold, and steeped in
blood. He let him gently fall again. Then, stretching out his hand and
feeling all over the ground close to where the comte lay, he sought
until he found De Guicheâ€™s pistol.

â€œBut I told you that I took aim as he was walking towards me, and fired

â€œAre you quite sure that you fought with him, Monsieur de Wardes? I
confess that I am very much afraid it has been a foul assassination.
Nay, nay, no exclamations! You have had your three shots, and his pistol
is still loaded. You have killed his horse, and he, De Guiche, one of
the best marksmen in France, has not touched even either your horse
or yourself. Well, Monsieur de Wardes, you have been very unlucky in
bringing me here; all the blood in my body seems to have mounted to my
head; and I verily believe that since so good an opportunity presents
itself, I shall blow your brains out on the spot. So, Monsieur de

And Manicamp slowly raised his pistol to the height of De Wardesâ€™s
breast, and with arm stretched out, and a fixed, determined look on his
face, took a careful aim.
De Wardes did not attempt a flight; he was completely terrified. In the
midst, however, of this horrible silence, which lasted about a second,
but which seemed an age to De Wardes, a faint sigh was heard.
NA
NA
Manicamp fell back a step or two, and the two young men saw the comte
raise himself slowly and painfully upon one hand. Manicamp threw the
pistol away a dozen paces, and ran to his friend, uttering a cry of
delight. De Wardes wiped his forehead, which was covered with a cold
perspiration.

NA

De Guiche showed him his mutilated hand and his chest covered with
blood.

you please; or, if you are in a hurry, we can do better still; let
us stanch the blood from the comteâ€™s wounds here, with your
pocket-handkerchief and mine, and then, as there are two shots left, we

NA
death too close at hand to be agreeable; I donâ€™t like his look at all,

Manicamp burst out laughing, and Guiche, too, in spite of his
sufferings. The two young men wished to carry him, but he declared
he felt quite strong enough to walk alone. The ball had broken his
ring-finger and his little finger, and then had glanced along his side,
but without penetrating deeply into his chest. It was the pain rather
than the seriousness of the wound, therefore, which had overcome De
Guiche. Manicamp passed his arm under one of the countâ€™s shoulders, and
De Wardes did the same with the other, and in this way they brought
him back to Fontainebleau, to the house of the same doctor who had been
present at the death of the Franciscan, Aramisâ€™s predecessor.
Chapter XIV. The Kingâ€™s Supper.
The king, while these matters were being arranged, was sitting at the
supper-table, and the not very large number of guests for that day had
taken their seats too, after the usual gesture intimating the royal
permission. At this period of Louis XIV.â€™s reign, although etiquette was
not governed by the strict regulations subsequently adopted, the French
court had entirely thrown aside the traditions of good-fellowship and
patriarchal affability existing in the time of Henry IV., which the
suspicious mind of Louis XIII. had gradually replaced with pompous state
and ceremony, which he despaired of being able fully to realize.
The king, therefore, was seated alone at a small separate table, which,
like the desk of a president, overlooked the adjoining tables. Although
we say a small table, we must not omit to add that this small table was
the largest one there. Moreover, it was the one on which were placed the
greatest number and quantity of dishes, consisting of fish, game, meat,
fruit, vegetables, and preserves. The king was young and full of vigor
and energy, very fond of hunting, addicted to all violent exercises
of the body, possessing, besides, like all the members of the Bourbon
family, a rapid digestion and an appetite speedily renewed. Louis XIV.
was a formidable table-companion; he delighted in criticising his cooks;
but when he honored them by praise and commendation, the honor was
overwhelming. The king began by eating several kinds of soup, either
mixed together or taken separately. He intermixed, or rather separated,
each of the soups by a glass of old wine. He ate quickly and somewhat
greedily. Porthos, who from the beginning had, out of respect, been
waiting for a jog of Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s arm, seeing the king make such rapid
progress, turned to the musketeer and said in a low voice:
â€œIt seems as if one might go on now; his majesty is very encouraging,
NA
NA
and manage matters in such a manner that, if he should happen to address
a remark to you, he will not find you with your mouth full--which would

well, eats well,â€™ and he does not like people to eat indifferently at

NA
NA

NA
NA
certain well-bred enthusiasm.
The king occasionally looked at the different persons who were at
table with him, and, _en connoisseur_, could appreciate the different
dispositions of his guests.
NA
Porthos was enjoying a _salmi de lievre_, and swallowed half of the
back. His name, pronounced in such a manner, made him start, and by a
vigorous effort of his gullet he absorbed the whole mouthful.
NA
intelligible, nevertheless.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
which the king apparently received with great satisfaction.
NA
tete-a-tete_ a guest who could eat as Porthos did. Porthos received the
dish of lamb, and put a portion of it on his plate.
NA
NA
â€œHave you as good mutton in your part of the country, Monsieur du
NA
â€œSire, I believe that from my own province, as everywhere else, the best
of everything is sent to Paris for your majestyâ€™s use; but, on the other

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œIn this, sire: my cook, who is a German, first stuffs the lamb in
question with small sausages he procures from Strasburg, force-meat
balls from Troyes, and larks from Pithiviers; by some means or other,
which I am not acquainted with, he bones the lamb as he would do a fowl,
leaving the skin on, however, which forms a brown crust all over the
animal; when it is cut in beautiful slices, in the same way as an
enormous sausage, a rose-colored gravy pours forth, which is as
NA
finished by smacking his lips.
The king opened his eyes with delight, and, while cutting some of the
_faisan en daube_, which was being handed to him, he said:
â€œThat is a dish I should very much like to taste, Monsieur du Vallon. Is

The order was immediately obeyed. Then, continuing the conversation, he

The king had now arrived at the _entrements_, but without losing sight
of Porthos, who continued to play his part in the best manner.

we would both of us eat our lamb together; for your appetite is not an

NA
NA
NA
In fact it was not long before it came to the boarâ€™s turn, for the king
seemed to take pleasure in urging on his guest; he did not pass any
of the dishes to Porthos until he had tasted them himself, and he
accordingly took some of the boarâ€™s head. Porthos showed that he could
keep pace with his sovereign; and, instead of eating the half, as
NA
 said the king in an undertone, â€œthat a gentleman who eats so good a
supper every day, and who has such beautiful teeth, can be otherwise

NA
NA
his chair.
NA
The king and Porthos continued to eat in the same manner, to the great
satisfaction of the other guests, some of whom, from emulation, had
attempted to follow them, but were obliged to give up half-way. The
king soon began to get flushed and the reaction of the blood to his face
announced that the moment of repletion had arrived. It was then that
Louis XIV., instead of becoming gay and cheerful, as most good livers
generally do, became dull, melancholy, and taciturn. Porthos, on the
contrary, was lively and communicative. Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s foot had more than
once to remind him of this peculiarity of the king. The dessert now
made its appearance. The king had ceased to think anything further of
Porthos; he turned his eyes anxiously towards the entrance-door, and
he was heard occasionally to inquire how it happened that Monsieur de
Saint-Aignan was so long in arriving. At last, at the moment when
his majesty was finishing a pot of preserved plums with a deep sigh,
Saint-Aignan appeared. The kingâ€™s eyes, which had become somewhat dull,
immediately began to sparkle. The comte advanced towards the kingâ€™s
table, and Louis rose at his approach. Everybody got up at the same
time, including Porthos, who was just finishing an almond-cake capable
of making the jaws of a crocodile stick together. The supper was over.
Chapter XV. After Supper.
The king took Saint-Aignan by the arm, and passed into the adjoining

NA
â€œSire, your majesty deigned to write in verse, and Mademoiselle de la
Valliere wished to repay your majesty in the same coin; that is to say,

NA
NA
verses which history has preserved entire for us, and which are more
meritorious in invention than in execution. Such as they were, however,
the king was enchanted with them, and exhibited his satisfaction by
unequivocal transports of delight; but the universal silence which
reigned in the rooms warned Louis, so sensitively particular with
regard to good breeding, that his delight must give rise to various
interpretations. He turned aside and put the note in his pocket, and
then advancing a few steps, which brought him again to the threshold of
the door close to his guests, he said, â€œM. du Vallon, I have seen you

The apartment was immediately cleared of the guests. The king took
Saint-Aignan by the arm, made him read La Valliereâ€™s verses over again,

Chapter XVI. Showing in What Way Dâ€™Artagnan Discharged the Mission with
Which the King Had Intrusted Him.
While the king was engaged in making these last-mentioned arrangements
in order to ascertain the truth, Dâ€™Artagnan, without losing a second,
ran to the stable, took down the lantern, saddled his horse himself, and
proceeded towards the place his majesty had indicated. According to
the promise he had made, he had not accosted any one; and, as we have
observed, he had carried his scruples so far as to do without the
assistance of the stable-helpers altogether. Dâ€™Artagnan was one of those
who in moments of difficulty pride themselves on increasing their own
value. By dint of hard galloping, he in less than five minutes
reached the wood, fastened his horse to the first tree he came to, and
penetrated to the broad open space on foot. He then began to inspect
most carefully, on foot and with his lantern in his hand, the whole
surface of the Rond-point, went forward, turned back again, measured,
examined, and after half an hourâ€™s minute inspection, he returned
silently to where he had left his horse, and pursued his way in deep
reflection and at a foot-pace to Fontainebleau. Louis was waiting in his
cabinet; he was alone, and with a pencil was scribbling on paper certain
lines which Dâ€™Artagnan at the first glance recognized as unequal and
very much touched up. The conclusion he arrived at was, that they must
be verses. The king raised his head and perceived Dâ€™Artagnan. â€œWell,

NA

â€œI will approach it as near as I possibly can. The weather was very well

NA
â€œSire, your majesty told me that there was a horse lying dead in the
cross-road of the Bois-Rochin, and I began, therefore, by studying the
roads. I say the roads, because the center of the cross-road is reached
by four separate roads. The one that I myself took was the only one that
presented any fresh traces. Two horses had followed it side by side;
their eight feet were marked very distinctly in the clay. One of the
riders was more impatient than the other, for the footprints of the one

NA
â€œYes sire. The horses are two rather large animals of equal
pace,--horses well used to maneuvers of all kinds, for they wheeled

NA
â€œThe two cavaliers paused there for a minute, no doubt to arrange the
conditions of the engagement; the horses grew restless and impatient.
One of the riders spoke, while the other listened and seemed to have
contented himself by simply answering. His horse pawed the ground, which
proves that his attention was so taken up by listening that he let the

NA
NA
NA
â€œOne of the two cavaliers remained where he was standing, the one, in
fact, who had been listening; the other crossed the open space, and at
first placed himself directly opposite to his adversary. The one who
had remained stationary traversed the Rond-point at a gallop, about
two-thirds of its length, thinking that by this means he would gain
upon his opponent; but the latter had followed the circumference of the

â€œCompletely so, sire. Only he who followed the circumference of the wood

â€œThe shot told terribly, sire; the dismounted cavalier fell upon his

NA
â€œIn two places; in the first place, in his right hand, and then, by the
NA
NA
admiration.
â€œBy a very simple means; the butt end of the pistol was covered with
blood, and the trace of the bullet could be observed, with fragments of
a broken ring. The wounded man, in all probability, had the ring-finger

NA
â€œSire, there were two small pools of blood, at a distance of about two
feet and a half from each other. At one of these pools of blood the
grass was torn up by the clenched hand; at the other, the grass was

in the same place; however, he was able to walk, as he left the spot,

NA
â€œNo; but I observed the footprints of three men; the one on the right
and the one on the left walked freely and easily, but the one in the
middle dragged his feet as he walked; besides, he left traces of blood
NA
â€œNow, monsieur, since you saw the combat so distinctly that not a single
detail seems to have escaped you, tell me something about De Guicheâ€™s
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, sire, I see everything; but I do not tell all I see; and, since
the poor devil has escaped, your majesty will permit me to say that I do
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œPerfectly, sire; but, according to my notions, a man who fights a duel
is a brave man; such, at least, is my own opinion; but your majesty may

Dâ€™Artagnan interrupted the king by a respectful gesture. â€œYou ordered
me, sire, to gather what particulars I could, respecting a hostile
meeting that had taken place; those particulars you have. If you order
me to arrest M. de Guicheâ€™s adversary, I will do so; but do not order me
NA
NA
NA
The king stamped his foot angrily; but after a momentâ€™s reflection, he
NA
â€œThat is my opinion, sire: I am happy that, this time, it accords with
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThere was no second, sire. Nay, more than that, when M. de Guiche fell,

â€œThe consequence of your ordinances, sire. If a man has fought well, and
fairly, and has already escaped one chance of death, he naturally wishes

NA
â€œA very evident proof, sire; at the moment the encounter took place,
the rain had just ceased, the ground had not had time to imbibe the
moisture, and was, consequently, soaked; the footsteps sank in the
ground; but while M. de Guiche was lying there in a fainting condition,
the ground became firm again, and the footsteps made a less sensible

Louis clapped his hands together in sign of admiration. â€œMonsieur

NA
â€œThe identical thing M. de Richelieu thought, and M. de Mazarin said,

â€œIn that case, you are not human, Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan, for I believe you
NA
â€œYour majesty said that we were going to see whether such was the case,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan shook his head. â€œNo one was present at the combat, I repeat;
NA
NA
NA
And, at the very same moment, Manicamp and Saint-Aignan appeared at the
threshold of the door.
Chapter XVII. The Encounter.
The king signified with an imperious gesture, first to the musketeer,
NA
like a sentinel, to a corner of the room; Saint-Aignan, in his character
of a favorite, leaned over the back of the kingâ€™s chair. Manicamp, with
his right foot properly advanced, a smile upon his lips, and his
white and well-formed hands gracefully disposed, advanced to make his
reverence to the king, who returned the salutation by a bow. â€œGood
NA
NA
â€œYes, in order to learn from you all the details of the unfortunate
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œBut you arrived on the scene of the accident, a few minutes after it
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œGood; give me all the details you are acquainted with, respecting this
NA
â€œPerhaps your majesty has already been informed of them, and I fear to
NA
NA
Manicamp looked round him; he saw only Dâ€™Artagnan leaning with his
back against the wainscot--Dâ€™Artagnan, calm, kind, and good-natured as
usual--and Saint-Aignan whom he had accompanied, and who still leaned
over the kingâ€™s armchair with an expression of countenance equally full
of good feeling. He determined, therefore, to speak out. â€œYour majesty
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The king paused for a moment before he said: â€œWhat animal was being
NA
NA
â€œAnd what could possibly have possessed De Guiche to go to a wild
boar-hunt by himself; that is but a clownish idea of sport, only fit for
that class of people who, unlike the Marechal de Gramont, have no dogs
NA
NA
sententiously.
NA
NA
and hasty, and letting his words fall very slowly one by one, â€œat all
NA
â€œQuite alone? indeed?--What a sportsman! And is not M. de Guiche aware
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou may as well tell me, monsieur, that De Guiche had some idea of
committing suicide; for I have seen him hunt, and he is an active and
vigorous hunter. Whenever he fires at an animal brought to bay and held
in check by the dogs, he takes every possible precaution, and yet he
fires with a carbine, and on this occasion he seems to have faced the
NA
Manicamp started.
â€œA costly pair of pistols, excellent weapons to fight a duel with a man
NA
NA
â€œYou are quite right, and the event which we are now discussing is
NA
During the recital, Saint-Aignan, who probably would have made a sign to
Manicamp to be careful what he was about, found that the kingâ€™s glance
was constantly fixed upon himself, so that it was utterly impossible to
communicate with Manicamp in any way. As for Dâ€™Artagnan, the statue of
Silence at Athens was far more noisy and far more expressive than he.
Manicamp, therefore, was obliged to continue in the same way he
had begun, and so contrived to get more and more entangled in his
NA
NA
NA
â€œOn horseback. He fired upon the brute and missed his aim, and then it
NA
NA
NA
â€œI have been told that a horse has been found lying dead in the
NA
NA
NA
â€œDe Guiche, once down, was attacked and worried by the wild boar, and
NA
â€œIt is a horrible accident, but it must be admitted it was De Guicheâ€™s
own fault. How could he possibly have gone to hunt such an animal merely
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Manicamp looked very uncomfortable and ill at ease.
NA
NA
â€œYes. How was it that you, who are De Guicheâ€™s intimate friend, and
who know that he is subject to such acts of folly, did not stop him in
NA
Manicamp no longer knew what to do; the tone in which the king spoke
was anything but that of a credulous man. On the other hand, it did
not indicate any particular severity, nor did he seem to care very
much about the cross-examination. There was more of raillery in it than
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo, sire; for your majesty will remember that, at the last hunt, M. de
NA
NA
NA
â€œHad Guicheâ€™s horse been ripped open like M. de Saint-Maureâ€™s horse, I
NA
Manicamp opened his eyes very wide.
NA
De Guicheâ€™s horse was struck? You must admit, Monsieur de Manicamp, that
NA
â€œYou are aware, sire, that the horse is a very intelligent animal, and
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œOh! I understand that perfectly, as far as the horse is concerned; but
NA
â€œWell! that, too, is simple enough; the boar left the horse and attacked
the rider; and, as I have already had the honor of informing your
majesty, shattered De Guicheâ€™s hand at the very moment he was about to
discharge his second pistol at him, and then, with a gouge of his tusk,
NA
â€œNothing is more likely; really, Monsieur de Manicamp, you are wrong in
placing so little confidence in your own eloquence, and you can tell a
NA
NA
most embarrassed manner.
â€œFrom this day henceforth, I will prohibit any gentleman attached to my
court going out to a similar encounter. Really, one might just as well

Manicamp started, and moved as if he were about to withdraw. â€œIs your

At this moment an usher lifted up the curtain before the door, and
announced the kingâ€™s physician.

degree discomposed.
Chapter XVIII. The Physician.
M. Valot entered. The position of the different persons present was
precisely the same: the king was seated, Saint-Aignan leaning over the
back of his armchair, Dâ€™Artagnan with his back against the wall, and
Manicamp still standing.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œBy a poacher, rather, or by a jealous husband, or an ill-used lover,
NA
â€œWhat is it that you say, Monsieur Valot? Were not M. de Guicheâ€™s wounds
NA
â€œM. de Guicheâ€™s wounds are the result of a pistol-bullet that broke
his ring-finger and the little finger of the right hand, and afterwards
NA
NA
 exclaimed the king, pretending to look much surprised.
NA
presented to the king a half-flattened bullet, which the king looked at,
but did not touch.
NA
â€œNot precisely. The ball did not penetrate, but was flattened, as you
see, either upon the trigger of the pistol or upon the right side of the
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhat does all this mean, then, this invention about hunting a wild boar

NA
NA
towards his captain of musketeers, â€œand that a duel actually took
NA
The king possessed, to a greater extent than any one else, the faculty
enjoyed by the great in power or position, of compromising and dividing
those beneath him. Manicamp darted a look full of reproaches at the
musketeer. Dâ€™Artagnan understood the look at once, and not wishing
to remain beneath the weight of such an accusation, advanced a step
forward, and said: â€œSire, your majesty commanded me to go and explore
the place where the cross-roads meet in the Bois-Rochin, and to report
to you, according to my own ideas, what had taken place there. I
submitted my observations to you, but without denouncing any one. It was
NA
NA
duty, and I am satisfied with you. But you, Monsieur de Manicamp, have
NA
NA
NA
â€œSire, I will not attempt to do so. I have already been unfortunate
enough to displease your majesty, and it will, in every respect, be far
better for me to accept most humbly any reproaches you may think proper
NA
â€œYou are right, monsieur, whoever conceals the truth from me, risks my
NA
NA
NA
Manicamp bowed and turned pale. Dâ€™Artagnan again made another step
forward, determined to interfere, if the still increasing anger of the
king attained certain limits.
NA
NA
â€œI do not deny it, sire, and it would have been truly generous on your
NA
NA
â€œSire, M. de Guiche is my friend. Your majesty has forbidden duels under
NA
NA
â€œInstead of telling a falsehood, monsieur, you should have prevented him
NA
â€œOh! sire, your majesty, who is the most accomplished gentleman in
France, knows quite as well as any of us other gentlemen that we have
never considered M. de Bouteville dishonored for having suffered death
on the Place de Greve. That which does in truth dishonor a man is to

NA
NA
â€œIf it be a means of which a gentleman may avail himself, I shall most
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Manicamp bowed very gracefully, unbuckled his sword, smiling as he did
so, and handed it for the musketeer to take. But Saint-Aignan advanced
NA
NA
NA
for some one to step between him and the wrath he felt he had carried
him too far.
â€œManicamp, you are a brave man, and the king will appreciate your
conduct; but to wish to serve your friends too well, is to destroy them.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThen I will tell it, for I am not so extremely sensitive on such points
NA
NA
â€œOh! a truce to magnanimity; I will not permit you to go to the Bastile
NA
Manicamp was keen-witted enough, and perfectly understood that he had
done quite sufficient to produce a good opinion of his conduct; it was
now only a question of persevering in such a manner as to regain the
NA
have on my own behalf done all that my conscience told me to do; and it
NA
â€œsince its mandates led me to disobey your majestyâ€™s commands; but your
majesty will forgive me, I hope, when you learn that I was anxious to

Manicamp bowed.

not complain of your having acted with so much circumspection; on the

a moment. I wish to be alone with M. de Manicamp; I know he has some
important communication to make for his own justification, and which
he will not venture before witnesses.... Put up your sword, M. de

Manicamp returned his sword to his belt.

which luckily passed unnoticed by the king.

Chapter XIX. Wherein Dâ€™Artagnan Perceives that It Was He Who Was
Mistaken, and Manicamp Who Was Right.
The king, determined to be satisfied that no one was listening, went
himself to the door, and then returned precipitately and placed himself
opposite Manicamp.
NA
NA
NA
is nothing to which I personally attach a greater importance than the
NA
â€œThat is the very reason, sire, why I endeavored to study your delicacy
NA
â€œYes, I understand it all now. You say that it was one of the maids of
honor of my sister-in-law who was the subject of dispute, and that the
person in question, De Guicheâ€™s adversary, the man, in point of fact,
NA
NA
â€œYes, you say, however, that this man insulted some one belonging to the

announcement had caused him a sudden pang; â€œah! it was Mademoiselle de

â€œI merely say that she was spoken of in terms far enough from

Manicamp perceived that they had returned to the question again. As for
the king, he saw he had allowed himself to be hurried away a little too
far, and therefore continued:--â€œAnd I will punish him--not because there
is any question of Mademoiselle de la Valliere, although I esteem her
very highly--but because a lady was the object of the quarrel. And I
intend that ladies shall be respected at my court, and that quarrels
NA
Manicamp bowed.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYour majesty can imagine the character of the jest in which young men
NA
NA
ventured to remark.
NA
â€œBut Mademoiselle de la Valliere has a perfect right to love any one she

NA
NA
NA
â€œWhy, the name of the man with whom La Valliere is in love, and whom De

â€œSire, I know nothing--I have heard nothing--and have learnt nothing,
even accidentally; but De Guiche is a noble-hearted fellow, and
if, momentarily, he substituted himself in the place or stead of La
Valliereâ€™s protector, it was because that protector was himself of too

These words were more than transparent; they made the king blush, but
this time with pleasure. He struck Manicamp gently on the shoulder.
â€œWell, well, Monsieur de Manicamp, you are not only a ready, witty
fellow, but a brave gentleman besides, and your friend De Guiche is a

NA
NA
NA
The king smiled and held out his hand to Manicamp, which he took and
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou told me in the most admirable manner the particulars of the
accident which happened to Guiche. I can see the wild boar rushing out
of the wood--I can see the horse fall down fighting with his head, and
the boar rush from the horse to the rider. You do not simply relate a

NA

laughing, Monsieur de Manicamp, that I wish you to relate this adventure

NA
â€œYes; in the same manner you told it to me, without changing a single

NA
â€œVery well! and now summon M. dâ€™Artagnan; I hope you are no longer

â€œOh, sire, from the very moment I am sure of your majestyâ€™s kind

Manicamp opened the door, and said, â€œGentlemen, the king wishes you to

Dâ€™Artagnan, Saint-Aignan, and Valot entered.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan glanced at Valot and Saint-Aignan, as much as to say, â€œWell!
NA
The king led Manicamp to the door, and then in a low tone of voice said:
â€œSee that M. de Guiche takes good care of himself, and particularly that
he recovers as soon as possible; I am very desirous of thanking him in
the name of every lady, but let him take special care that he does not

â€œWere he to die a hundred times, sire, he would begin again if your

This remark was direct enough. But we have already said that the incense
of flattery was very pleasing to the king, and, provided he received it,
he was not very particular as to its quality.

NA
the apartment, the king turned round towards the three spectators of
this scene, and said, â€œTell me, Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan, how does it happen
that your sight is so imperfect?--you, whose eyes are generally so very
NA
NA
NA
â€œIt must be the case since your majesty says so; but in what respect,
NA
NA
NA
â€œCertainly. You pretended to have seen the tracks of two horses, to have
detected the footprints of two men; and have described the particulars
of an engagement, which you assert took place. Nothing of the sort
NA
NA
â€œExactly the same thing with the galloping to and fro of the horses, and
the other indications of a struggle. It was the struggle of De Guiche
against the wild boar, and absolutely nothing else; only the struggle

NA
â€œAnd when I think that I almost believed it for a moment--but, then, you

NA
Dâ€™Artagnan, with a readiness of humor which delighted the king.
NA
NA
NA
â€œIn quite a different light from that in which I saw it half an hour
NA
NA
â€œOh! a very simple thing, sire; half an hour ago I returned from
Bois-Rochin, where I had nothing to light me but a stupid stable

NA
â€œWhile now I have all the wax-lights of your cabinet, and more than
that, your majestyâ€™s own eyes, which illuminate everything, like the

The king began to laugh; and Saint-Aignan broke out into convulsions of
merriment.

conversation where the king had left off; â€œhe has been imagining all
along, that not only was M. de Guiche wounded by a bullet, but still

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œM. de Guicheâ€™s wound--a mere dream; the bullet, a dream. So, take my

speak of your dream to any one, Monsieur Valot, and, upon the word of
a gentleman, you will have no occasion to repent it. Good evening,

Saint-Aignan looked at the king.

Chapter XX. Showing the Advantage of Having Two Strings to Oneâ€™s Bow.
Manicamp quitted the kingâ€™s apartment, delighted at having succeeded
so well, when, just as he reached the bottom of the staircase and was
passing a doorway, he felt that some one suddenly pulled him by the
sleeve. He turned round and recognized Montalais, who was waiting for
him in the passage, and who, in a very mysterious manner, with her
body bent forward, and in a low tone of voice, said to him, â€œFollow me,
NA
NA
â€œIn the first place, a true knight would not have asked such a question,
NA
â€œWell, mademoiselle, I am quite ready to conduct myself as a true
NA
â€œNo; it is too late, and you cannot take the credit of it. We are going
NA
NA
And he followed Montalais, who ran before him as light as Galatea.
NA
that stories about hunting expeditions would be acceptable. We will try,
however, and if need be--well, if there should be any occasion for it,
NA
Montalais still ran on.
NA
NA
At last, however, they arrived. Madame had just finished undressing, and
was in a most elegant _deshabille_, but it must be understood that she
had changed her dress before she had any idea of being subjected to
the emotions now agitating her. She was waiting with the most restless
impatience; and Montalais and Manicamp found her standing near the door.
At the sound of their approaching footsteps, Madame came forward to meet
them.
NA
NA
Manicamp bowed with the greatest respect; Madame signed to Montalais to
withdraw, and she immediately obeyed. Madame followed her with her eyes,
in silence, until the door closed behind her, and then, turning towards
Manicamp, said, â€œWhat is the matter?--and is it true, as I am told,
NA
NA
NA
heard it rumored, but not confirmed. And so, in truth, it is Monsieur de
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œOh, you will not insult me by supposing that I credit the absurd fable,
with what object I cannot tell, respecting M. de Guiche having been
wounded by a wild boar. No, no, monsieur; the real truth is known, and,
in addition to the inconvenience of his wound, M. de Guiche runs the

NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI told him how M. de Guiche went to the chase, and how a wild boar
rushed forth out of the Bois-Rochin; how M. de Guiche fired at it, and
how, in fact, the furious brute dashed at De Guiche, killed his horse,
NA
NA
NA
NA
And Madame walked up and down the room, casting a searching look from
time to time at Manicamp, who remained motionless and impassible in the
same place. At last she stopped.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou ask such a question! You, M. de Guicheâ€™s intimate friend, his
NA
â€œOh, Madame! his intimate friend--yes; confidant--no. De Guiche is a man
who can keep his own secrets, who has some of his own certainly, but who
never breathes a syllable about them. De Guiche is discretion itself,
NA
â€œVery well, then; those secrets which M. de Guiche keeps so

princess, almost spitefully; â€œfor the king may possibly question you a
second time, and if, on the second occasion, you were to repeat the same

â€œBut, Madame, I think your highness is mistaken with regard to the king.
NA
â€œIn that case, permit me to assure you, Monsieur de Manicamp, it only

â€œI think your highness is mistaken in arriving at such an opinion; his

â€œAnd do you suppose that he will thank you for your officious falsehood,
when he will learn to-morrow that M. de Guiche had, on behalf of his
NA
NA
innocent expression in the world; â€œwhat does your royal highness do me
NA
â€œWhat is there astonishing in that? M. de Guiche is susceptible,
NA
â€œOn the contrary, Madame, I know M. de Guiche to be very patient, and
NA
NA
NA
â€œVery good; you will not deny, I suppose, that M. de Bragelonne is M. de

NA
â€œWell, then, M. de Guiche has taken M. de Bragelonneâ€™s part; and as M.

Manicamp began to smile, and moved his head and shoulders very slightly,
NA

NA
â€œOf course; it is quite clear you are not of my opinion, and that you

NA
â€œWhat!--you do not understand a single word about M. de Guicheâ€™s quarrel

Manicamp remained silent.
NA
scandalous in its tone and purport, and more or less well founded,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œIt would seem, monsieur, that, if I happened to be a man, you would
challenge me, notwithstanding his majestyâ€™s edicts, as Monsieur de
Guiche challenged M. de Wardes; and that, too, on account of the virtue
NA
NA
backwards, as if that was the very last name he expected to hear
pronounced.
NA
Madame, ironically; â€œdo you mean to say you would be impertinent enough
NA
â€œMadame, in the whole course of this affair there has not been the
NA
â€œWhat! when two men have almost blown each otherâ€™s brains out on a
womanâ€™s behalf, do you mean to say she has had nothing to do with the
affair, and that her name has not been called in question at all? I did

NA
NA
â€œForgive me, then; but I fancied I understood your highness to remark
that De Guiche and De Wardes had fought on Mademoiselle de la Valliereâ€™s

NA
NA
Manicamp.
â€œI do not say that M. de Guiche personally took an interest in
Mademoiselle de la Valliere, but I say that he did so as representing or
NA
NA
â€œCome, do not always assume such a bewildered look. Does not every
one here know that M. de Bragelonne is affianced to Mademoiselle de la
Valliere, and that before he went on the mission with which the king
intrusted him, he charged his friend M. de Guiche to watch over that

â€œThere is nothing more for me to say, then. Your highness is

Manicamp began to laugh, which almost exasperated the princess, who was
not, as we know, of a very patient disposition.
NA
bury this affair altogether in forgetfulness, for it will probably never
NA
â€œOh, as far as that goes there is nothing more to do, and the
information is complete. The king will learn that M. de Guiche has taken
up the cause of this little adventuress, who gives herself all the
airs of a grand lady; he will learn that Monsieur de Bragelonne, having
nominated his friend M. de Guiche his guardian-in-ordinary, the latter
immediately fastened, as he was required to do, upon the Marquis de
Wardes, who ventured to trench upon his privileges. Moreover, you
cannot pretend to deny, Monsieur Manicamp--you who know everything so
well--that the king on his side casts a longing eye upon this famous
treasure, and that he will bear no slight grudge against M. de Guiche
for constituting himself its defender. Are you sufficiently well
informed now, or do you require anything further? If so, speak,
NA
NA
â€œLearn, however--for you ought to know it, Monsieur de Manicamp--learn
that his majestyâ€™s indignation will be followed by terrible
consequences. In princes of a similar temperament to that of his
majesty, the passion which jealousy causes sweeps down like a

NA
â€œI mean, Madame, that, with respect to the defense which Monsieur de
Guiche undertook in M. de Bragelonneâ€™s absence, I am surprised that your
highness has not detected a pretext in La Valliereâ€™s name having been

the truth to her.

insinuations which were reported respecting the dukeâ€™s exile? Must I
remind you of the anxious care the comte always took in his efforts to
please, to watch, to protect that person for whom alone he lives,--for
whom alone he breathes? Well! I will do so; and when I shall have made
you recall all the particulars I refer to, you will perhaps understand
how it happened that the comte, having lost all control over himself,
and having been for some time past almost harassed to death by De
Wardes, became, at the first disrespectful expression which the latter
pronounced respecting the person in question, inflamed with passion, and

exclamations of the princess, â€œnothing will astonish you any

instance of tact and perfect coolness, and if the person in whose
behalf the comte so fought and shed his blood does, in reality, owe
some gratitude to the poor wounded sufferer, it is not on account of the
blood he has shed, or the agony he has suffered, but for the steps he
has taken to preserve from comment or reflection an honor which is more

Manicamp felt he could now breathe for a moment--and gallantly had he
won the right to do so. Madame, on her side, remained for some time
plunged in a painful reverie. Her agitation could be seen by her quick
respiration, by her drooping eyelids, by the frequency with which she
pressed her hand upon her heart. But, in her, coquetry was not so much
a passive quality, as, on the contrary, a fire which sought for fuel to
maintain itself, finding anywhere and everywhere what it required.

Manicamp perceived that there still remained some lingering doubt in the

service to M. de Bragelonne! The duel has created a sensation which, in
some respects, casts a dishonorable suspicion upon that young girl;
a sensation, indeed, which will embroil her with the vicomte. The
consequence is that De Wardesâ€™s pistol-bullet has had three results
instead of one; it destroys at the same time the honor of a woman, the
happiness of a man, and, perhaps, it has wounded to death one of
the best gentlemen in France. Oh, Madame! your logic is cold--even

Manicampâ€™s concluding words scattered to the winds the last doubt which
lingered, not in Madameâ€™s heart, but in her mind. She was no longer
a princess full of scruples, nor a woman with her ever-returning
suspicions, but one whose heart has just felt the mortal chill of a

Manicamp seemed overcome by a violent emotion. He had, in fact,
displayed no little energy in the latter part of his speech. As for
Madame, she entirely threw aside all regard for the formal observances
of propriety society imposes; for when, with her, passion spoke
in accents either of anger or sympathy, nothing could restrain her
impulses. Madame approached Manicamp, who had subsided in a chair, as if

Manicamp turned round, bowed once more, and left the room, his heart
overflowing with joy. In fact, he knew very well that the presence of
Madame herself would be the best balm to apply to his friendâ€™s wounds. A
quarter of an hour had hardly elapsed when he heard the sound of a door
opened softly, and closed with like precaution. He listened to the light
footfalls gliding down the staircase, and then heard the signal agreed
upon. He immediately went out, and, faithful to his promise, bent
his way, without once turning his head, through the streets of
Fontainebleau, towards the doctorâ€™s dwelling.
Chapter XXI. M. Malicorne the Keeper of the Records of France.
Two women, their figures completely concealed by their mantles, and
whose masks effectually hid the upper portion of their faces, timidly
followed Manicampâ€™s steps. On the first floor, behind curtains of
red damask, the soft light of a lamp placed upon a low table faintly
illumined the room, at the other extremity of which, on a large bedstead
supported by spiral columns, around which curtains of the same color as
those which deadened the rays of the lamp had been closely drawn, lay De
Guiche, his head supported by pillows, his eyes looking as if the mists
of death were gathering; his long black hair, scattered over the pillow,
set off the young manâ€™s hollow temples. It was easy to see that fever
was the chief tenant of the chamber. De Guiche was dreaming. His
wandering mind was pursuing, through gloom and mystery, one of those
wild creations delirium engenders. Two or three drops of blood, still
liquid, stained the floor. Manicamp hurriedly ran up the stairs, but
paused at the threshold of the door, looked into the room, and seeing
that everything was perfectly quiet, he advanced towards the foot of the
large leathern armchair, a specimen of furniture of the reign of Henry
IV., and seeing that the nurse, as a matter of course, had dropped off
to sleep, he awoke her, and begged her to pass into the adjoining room.
Then, standing by the side of the bed, he remained for a moment
deliberating whether it would be better to awaken Guiche, in order to
acquaint him with the good news. But, as he began to hear behind the
door the rustling of silk dresses and the hurried breathing of his two
companions, and as he already saw that the curtain screening the doorway
seemed on the point of being impatiently drawn aside, he passed round
the bed and followed the nurse into the next room. As soon as he had
disappeared the curtain was raised, and his two female companions
entered the room he had just left. The one who entered first made a
gesture to her companion, which riveted her to the spot where she stood,
close to the door, and then resolutely advanced towards the bed, drew
back the curtains along the iron rod, and threw them in thick folds
behind the head of the bed. She gazed upon the comteâ€™s pallid face;
remarked his right hand enveloped in linen whose dazzling whiteness was
emphasized by the counterpane patterned with dark leaves thrown across
the couch. She shuddered as she saw a stain of blood growing larger
and larger upon the bandages. The young manâ€™s breast was uncovered,
as though for the cool night air to assist his respiration. A narrow
bandage fastened the dressings of the wound, around which a purplish
circle of extravasated blood was gradually increasing in size. A deep
sigh broke from her lips. She leaned against one of the columns of the
bed, and gazed, through the apertures in her mask, upon the harrowing
spectacle before her. A hoarse harsh groan passed like a death-rattle
through the comteâ€™s clenched teeth. The masked lady seized his left
hand, which scorched like burning coals. But at the very moment she
placed her icy hand upon it, the action of the cold was such that De
Guiche opened his eyes, and by a look in which revived intelligence
was dawning, seemed as though struggling back again into existence. The
first thing upon which he fixed his gaze was this phantom standing erect
by his bedside. At that sight, his eyes became dilated, but without any
appearance of consciousness in them. The lady thereupon made a sign to
her companion, who had remained at the door; and in all probability the
latter had already received her lesson, for in a clear tone of
voice, and without any hesitation whatever, she pronounced these
words:--â€œMonsieur le comte, her royal highness Madame is desirous of
knowing how you are able to bear your wound, and to express to you, by
NA
As she pronounced the word Madame, Guiche started; he had not as yet
remarked the person to whom the voice belonged, and he naturally turned
towards the direction whence it preceded. But, as he felt the cold hand
still resting on his own, he again turned towards the motionless figure

thread, the masked lady could not restrain her tears, which flowed under
the mask, and appeared upon her cheeks just where the mask left her face
bare. If De Guiche had been in fuller possession of his senses, he would
have seen her tears roll like glistening pearls, and fall upon his bed.
The lady, forgetting that she wore her mask, raised her hand as though
to wipe her eyes, and meeting the rough velvet, she tore away her mask
in anger, and threw it on the floor. At the unexpected apparition before
him, which seemed to issue from a cloud, De Guiche uttered a cry and
stretched his arms towards her; but every word perished on his lips, and
his strength seemed utterly abandoning him. His right hand, which had
followed his first impulse, without calculating the amount of strength
he had left, fell back again upon the bed, and immediately afterwards
the white linen was stained with a larger spot than before. In the
meantime, the young manâ€™s eyes became dim, and closed, as if he were
already struggling with the messenger of death; and then, after a few
involuntary movements, his head fell back motionless on his pillow; his
face grew livid. The lady was frightened; but on this occasion, contrary
to what is usually the case, fear attracted. She leaned over the young
man, gazed earnestly, fixedly at his pale, cold face, which she almost
touched, then imprinted a rapid kiss upon De Guicheâ€™s left hand, who,
trembling as if an electric shock had passed through him, awoke a second
time, opened his large eyes, incapable of recognition, and again

NA
towards the staircase, and as the outer door had been left only
half-closed, the two women, light as birds, passed through it, and
with hurried steps returned to the palace. One of them ascended towards
Madameâ€™s apartments, where she disappeared; the other entered the rooms
belonging to the maids of honor, namely, on the _entresol_, and having
reached her own room, she sat down before a table, and without giving
herself time even to breathe, wrote the following letter:
â€œThis evening Madame has been to see M. de Guiche. Everything is going
well on this side. See that your news is equally exemplary, and do not

She folded the letter, and leaving her room with every possible
precaution, crossed a corridor which led to the apartments appropriated
to the gentlemen attached to Monsieurâ€™s service. She stopped before a
door, under which, having previously knocked twice in a short, quick
manner, she thrust the paper, and fled. Then, returning to her own
room, she removed every trace of her having gone out, and also of
having written the letter. Amid the investigations she was so diligently
pursuing she perceived on the table the mask which belonged to Madame,
and which, according to her mistressâ€™s directions, she had brought back

NA
And she took hold of the velvet mask by that part which covered the
cheeks, and feeling that her thumb was wet, looked at it. It was not
only wet, but reddened. The mask had fallen upon one of the spots of
blood which, we have already said, stained the floor, and from that
black velvet outside which had accidentally come into contact with
it, the blood had passed through to the inside, and stained the white

Then, after a momentâ€™s silence, and with a smile that was peculiarly her

Chapter XXII. The Journey.
The next day being agreed upon for the departure, the king, at eleven
oâ€™clock precisely, descended the grand staircase with the two queens and
Madame, in order to enter his carriage drawn by six horses, that were
pawing the ground in impatience at the foot of the staircase. The whole
court awaited the royal appearance in the _Fer-a-cheval_ crescent,
in their travelling costumes; the large number of saddled horses and
carriages of ladies and gentlemen of the court, surrounded by their
attendants, servants, and pages, formed a spectacle whose brilliancy
could scarcely be equalled. The king entered his carriage with the two
queens; Madame was in the same one with Monsieur. The maids of honor
followed their example, and took their seats, two by two, in the
carriages destined for them. The weather was exceedingly warm; a light
breeze, which, early in the morning, all had thought would have proved
sufficient to cool the air, soon became fiercely heated by the rays of
the sun, although it was hidden behind the clouds, and filtered through
the heated vapor which rose from the ground like a scorching wind,
bearing particles of fine dust against the faces of the travelers.
Madame was the first to complain of the heat. Monsieurâ€™s only reply was
to throw himself back in the carriage as though about to faint, and to
inundate himself with scents and perfumes, uttering the deepest sighs
all the while; whereupon Madame said to him, with her most amiable
expression:--â€œReally, Monsieur, I fancied that you would have been
polite enough, on account of the terrible heat, to have left me my
carriage to myself, and to have performed the journey yourself on

NA
showed how little idea he had of adopting this unnatural advice; â€œyou
cannot suppose such a thing, Madame! My skin would peel off if I were to

Madame began to laugh.
NA
NA
NA
NA
solitude she required, at least obtained the amusement of teasing.
â€œNo horse! You are mistaken, Monsieur; for I see your favorite bay out
NA
NA
out of the door; but the movement he was obliged to make cost him so
much trouble that he soon hastened to resume his immobility.
NA
NA
And with these words he closed his eyes, like a man on the point of
death. Madame, on her side, reclined indolently in the other corner of
the carriage, and closed her eyes also, not, however, to sleep, but to
think more at her ease. In the meantime the king, seated in the front
seat of his carriage, the back of which he had yielded up to the two
queens, was a prey to that feverish contrariety experienced by anxious
lovers, who, without being able to quench their ardent thirst, are
ceaselessly desirous of seeing the loved object, and then go away
partially satisfied, without perceiving they have acquired a more
insatiable thirst than ever. The king, whose carriage headed the
procession, could not from the place he occupied perceive the carriages
of the ladies and maids of honor, which followed in a line behind it.
Besides, he was obliged to answer the eternal questions of the young
NA
him in utter forgetfulness of royal etiquette, invested him with all her
affection, stifled him with her attentions, afraid that some one might
come to take him from her, or that he himself might suddenly take a
fancy to quit her society. Anne of Austria, whom nothing at that moment
occupied except the occasional cruel throbbings in her bosom, looked
pleased and delighted, and although she perfectly realized the kingâ€™s
impatience, tantalizingly prolonged his sufferings by unexpectedly
resuming the conversation at the very moment the king, absorbed in his
own reflections, began to muse over his secret attachment. Everything
seemed to combine--not alone the little teasing attentions of the queen,
but also the queen-motherâ€™s interruptions--to make the kingâ€™s position
almost insupportable; for he knew not how to control the restless
longings of his heart. At first, he complained of the heat--a complaint
merely preliminary to others, but with sufficient tact to prevent
Maria Theresa guessing his real object. Understanding the kingâ€™s remark
literally, she began to fan him with her ostrich plumes. But the heat
passed away, and the king then complained of cramps and stiffness in his
legs, and as the carriages at that moment stopped to change horses, the
queen said:--â€œShall I get out with you? I too feel tired of sitting. We
can walk on a little distance; the carriage will overtake us, and we can
NA
The king frowned; it is a hard trial a jealous woman makes her husband
submit to whose fidelity she suspects, when, although herself a prey
to jealousy, she watches herself so narrowly that she avoids giving any
pretext for an angry feeling. The king, therefore, in the present case,
could not refuse; he accepted the offer, alighted from the carriage,
gave his arm to the queen, and walked up and down with her while the
horses were being changed. As he walked along, he cast an envious glance
upon the courtiers, who were fortunate enough to be on horseback. The
queen soon found out that the promenade she had suggested afforded
the king as little pleasure as he had experienced from driving. She
accordingly expressed a wish to return to her carriage, and the king
conducted her to the door, but did not get in with her. He stepped back
a few paces, and looked along the file of carriages for the purpose of
recognizing the one in which he took so strong an interest. At the door
of the sixth carriage he saw La Valliereâ€™s fair countenance. As the
king thus stood motionless, wrapt in thought, without perceiving that
everything was ready, and that he alone was causing the delay, he heard
a voice close beside him, addressing him in the most respectful manner.
It was M. Malicorne, in a complete costume of an equerry, holding over
his left arm the bridles of a couple of horses.
NA
NA
to remember the person who addressed him, and whose face was not as yet
familiar to him.
NA
NA
And Malicorne pointed at Monsieurâ€™s bay horse, which Madame had
observed. It was a beautiful creature royally caparisoned.
NA
â€œSire, it is a horse out of his royal highnessâ€™s stables; but he does
NA
Louis did not reply, but approached the horse, which stood pawing the
ground with its foot. Malicorne hastened to hold the stirrup for him,
but the king was already in the saddle. Restored to good-humor by this
lucky accident, the king hastened towards the queenâ€™s carriage, where he
was anxiously expected; and notwithstanding Maria Theresaâ€™s thoughtful
and preoccupied air, he said: â€œI have been fortunate enough to find
this horse, and I intend to avail myself of it. I felt stifled in the
NA
Then bending gracefully over the arched neck of his beautiful steed,
he disappeared in a second. Anne of Austria leaned forward, in order
to look after him as he rode away; he did not get very far, for when he
reached the sixth carriage, he reined in his horse suddenly and took off
his hat. He saluted La Valliere, who uttered a cry of surprise as
she saw him, blushing at the same time with pleasure. Montalais, who
occupied the other seat in the carriage, made the king a most respectful
bow. And then, with all the tact of a woman, she pretended to be
exceedingly interested in the landscape, and withdrew herself into the
left-hand corner. The conversation between the king and La Valliere
began, as all loversâ€™ conversations generally do, namely, by eloquent
looks and by a few words utterly devoid of common sense. The king
explained how warm he had felt in his carriage, so much so indeed that
he could almost regard the horse he then rode as a blessing thrown in
NA
man, for he seemed to guess my thoughts intuitively. I have now only
one wish, that of learning the name of the gentleman who so cleverly
assisted his king out of his dilemma, and extricated him from his cruel
NA
Montalais, during this colloquy, the first words of which had awakened
her attention, had slightly altered her position, and contrived so as
to meet the kingâ€™s look as he finished his remark. It followed very
naturally that the king looked inquiringly as much at her as at La
Valliere; she had every reason to suppose that it was herself who
was appealed to, and consequently might be permitted to answer. She
therefore said: â€œSire, the horse which your majesty is riding belongs to

NA
The name produced its usual effect, for the king repeated it smilingly.
NA
NA
sanctified expression, was galloping by the side of the carriage,
knowing perfectly well that they were talking of him at that very
moment, but sitting in his saddle as if he were deaf and dumb.
NA
NA
Aure had now nothing further to do; she had let Malicorneâ€™s name fall;
the soil was good; all that was now left to be done was to let the
name take root, and the event would bear fruit in due season. She
consequently threw herself back in her corner, feeling perfectly
justified in making as many agreeable signs of recognition as she liked
to Malicorne, since the latter had had the happiness of pleasing the
king. As will readily be believed, Montalais was not mistaken; and
Malicorne, with his quick ear and his sly look, seemed to interpret
NA
pantomimic action, which he fancied conveyed something resembling a
kiss.

NA
La Valliere still remained silent, but raised her eyes, brimful of
affection, toward the king. Louis, as if overcome by this burning
glance, passed his hand across his forehead, and pressing the sides
of his horse with his knees, made him bound several paces forward. La
Valliere, leaning back in her carriage, with her eyes half closed, gazed
fixedly upon the king, whose plumes were floating in the air; she could
not but admire his graceful carriage, his delicate and nervous limbs
which pressed his horseâ€™s sides, and the regular outline of his
features, which his beautiful curling hair set off to great advantage,
revealing occasionally his small and well-formed ear. In fact the poor
girl was in love, and she reveled in her innocent affection. In a few
moments the king was again by her side.
NA
Oh! mademoiselle, how pitilessly inexorable you would become if you were
ever to resolve to break off all acquaintance with any one; and then,
too, I think you changeable; in fact--in fact, I dread this deep

She hid her face in her hands.
NA
NA
â€œOh, no! sire, be perfectly satisfied as to that. No, I say again; no,

â€œThat you will never show any of that severity which would break my
heart, none of that fickleness of manner which would be worse than death

NA
â€œVery well, then! but listen. I like promises, I like to place under
the guarantee of an oath, under the protection of Heaven, in fact,
everything which interests my heart and my affections. Promise me, or
rather swear to me, that if in the life we are about to commence, a life
which will be full of sacrifice, mystery, anxiety, disappointment, and
misunderstanding; swear to me that if we should in any way deceive, or
misunderstand each other, or should judge each other unjustly, for that

She trembled with agitation to the very depths of her heart; it was the
first time she had heard her name pronounced in that manner by her
royal lover. As for the king, taking off his glove, and placing his
hand within the carriage, he continued:--â€œSwear, that never in all
our quarrels will we allow one night even to pass by, if any
misunderstanding should arise between us, without a visit, or at least
a message, from either, in order to convey consolation and repose to the

La Valliere took her loverâ€™s burning hand between her own cool palms,
and pressed it softly, until a movement of the horse, frightened by the
proximity of the wheels, obliged her to abandon her happiness. She had
vowed as he desired.
NA
NA
Louis obeyed, saluted Mademoiselle de Montalais, and set off at a gallop
to rejoin the queen. As he passed Monsieurâ€™s carriage, he observed that
he was fast asleep, although Madame, on her part, was wide awake. As
the king passed her she said, â€œWhat a beautiful horse, sire! Is it not

dissolution of a loverâ€™s affection; and then, by dint of loving, the

Chapter XXIV. The First Quarrel.
La Valliere entered the queen-motherâ€™s apartments without in the least
suspecting that a serious plot was being concerted against her. She
thought it was for something connected with her duties, and never had
the queen-mother been unkind to her when such was the case. Besides, not
being immediately under the control or direction of Anne of Austria,
she could only have an official connection with her, to which her own
gentleness of disposition, and the rank of the august princess, made
her yield on every occasion with the best possible grace. She therefore
advanced towards the queen-mother with that soft and gentle smile
which constituted her principal charm, and as she did not approach
sufficiently close, Anne of Austria signed to her to come nearer. Madame
then entered the room, and with a perfectly calm air took her seat
beside her mother-in-law, and continued the work which Maria Theresa had
begun. When La Valliere, instead of the direction which she expected to
receive immediately on entering the room, perceived these preparations,
she looked with curiosity, if not with uneasiness, at the two
princesses. Anne seemed full of thought, while Madame maintained an
affectation of indifference that would have alarmed a less timid person
even than Louise.

La Valliere sank at the queenâ€™s feet, who turned her back upon her.
She stretched out her hands towards Madame, who laughed in her face. A
feeling of pride made her rise to her feet.

La Valliere, instead of giving way, as from her extreme pallor and her

and dignified air; she bowed profoundly, and left the room.

A proud, defiant look of the queen-mother was the reply to this
objection, which was by no means deficient in finesse; and both of them,
almost sure of their victory, went to look for Maria Theresa, who had
been waiting for them with impatience.
It was about half-past six in the evening, and the king had just
partaken of refreshment. He lost no time; but the repast finished, and
business matters settled, he took Saint-Aignan by the arm, and desired
him to lead the way to La Valliereâ€™s apartments. The courtier uttered an
exclamation.
â€œWell, what is that for? It is a habit you will have to adopt, and in
NA
NA
be seen entering or leaving those apartments. If, however, some pretext
or other were made use of--if your majesty, for instance, would wait

like. To-morrow we will devise all sorts of means; to-night I have no
NA
Saint-Aignan made no reply; he descended the steps, preceding the king,
and crossed the different courtyards with a feeling of shame, which the
distinguished honor of accompanying the king did not remove. The reason
was that Saint-Aignan wished to stand well with Madame, as well as
with the queens, and also, that he did not, on the other hand, want to
displease Mademoiselle de la Valliere: and in order to carry out so
many promising affairs, it was difficult to avoid jostling against some
obstacle or other. Besides, the windows of the young queenâ€™s rooms,
those of the queen-motherâ€™s, and of Madame herself, looked out upon the
courtyard of the maids of honor. To be seen, therefore, accompanying the
king, would be effectually to quarrel with three great and influential
princesses--whose authority was unbounded--for the purpose of supporting
the ephemeral credit of a mistress. The unhappy Saint-Aignan, who had
not displayed a very great amount of courage in taking La Valliereâ€™s
part in the park of Fontainebleau, did not feel any braver in the broad
day-light, and found a thousand defects in the poor girl which he was
most eager to communicate to the king. But his trial soon finished,--the
courtyards were crossed; not a curtain was drawn aside, nor a window
opened. The king walked hastily, because of his impatience, and the
long legs of Saint-Aignan, who preceded him. At the door, however,
Saint-Aignan wished to retire, but the king desired him to remain; a
delicate consideration, on the kingâ€™s part, which the courtier could
very well have dispensed with. He had to follow Louis into La Valliereâ€™s
apartment. As soon as the king arrived the young girl dried her tears,
but so precipitately that the king perceived it. He questioned her most
anxiously and tenderly, and pressed her to tell him the cause of her
emotion.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Saint-Aignan ought to have answered, but he was too much embarrassed.
NA
NA
â€œNo, no; you no longer possess the air of supreme contentment which
renders you so beautiful and so attractive. You do not look at me. Why

NA
â€œIn that case, pray resume your gentle air of gayety, or that sweet
melancholy look which I so loved in you this morning; for pityâ€™s sake,
NA
NA
The king tapped the floor impatiently with his foot, saying, â€œSuch a
NA
had also remarked La Valliereâ€™s peculiar lethargy, as well as the kingâ€™s
impatience.
It was futile for the king to entreat, and as useless for him to try to
overcome her depression: the poor girl was completely overwhelmed,--the
appearance of an angel would hardly have awakened her from her torpor.
The king saw in her repeated negative replies a mystery full of
unkindness; he began to look round the apartment with a suspicious air.
There happened to be in La Valliereâ€™s room a miniature of Athos.
The king remarked that this portrait bore a strong resemblance to
Bragelonne, for it had been taken when the count was quite a young man.
He looked at it with a threatening air. La Valliere, in her misery far
indeed from thinking of this portrait, could not conjecture the cause
of the kingâ€™s preoccupation. And yet the kingâ€™s mind was occupied with
a terrible remembrance, which had more than once taken possession of
his mind, but which he had always driven away. He recalled the
intimacy existing between the two young people from their birth, their
engagement, and that Athos himself had come to solicit La Valliereâ€™s
hand for Raoul. He therefore could not but suppose that on her return
to Paris, La Valliere had found news from London awaiting her, and that
this news had counterbalanced the influence he had been enabled to exert
over her. He immediately felt himself stung, as it were, by feelings
of the wildest jealousy; and again questioned her, with increased
bitterness. La Valliere could not reply, unless she were to acknowledge
everything, which would be to accuse the queen, and Madame also; and the
consequence would be, that she would have to enter into an open warfare
with these two great and powerful princesses. She thought within herself
that as she made no attempt to conceal from the king what was passing in
her own mind, the king ought to be able to read in her heart, in
spite of her silence; and that, had he really loved her, he would have
understood and guessed everything. What was sympathy, then, if not that
divine flame which possesses the property of enlightening the heart, and
of saving lovers the necessity of an expression of their thoughts and
feelings? She maintained her silence, therefore, sighing, and concealing
her face in her hands. These sighs and tears, which had at first
distressed, then terrified Louis XIV., now irritated him. He could not
bear opposition,--the opposition which tears and sighs exhibited, any
more than opposition of any other kind. His remarks, therefore, became
bitter, urgent, and openly aggressive in their nature. This was a
fresh cause of distress for the poor girl. From that very circumstance,
therefore, which she regarded as an injustice on her loverâ€™s part, she
drew sufficient courage to bear, not only her other troubles, but this
one also.
The king next began to accuse her in direct terms. La Valliere did not
even attempt to defend herself; she endured all his accusations without
according any other reply than that of shaking her head; without any
other remark than that which escapes the heart in deep distress--a
prayerful appeal to Heaven for help. But this ejaculation, instead of
calming the kingâ€™s displeasure, rather increased it. He, moreover, saw
himself seconded by Saint-Aignan, for Saint-Aignan, as we have observed,
having seen the storm increasing, and not knowing the extent of the
regard of which Louis XIV. was capable, felt, by anticipation, all the
collected wrath of the three princesses, and the near approach of poor
La Valliereâ€™s downfall, and he was not true knight enough to resist
the fear that he himself might be dragged down in the impending ruin.
Saint-Aignan did not reply to the kingâ€™s questions except by short, dry
remarks, pronounced half-aloud; and by abrupt gestures, whose object was
to make things worse, and bring about a misunderstanding, the result
of which would be to free him from the annoyance of having to cross the
courtyards in open day, in order to follow his illustrious companion to
La Valliereâ€™s apartments. In the meantime the kingâ€™s anger momentarily
increased; he made two or three steps towards the door as if to leave
the room, but returned. The young girl did not, however, raise her head,
although the sound of his footsteps might have warned her that her lover
was leaving her. He drew himself up, for a moment, before her, with his
arms crossed.

â€œIs it so difficult, then, to speak the truth? You could have told me

La Valliere was just on the point of revealing the truth to the king,
her arms made a sudden movement as if they were about to open, but her
lips remained silent, and her hands again fell listlessly by her side.
The poor girl had not yet endured sufficient unhappiness to risk the

And this time nothing could restrain him. The impulse of his heart was
not sufficient to induce him to turn back, and he darted out of the room
with a gesture full of despair. Saint-Aignan followed him, wishing for
nothing better than to quit the place.
Louis XIV. did not pause until he reached the staircase, and grasping

to follow the king, and timidly glancing up at the different windows.
Unfortunately their return was not, like their arrival, unobserved. A
curtain was suddenly drawn aside; Madame was behind it. She had seen
the king leave the apartments of the maids of honor, and as soon as she
observed that his majesty had passed, she left her own apartments with
hurried steps, and ran up the staircase that led to the room the king
had just left.
Chapter XXV. Despair.
As soon as the king was gone La Valliere raised herself from the ground,
and stretched out her arms, as if to follow and detain him, but when,
having violently closed the door, the sound of his retreating footsteps
could be heard in the distance, she had hardly sufficient strength
left to totter towards and fall at the foot of her crucifix. There
she remained, broken-hearted, absorbed, and overwhelmed by her grief,
forgetful and indifferent to everything but her profound sorrow;--a
grief she only vaguely realized--as though by instinct. In the midst of
this wild tumult of thoughts, La Valliere heard her door open again; she
started, and turned round, thinking it was the king who had returned.
She was deceived, however, for it was Madame who appeared at the
door. What did she now care for Madame! Again she sank down, her head
supported by her _prie-Dieu_ chair. It was Madame, agitated, angry,
NA
princess, standing before La Valliere, â€œthis is very fine, I admit,
to kneel and pray, and make a pretense of being religious; but however
submissive you may be in your address to Heaven, it is desirable that
you should pay some little attention to the wishes of those who reign

La Valliere raised her head painfully in token of respect.
NA

La Valliereâ€™s fixed and wild gaze showed how complete her forgetfulness
or ignorance was.

such a manner that no one could be justified in spreading any reports

La Valliere darted an inquiring look towards her.

you would be the cause of such an example. I beg you to understand,
therefore, in the absence of any witness of your shame--for I do not
wish to humiliate you--that you are from this moment at perfect liberty
NA
La Valliere could not sink lower, nor could she suffer more than she had
already suffered. Her countenance did not even change, but she remained
kneeling with her hands clasped, like the figure of the Magdalen.
NA
A shiver, which passed through her whole frame, was La Valliereâ€™s only
reply. And as the victim gave no other signs of life, Madame left the
room. And then, her very respiration suspended, and her blood almost
congealed, as it were, in her veins, La Valliere by degrees felt that
the pulsation of her wrists, her neck, and temples, began to throb more
and more painfully. These pulsations, as they gradually increased, soon
changed into a species of brain fever, and in her temporary delirium
she saw the figures of her friends contending with her enemies, floating
before her vision. She heard, too, mingled together in her deafened
ears, words of menace and words of fond affection; she seemed raised out
of her existence as though it were upon the wings of a mighty tempest,
and in the dim horizon of the path along which her delirium hurried
her, she saw the stone which covered her tomb upraised, and the grim,
appalling texture of eternal night revealed to her distracted gaze. But
the horror of the dream which possessed her senses faded away, and she
was again restored to the habitual resignation of her character. A ray
of hope penetrated her heart, as a ray of sunlight streams into the
dungeon of some unhappy captive. Her mind reverted to the journey from
Fontainebleau, she saw the king riding beside her carriage, telling
her that he loved her, asking for her love in return, requiring her to
swear, and himself to swear too, that never should an evening pass by,
if ever a misunderstanding were to arise between them, without a visit,
a letter, a sign of some kind, being sent, to replace the troubled
anxiety of the evening with the calm repose of the night. It was the
king who had suggested that, who had imposed a promise on her, and who
had sworn to it himself. It was impossible, therefore, she reasoned,
that the king should fail in keeping the promise which he had himself
exacted from her, unless, indeed, Louis was a despot who enforced love
as he enforced obedience; unless, too, the king were so indifferent
that the first obstacle in his way was sufficient to arrest his further
progress. The king, that kind protector, who by a word, a single
word, could relieve her distress of mind, the king even joined her
persecutors. Oh! his anger could not possibly last. Now that he was
alone, he would be suffering all that she herself was a prey to. But he
was not tied hand and foot as she was; he could act, could move about,
could come to her, while she could do nothing but wait. And the poor
girl waited and waited, with breathless anxiety--for she could not
believe it possible that the king would not come.
It was now about half-past ten. He would either come to her, or write to
her, or send some kind word by M. de Saint-Aignan. If he were to come,
oh! how she would fly to meet him; how she would thrust aside that
excess of delicacy which she now discovered was misunderstood; how
eagerly she would explain: â€œIt is not I who do not love you--it is the
NA
confessed that she reflected upon it, and also the more she reflected,
Louis appeared to her to be less guilty. In fact, he was ignorant of
everything. What must he have thought of the obstinacy with which she
remained silent? Impatient and irritable as the king was known to be, it
was extraordinary that he had been able to preserve his temper so long.
And yet, had it been her own case, she undoubtedly would not have acted
in such a manner; she would have understood--have guessed everything.
Yes, but she was nothing but a poor simple-minded girl, and not a
great and powerful monarch. Oh! if he would but come, if he would but
come!--how eagerly she would forgive him for all he had just made her
suffer! how much more tenderly she would love him because she had so
cruelly suffered! And so she sat, with her head bent forward in eager
expectation towards the door, her lips slightly parted, as if--and
Heaven forgive her for the mental exclamation!--they were awaiting the
kiss which the kingâ€™s lips had in the morning so sweetly indicated, when
he pronounced the word _love!_ If the king did not come, at least he
would write; it was a second chance; a chance less delightful certainly
than the other, but which would show an affection just as strong, only
more timid in its nature. Oh! how she would devour his letter, how eager
she would be to answer it! and when the messenger who had brought it had
left her, how she would kiss it, read it over and over again, press to
her heart the lucky paper which would have brought her ease of mind,
tranquillity, and perfect happiness. At all events, if the king did not
come, if the king did not write, he could not do otherwise than send
Saint-Aignan, or Saint-Aignan could not do otherwise than come of his
own accord. Even if it were a third person, how openly she would speak
to him; the royal presence would not be there to freeze her words upon
her tongue, and then no suspicious feeling would remain a moment longer
in the kingâ€™s heart.
Everything with La Valliere, heart and look, body and mind, was
concentrated in eager expectation. She said to herself that there was an
hour left in which to indulge hope; that until midnight struck, the
king might come, or write or send; that at midnight only would every
expectation vanish, every hope be lost. Whenever she heard any stir in
the palace, the poor girl fancied she was the cause of it; whenever
she heard any one pass in the courtyard below she imagined they were
messengers of the king coming to her. Eleven oâ€™clock struck, then a
quarter-past eleven; then half-past. The minutes dragged slowly on
in this anxiety, and yet they seemed to pass too quickly. And now, it
struck a quarter to twelve. Midnight--midnight was near, the last, the
final hope that remained. With the last stroke of the clock, the last
ray of light seemed to fade away; and with the last ray faded her final
hope. And so, the king himself had deceived her; it was he who had been
the first to fail in keeping the oath which he had sworn that very day;
twelve hours only between his oath and his perjured vow; it was not long,
alas! to have preserved the illusion. And so, not only did the king not
love her, but he despised her whom every one ill-treated, he despised
her to the extent even of abandoning her to the shame of an expulsion
which was equivalent to having an ignominious sentence passed on her;
and yet, it was he, the king himself, who was the first cause of this
ignominy. A bitter smile, the only symptom of anger which during this
long conflict had passed across the angelic face, appeared upon her
lips. What, in fact, now remained on earth for her, after the king was
lost to her? Nothing. But Heaven still remained, and her thoughts flew
thither. She prayed that the proper course for her to follow might be

recesses of that chamber, they would have seen the poor despairing girl
adopt a final resolution, and determine upon one last plan in her mind.
Then, as her knees were no longer able to support her, she gradually
sank down upon the _prie-Dieu_, and with her head pressed against the
wooden cross, her eyes fixed, and her respiration short and quick, she
watched for the earliest rays of approaching daylight. At two oâ€™clock
in the morning she was still in the same bewilderment of mind, or rather
the same ecstasy of feeling. Her thoughts had almost ceased to hold
communion with things of the world. And when she saw the pale violet
tints of early dawn visible over the roofs of the palace, and vaguely
revealing the outlines of the ivory crucifix which she held embraced,
she rose from the ground with a new-born strength, kissed the feet of
the divine martyr, descended the staircase leading from the room, and
wrapped herself from head to foot in a mantle as she went along. She
reached the wicket at the very moment the guard of the musketeers opened
the gate to admit the first relief-guard belonging to one of the Swiss
regiments. And then, gliding behind the soldiers, she reached the street
before the officer in command of the patrol had even thought of asking
who the young girl was who was making her escape from the palace at so
early an hour.
Chapter XXVI. The Flight.
La Valliere followed the patrol as it left the courtyard. The
patrol bent its steps towards the right, by the Rue St. Honore,
and mechanically La Valliere turned to the left. Her resolution was
taken--her determination fixed; she wished to betake herself to the
convent of the Carmelites at Chaillot, the superior of which enjoyed
a reputation for severity which made the worldly-minded people of the
court tremble. La Valliere had never seen Paris, she had never gone out
on foot, and so would have been unable to find her way even had she been
in a calmer frame of mind than was then the case; and this may explain
why she ascended, instead of descending, the Rue St. Honore. Her only
thought was to get away from the Palais Royal, and this she was doing;
she had heard it said that Chaillot looked out upon the Seine, and she
accordingly directed her steps towards the Seine. She took the Rue de
Coq, and not being able to cross the Louvre, bore towards the church of
Saint Germain lâ€™Auxerrois, proceeding along the site of the colonnade
which was subsequently built there by Perrault. In a very short time she
reached the quays. Her steps were rapid and agitated; she scarcely felt
the weakness which reminded her of having sprained her foot when very
young, and which obliged her to limp slightly. At any other hour in
the day her countenance would have awakened the suspicions of the least
clear-sighted, attracted the attention of the most indifferent. But at
half-past two in the morning, the streets of Paris are almost, if not
quite, deserted, and scarcely is any one to be seen but the hard-working
artisan on his way to earn his daily bread or the roistering idlers of
the streets, who are returning to their homes after a night of riot and
debauchery; for the former the day was beginning, and for the latter
it was just closing. La Valliere was afraid of both faces, in which her
ignorance of Parisian types did not permit her to distinguish the type
of probity from that of dishonesty. The appearance of misery alarmed
her, and all she met seemed either vile or miserable. Her dress, which
was the same she had worn during the previous evening, was elegant even
in its careless disorder; for it was the one in which she had presented
herself to the queen-mother; and, moreover, when she drew aside the
mantle which covered her face, in order to enable her to see the way she
was going, her pallor and her beautiful eyes spoke an unknown language
to the men she met, and, unconsciously, the poor fugitive seemed
to invite the brutal remarks of the one class, or to appeal to the
compassion of the other. La Valliere still walked on in the same way,
breathless and hurried, until she reached the top of the Place de Greve.
She stopped from time to time, placed her hand upon her heart, leaned
against a wall until she could breathe freely again, and then continued
on her course more rapidly than before. On reaching the Place de Greve
La Valliere suddenly came upon a group of three drunken men, reeling and
staggering along, who were just leaving a boat which they had made fast
to the quay; the boat was freighted with wines, and it was apparent that
they had done ample justice to the merchandise. They were celebrating
their convivial exploits in three different keys, when suddenly, as they
reached the end of the railing leading down to the quay, they found an
obstacle in their path, in the shape of this young girl. La Valliere
stopped; while they, on their part, at the appearance of the young girl
dressed in court costume, also halted, and seizing each other by the
hand, they surrounded La Valliere, singing,--
â€œOh! all ye weary wights, who mope alone, Come drink, and sing and

La Valliere at once understood that the men were insulting her, and
wished to prevent her passing; she tried to do so several times, but
her efforts were useless. Her limbs failed her; she felt she was on the
point of falling, and uttered a cry of terror. At the same moment
the circle which surrounded her was suddenly broken through in a most
violent manner. One of her insulters was knocked to the left, another
fell rolling over and over to the right, close to the waterâ€™s edge,
while the third could hardly keep his feet. An officer of the musketeers
stood face to face with the young girl, with threatening brow and hand
raised to carry out his threat. The drunken fellows, at sight of the
uniform, made their escape with what speed their staggering limbs could
lend them, all the more eagerly for the proof of strength which the
wearer of the uniform had just afforded them.
NA
NA
La Valliere, bewildered by what had just happened, and confounded by
hearing her name pronounced, looked up and recognized Dâ€™Artagnan. â€œOh,

NA

â€œMost certainly I will protect you; but, in Heavenâ€™s name, where are you
NA
NA
â€œYou are going to Chaillot by way of La Rapee! why, mademoiselle, you

â€œIn that case, monsieur, be kind enough to put me in the right way, and

â€œBut how does it happen that I have found you here? By what merciful
intervention were you sent to my assistance? I almost seem to be

â€œI happened to be here, mademoiselle, because I have a house in the

to receive yesterday, and where I, in fact, passed the night. And I
also wished to be at the palace early, for the purposes of inspecting my

offered her his arm, which she took, and began to walk with increased
precipitation, which ill-concealed, however, her weakness. Dâ€™Artagnan
perceived it, and proposed to La Valliere that she should take a little
rest, which she refused.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan did not reply; he could tell, merely by the tone of a voice,
when a resolution was real or not. He rather bore along rather than
accompanied La Valliere, until they perceived the elevated ground of
Chaillot.
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes; and since Heaven has directed you towards me to give me your

recollections of Fontainebleau; it said to her, â€œ_You_, who might be
happy with Raoul; _you_, who might be powerful with Louis; _you_ about

NA
â€œBut are you not mistaken with regard to your vocation,--are you not

â€œNo, since Heaven has been pleased to throw you in my way. Had it not
been for you, I should certainly have sunk from fatigue on the road, and
since Heaven, I repeat, has thrown you in my way, it is because it has

have one last favor to ask of you, even while I return you my thanks.
The king is entirely ignorant of my flight from the Palais Royal, and is
NA
NA
mademoiselle; you are not aware of what you are doing. No one ought to
do anything with which the king is unacquainted, especially those who
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan looked at the young girl with increasing astonishment.
NA
everything; and were it not so, it would now be too late to reconsider
NA
NA
â€œIn the name of that sympathy which misfortune inspires, by your
generous feeling, and by your honor as a gentleman, I entreat you to
NA
NA
â€œSwear to me, Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan, that you will not tell the king that

â€œBecause I know the king, I know you, I know myself even, nay, the whole

NA

have implored for you until my dying day, I will invoke a curse, for you
NA
We have already observed that Dâ€™Artagnan could easily recognize the
accents of truth and sincerity, and he could not resist this last
appeal. He saw by her face how bitterly she suffered from a feeling of
degradation, he remarked her trembling limbs, how her whole slight and
delicate frame was violently agitated by some internal struggle, and
clearly perceived that resistance might be fatal. â€œI will do as you
NA
NA
NA
NA
And in her extreme delight she seized hold of Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s hands
and pressed them between her own. Dâ€™Artagnan, who felt himself quite
overcome, said: â€œThis is touching, upon my word; she begins where others
NA
And La Valliere, who, in the bitterness of her distress, had sunk upon
the ground, rose and walked towards the convent of the Carmelites,
which could now, in the dawning light, be perceived just before them.
Dâ€™Artagnan followed her at a distance. The entrance-door was half-open;
she glided in like a shadow, and thanking Dâ€™Artagnan by a parting
gesture, disappeared from his sight. When Dâ€™Artagnan found himself quite
alone, he reflected very profoundly upon what had just taken place.
NA
false position. To keep such a secret as that, is to keep a burning coal
in oneâ€™s breeches-pocket, and trust that it may not burn the stuff.
And yet, not to keep it when I have sworn to do so is dishonorable. It
generally happens that some bright idea or other occurs to me as I am
going along; but I am very much mistaken if I shall not, now, have to go
a long way in order to find the solution of this affair. Yes, but which
way to go? Oh! towards Paris, of course; that is the best way, after
all. Only one must make haste, and in order to make haste four legs are
better than two, and I, unhappily, only have two. â€˜A horse, a horse,â€™ as
I heard them say at the theatre in London, â€˜my kingdom for a horse!â€™
And now I think of it, it need not cost me so much as that, for at the

So, in pursuance of this resolution, which he adopted with his usual
rapidity, Dâ€™Artagnan immediately turned his back upon the heights of
Chaillot, reached the guard-house, took the fastest horse he could find
there, and was at the palace in less than ten minutes. It was striking
five as he reached the Palais Royal. The king, he was told, had gone to
bed at his usual hour, having been long engaged with M. Colbert, and, in

spoke the truth; the king is ignorant of everything; if he only knew
one-half of what has happened, the Palais Royal by this time would be

Chapter XXVII. Showing How Louis, on His Part, Had Passed the Time from
Ten to Half-Past Twelve at Night.
When the king left the apartments of the maids of honor, he found
Colbert awaiting him to take directions for the next dayâ€™s ceremony, as
the king was then to receive the Dutch and Spanish ambassadors. Louis
XIV. had serious causes of dissatisfaction with the Dutch; the States
had already been guilty of many mean shifts and evasions with France,
and without perceiving or without caring about the chances of a rupture,
they again abandoned the alliance with his Most Christian Majesty, for
the purpose of entering into all kinds of plots with Spain. Louis XIV.
at his accession, that is to say, at the death of Cardinal Mazarin, had
found this political question roughly sketched out; the solution was
difficult for a young man, but as, at that time, the king represented
the whole nation, anything that the head resolved upon, the body would
be found ready to carry out. Any sudden impulse of anger, the reaction
of young hot blood upon the brain, would be quite sufficient to change
an old form of policy and create another system altogether. The part
that diplomatists had to play in those days was that of arranging among
themselves the different _coups-dâ€™etat_ which their sovereign masters
might wish to effect. Louis was not in that calm frame of mind which was
necessary to enable him to determine on a wise course of policy. Still
much agitated from the quarrel he had just had with La Valliere,
he walked hastily into his cabinet, dimly desirous of finding an
opportunity of producing an explosion after he had controlled himself
for so long a time. Colbert, as he saw the king enter, knew the position
of affairs at a glance, understood the kingâ€™s intentions, and resolved
therefore to maneuver a little. When Louis requested to be informed what
it would be necessary to say on the morrow, Colbert began by expressing
his surprise that his majesty had not been properly informed by M.
NA
NA
The king, who was accustomed to hear M. Colbert speak in not
over-scrupulous terms of M. Fouquet, allowed this remark to pass
unanswered, and merely listened. Colbert noticed the effect it had
produced, and hastened to back out, saying that M. Fouquet was not on
all occasions as blamable as at the first glance might seem to be the
case, inasmuch as at that moment he was greatly occupied. The king
NA
â€œSire, men are but men, and M. Fouquet has his defects as well as his
NA
NA
NA
a good deal of flattery in a light amount of blame, like the arrow which
cleaves the air notwithstanding its weight, thanks to the light feathers
which bear it up.
NA
NA
NA
â€œI am not quite sure, sire; I have very little to do with matters of

NA
NA
NA
â€œI cannot now remember whose, but I think it is one of Madameâ€™s maids of

murmured.
NA
â€œAt all events, Madameâ€™s maids of honor are all known, and in mentioning
NA
NA
NA
â€œIt would be useless, sire. Whenever the name of any lady who runs the
risk of being compromised is concerned, my memory is like a coffer of

A dark cloud seemed to pass over the mind as well as across the face
of the king; then, wishing to appear as if he were perfect master of
himself and his feelings, he said, â€œAnd now for the affair concerning
NA
â€œIn the first place, sire, at what hour will your majesty receive the

NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œFor friends, that would be a matter of no importance; one does what one
likes with oneâ€™s friends; but for oneâ€™s enemies, in that case nothing
could be better than if they _were_ to feel hurt. I should not be sorry,
I confess, to have to finish altogether with these marsh-birds, who
NA
â€œIt shall be precisely as your majesty desires. At nine oâ€™clock,
therefore--I will give the necessary orders. Is it to be a formal
NA
â€œNo. I wish to have an explanation with them, and not to embitter
matters, as is always the case when many persons are present, but, at
the same time, I wish to clear up everything with them, in order not to
NA
â€œYour majesty will inform me of the persons whom you wish to be present
NA
â€œI will draw out a list. Let us speak of the ambassadors; what do they
NA
â€œAllies with Spain, they gain nothing; allies with France, they lose
NA
NA
â€œAllied with Spain, they see themselves bounded and protected by the
possessions of their allies; they cannot touch them, however anxious
they may be to do so. From Antwerp to Rotterdam is but a step, and that
by the way of the Scheldt and the Meuse. If they wish to make a bite at
the Spanish cake, you, sire, the son-in-law of the king of Spain, could
with your cavalry sweep the earth from your dominions to Brussels in a
couple of days. Their design is, therefore, only to quarrel so far with
you, and only to make you suspect Spain so far, as will be sufficient to
NA
NA
â€œto form a solid alliance with me, by means of which I should gain
NA
â€œNot so; for if, by chance, they were to have you, or France rather, as
a boundary, your majesty is not an agreeable neighbor. Young, ardent,
warlike, the king of France might inflict some serious mischief on
NA
â€œI perfectly understand, M. Colbert, and you have explained it very
clearly; but be good enough to tell me the conclusion you have arrived
NA
NA
NA
â€œThey will tell your majesty that they are ardently desirous of forming
an alliance with you, which will be a falsehood: they will tell Spain
that the three powers ought to unite so as to check the prosperity
of England, and that will equally be a falsehood; for at present, the
natural ally of your majesty is England, who has ships while we have
none; England, who can counteract Dutch influence in India; England, in
fact, a monarchical country, to which your majesty is attached by ties
NA
NA
â€œI should answer, sire, with the greatest possible moderation of tone,
that the disposition of Holland does not seem friendly towards the
Court of France; that the symptoms of public feeling among the Dutch are
alarming as regards your majesty; that certain medals have been struck
NA
NA
â€œOh, no! sire, no; insulting is not the word; I was mistaken, I ought to
NA
â€œOh! if that be so, the pride of the Dutch is a matter of indifference
NA
â€œYour majesty is right, a thousand times right. However, it is never
a mistake in politics, your majesty knows better than myself, to
exaggerate a little in order to obtain a concession in your own
favor. If your majesty were to complain as if your susceptibility were
NA
NA
NA
â€œUpon my word, sire, I cannot very well tell you--some overweeningly
conceited device--that is the sense of it; the words have little to do
NA
â€œVery good! I will mention the word â€˜medal,â€™ and they can understand it
NA
â€œOh! they will understand without any difficulty. Your majesty can also
NA
â€œNever! Pamphlets befoul those who write them much more than those
against whom they are written. M. Colbert, I thank you. You can leave
NA
NA
NA
of the list in the least. The clock struck half-past eleven. The kingâ€™s
face revealed a violent conflict between pride and love. The political
conversation had dispelled a good deal of the irritation which Louis had
felt, and La Valliereâ€™s pale, worn features, in his imagination, spoke
a very different language from that of the Dutch medals, or the Batavian
pamphlets. He sat for ten minutes debating within himself whether he
should or should not return to La Valliere; but Colbert having with some
urgency respectfully requested that the list might be furnished him,
the king was ashamed to be thinking of mere matters of affection where
important state affairs required his attention. He therefore dictated:
the queen-mother, the queen, Madame, Madame de Motteville, Madame de
Chatillon, Madame de Navailles; and, for the men, M. le Prince, M. de
Gramont, M. de Manicamp, M. de Saint-Aignan, and the officers on duty.
NA
NA
â€œSire, I will leave at once in order to get everything prepared; the
NA
NA
twelve. It was the very hour when poor La Valliere was almost dying from
anguish and bitter suffering. The kingâ€™s attendants entered, it being
the hour of his retirement to his chamber; the queen, indeed, had
been waiting for more than an hour. Louis accordingly retreated to his
bedroom with a sigh; but, as he sighed, he congratulated himself on his
courage, and applauded himself for having been as firm in love as in
affairs of state.
Chapter XXVIII. The Ambassadors.
Dâ€™Artagnan had, with very few exceptions, learned almost all of the
particulars of what we have just been relating; for among his friends
he reckoned all the useful, serviceable people in the royal
household,--officious attendants who were proud of being recognized
by the captain of the musketeers, for the captainâ€™s influence was
very great; and then, in addition to any ambitious views they may have
imagined he could promote, they were proud of being regarded as
worth being spoken to by a man as brave as Dâ€™Artagnan. In this manner
Dâ€™Artagnan learned every morning what he had not been able either to see
or to ascertain the night before, from the simple fact of his not being
ubiquitous; so that, with the information he had been able by his own
means to pick up during the day, and with what he had gathered from
others, he succeeded in making up a bundle of weapons, which he was in
the prudent habit of using only when occasion required. In this way,
Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s two eyes rendered him the same service as the hundred eyes
of Argus. Political secrets, bedside revelations, hints or scraps of
conversation dropped by the courtiers on the threshold of the royal
ante-chamber, in this way Dâ€™Artagnan managed to ascertain, and to store
away everything in the vast and impenetrable mausoleum of his memory,
by the side of those royal secrets so dearly bought and faithfully
preserved. He therefore knew of the kingâ€™s interview with Colbert,
and of the appointment made for the ambassadors in the morning, and,
consequently, that the question of the medals would be brought up for
debate; and, while he was arranging and constructing the conversation
upon a few chance words which had reached his ears, he returned to his
post in the royal apartments, so as to be there at the very moment the
king awoke. It happened that the king rose very early,--proving thereby
that he, too, on his side, had slept but indifferently. Towards seven
oâ€™clock, he half-opened his door very gently. Dâ€™Artagnan was at his
post. His majesty was pale, and seemed wearied; he had not, moreover,
quite finished dressing.
NA
Saint-Aignan was probably awaiting a summons, for the messenger, when he
reached his apartment, found him already dressed. Saint-Aignan hastened
to the king in obedience to the summons. A moment afterwards the king
and Saint-Aignan passed by together--the king walking first. Dâ€™Artagnan
went to the window which looked out upon the courtyard; he had no need
to put himself to the trouble of watching in what direction the king
went, for he had no difficulty in guessing beforehand where his majesty
was going. The king, in fact, bent his steps towards the apartments
of the maids of honor,--a circumstance which in no way astonished
Dâ€™Artagnan, for he more than suspected, although La Valliere had not
breathed a syllable on the subject, that the king had some kind of
reparation to make. Saint-Aignan followed him as he had done the
previous evening, rather less uneasy in his mind, though still slightly
agitated, for he fervently trusted that at seven oâ€™clock in the morning
there might be only himself and the king awake amongst the august guests
at the palace. Dâ€™Artagnan stood at the window, careless and perfectly
calm in his manner. One could almost have sworn that he noticed nothing,
and was utterly ignorant who were these two hunters after adventures,
passing like shadows across the courtyard, wrapped up in their cloaks.
And yet, all the while that Dâ€™Artagnan appeared not to be looking at
them at all, he did not for one moment lose sight of them, and while
he whistled that old march of the musketeers, which he rarely recalled
except under great emergencies, he conjectured and prophesied how
terrible would be the storm which would be raised on the kingâ€™s return.
In fact, when the king entered La Valliereâ€™s apartment and found the
room empty and the bed untouched, he began to be alarmed, and called out
to Montalais, who immediately answered the summons; but her astonishment
was equal to the kingâ€™s. All that she could tell his majesty was, that
she had fancied she had heard La Valliereâ€™s weeping during a portion of
the night, but, knowing that his majesty had paid her a visit, she had
not dared to inquire what was the matter.
NA
NA
and as I have often seen her rise at daybreak in order to go out into
NA
This appeared probable, and the king immediately ran down the staircase
in search of the fugitive. Dâ€™Artagnan saw him grow very pale, and
talking in an excited manner with his companion, as he went towards the
gardens; Saint-Aignan following him, out of breath. Dâ€™Artagnan did
not stir from the window, but went on whistling, looking as if he saw
NA
disappeared, â€œhis majestyâ€™s passion is stronger than I thought; he is
NA
In a quarter of an hour the king again appeared: he had looked
everywhere, was completely out of breath, and, as a matter of course,
had not discovered anything. Saint-Aignan, who still followed him,
was fanning himself with his hat, and in a gasping voice, asking for
information about La Valliere from such of the servants as were about,
in fact from every one he met. Among others he came across Manicamp,
who had arrived from Fontainebleau by easy stages; for whilst others had
performed the journey in six hours, he had taken four and twenty.
NA
Whereupon Manicamp, dreamy and absent as usual, answered, thinking that
some one was asking him about De Guiche, â€œThank you, the comte is a
NA
And he continued on his way until he reached the ante-chamber where
Dâ€™Artagnan was, whom he asked to explain how it was that the king
looked, as he thought, so bewildered; to which Dâ€™Artagnan replied that
he was quite mistaken, that the king, on the contrary, was as lively and
merry as he could possibly be.
In the midst of all this, eight oâ€™clock struck. It was usual for the
king to take his breakfast at this hour, for the code of etiquette
prescribed that the king should always be hungry at eight oâ€™clock. His
breakfast was laid upon a small table in his bedroom, and he ate very
fast. Saint-Aignan, of whom he would not lose sight, waited on the
king. He then disposed of several military audiences, during which
he dispatched Saint-Aignan to see what he could find out. Then, still
occupied, full of anxiety, still watching Saint-Aignanâ€™s return, who had
sent out the servants in every direction, to make inquires, and who
had also gone himself, the hour of nine struck, and the king forthwith
passed into his large cabinet.
As the clock was striking nine the ambassadors entered, and as it
finished, the two queens and Madame made their appearance. There were
three ambassadors from Holland, and two from Spain. The king glanced at
them, and then bowed; and, at the same moment, Saint-Aignan entered,--an
entrance which the king regarded as far more important, in a different
sense, however, than that of ambassadors, however numerous they might
be, and from whatever country they came; and so, setting everything
aside, the king made a sign of interrogation to Saint-Aignan, which the
latter answered by a most decisive negative. The king almost entirely
lost his courage; but as the queens, the members of the nobility who
were present, and the ambassadors, had their eyes fixed upon him, he
overcame his emotion by a violent effort, and invited the latter to
speak. Whereupon one of the Spanish deputies made a long oration, in
which he boasted the advantages which the Spanish alliance would offer.
The king interrupted him, saying, â€œMonsieur, I trust that whatever is
NA
This remark, and particularly the peremptory tone in which it was
pronounced, made the ambassadors pale, and brought the color into the
cheeks of the two queens, who, being Spanish, felt wounded in their
pride of relationship and nationality by this reply.
The Dutch ambassador then began to address himself to the king, and
complained of the injurious suspicions which the king exhibited against
the government of his country.
The king interrupted him, saying, â€œIt is very singular, monsieur, that
you should come with any complaint, when it is I rather who have reason
NA
NA
NA
I should happen to entertain suspicions against a government which
NA
NA
NA
his own personal annoyance, rather than from political grounds, â€œthat
Holland is a land of refuge for all who hate me, and especially for all
NA
NA
â€œYou wish for proofs, perhaps? Very good; they can be had easily enough.
Whence proceed all those vile and insolent pamphlets which represent me
as a monarch without glory and without authority? your printing-presses
groan under their number. If my secretaries were here, I would mention
NA
NA
the work of a whole nation. Is it just, is it reasonable, that a great
and powerful monarch like your majesty should render a whole nation
responsible for the crime of a few madmen, who are, perhaps, only
NA
â€œThat may be the case, I admit. But when the mint itself, at Amsterdam,
strikes off medals which reflect disgrace upon me, is that also the
NA
NA
NA
NA
The king still looked at Colbert; but Colbert appeared not to understand
him, and maintained an unbroken silence, notwithstanding the kingâ€™s
repeated hints. Dâ€™Artagnan then approached the king, and taking a piece
of money out of his pocket, he placed it in the kingâ€™s hands, saying,
NA
The king looked at it, and with a look which, ever since he had become
his own master, was ever piercing as the eagleâ€™s, observed an insulting
device representing Holland arresting the progress of the sun, with this
NA
NA
NA
NA
of the cabinet, where the sun was brilliantly represented in every
NA
Louisâ€™s anger, increased by the bitterness of his own personal
sufferings, hardly required this additional circumstance to foment it.
Every one saw, from the kindling passion in the kingâ€™s eyes, that an
explosion was imminent. A look from Colbert kept postponed the bursting
of the storm. The ambassador ventured to frame excuses by saying that
the vanity of nations was a matter of little consequence; that Holland
was proud that, with such limited resources, she had maintained her rank
as a great nation, even against powerful monarchs, and that if a little
smoke had intoxicated his countrymen, the king would be kindly disposed,
and would even excuse this intoxication. The king seemed as if he
would be glad of some suggestion; he looked at Colbert, who remained
impassible; then at Dâ€™Artagnan, who simply shrugged his shoulders, a
movement which was like the opening of the flood-gates, whereby the
kingâ€™s anger, which he had restrained for so long a period, now burst
forth. As no one knew what direction his anger might take, all preserved
a dead silence. The second ambassador took advantage of it to begin his
excuses also. While he was speaking, and while the king, who had again
gradually returned to his own personal reflections, was automatically
listening to the voice, full of nervous anxiety, with the air of an
absent man listening to the murmuring of a cascade, Dâ€™Artagnan, on whose
left hand Saint-Aignan was standing, approached the latter, and, in a
voice which was loud enough to reach the kingâ€™s ears, said: â€œHave you
NA
NA
NA
The king started, and advanced his head.
NA
which can easily be imagined.
NA
NA
NA
but then, mindful of the rules of etiquette, he mastered himself, still
listening, however, with rapt attention.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The king did not lose a syllable of this conversation; and again he
could hardly control his feelings.
NA
NA
 replied Dâ€™Artagnan.
He had no sooner said this, than the king, with an authoritative
NA
advancing towards the captain, he exclaimed:
â€œWho says Mademoiselle de la Valliere is going to take the religious
NA
NA
NA
NA
The king clenched his hands, and turned pale.
NA
NA
â€œYou added that Mademoiselle de la Valliere had been driven away from
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
further.
The king almost bounded from his seat, regardless of ambassadors,
ministers, courtiers, queens, and politics. The queen-mother rose;
she had heard everything, or, if she had not heard everything, she had
guessed it. Madame, almost fainting from anger and fear, endeavored
to rise as the queen-mother had done; but she sank down again upon her
chair, which by an instinctive movement she made roll back a few paces.
NA
NA
imperious gesture, he dismissed the ambassadors.
NA
NA
NA
am not master of myself, I will be, I promise you, of those who do me a
NA
room in the midst of general stupefaction and dismay. The king hastily
descended the staircase, and was about to cross the courtyard.
NA
NA
NA
The kingâ€™s only answer was a look, but this look promised more than the
ambition of three Dâ€™Artagnans could have dared to hope.
Chapter XXIX. Chaillot.
Although they had not been summoned, Manicamp and Malicorne had followed
the king and Dâ€™Artagnan. They were both exceedingly intelligent men;
except that Malicorne was too precipitate, owing to ambition, while
Manicamp was frequently too tardy, owing to indolence. On this occasion,
however, they arrived at precisely the proper moment. Five horses were
in readiness. Two were seized upon by the king and Dâ€™Artagnan, two
others by Manicamp and Malicorne, while a groom belonging to the stables
mounted the fifth. The cavalcade set off at a gallop. Dâ€™Artagnan had
been very careful in his selection of the horses; they were the very
animals for distressed lovers--horses which did not simply run, but
flew. Within ten minutes after their departure, the cavalcade, amidst a
cloud of dust, arrived at Chaillot. The king literally threw himself off
his horse; but notwithstanding the rapidity with which he accomplished
this maneuver, he found Dâ€™Artagnan already holding his stirrup. With
a sign of acknowledgement to the musketeer, he threw the bridle to the
groom, and darted into the vestibule, violently pushed open the door,
and entered the reception-room. Manicamp, Malicorne, and the groom
remained outside, Dâ€™Artagnan alone following him. When he entered the
reception-room, the first object which met his gaze was Louise herself,
not simply on her knees, but lying at the foot of a large stone
crucifix. The young girl was stretched upon the damp flag-stones,
scarcely visible in the gloom of the apartment, which was lighted only
by means of a narrow window, protected by bars and completely shaded by
creeping plants. When the king saw her in this state, he thought she was
dead, and uttered a loud cry, which made Dâ€™Artagnan hurry into the
room. The king had already passed one of his arms round her body, and
Dâ€™Artagnan assisted him in raising the poor girl, whom the torpor of
death seemed already to have taken possession of. Dâ€™Artagnan seized hold
of the alarm-bell and rang with all his might. The Carmelite sisters
immediately hastened at the summons, and uttered loud exclamations of
alarm and indignation at the sight of the two men holding a woman in
their arms. The superior also hurried to the scene of action, but far
more a creature of the world than any of the female members of the
court, notwithstanding her austerity of manners, she recognized the king
at the first glance, by the respect which those present exhibited for
him, as well as by the imperious and authoritative way in which he had
thrown the whole establishment into confusion. As soon as she saw the
king, she retired to her own apartments, in order to avoid compromising
her dignity. But by one of the nuns she sent various cordials, Hungary
water, etc., etc., and ordered that all the doors should immediately be
closed, a command which was just in time, for the kingâ€™s distress was
fast becoming of a most clamorous and despairing character. He had
almost decided to send for his own physician, when La Valliere exhibited
signs of returning animation. The first object which met her gaze, as
she opened her eyes, was the king at her feet; in all probability she
did not recognize him, for she uttered a deep sigh full of anguish and
distress. Louis fixed his eyes devouringly upon her face; and when, in
the course of a few moments, she recognized Louis, she endeavored to
tear herself from his embrace.

notwithstanding he was flattered by the praise bestowed upon him.
La Valliere was overcome: after a little further hesitation, she allowed
herself to be led away, half fainting, by her royal lover. But, as she
was on the point of leaving the room, she tore herself from the kingâ€™s
grasp, and returned to the stone crucifix, which she kissed, saying,
â€œOh, Heaven! it was thou who drewest me hither! thou, who has rejected
me; but thy grace is infinite. Whenever I shall again return, forget
that I have ever separated myself from thee, for, when I return it will

The king could not restrain his emotion, and Dâ€™Artagnan, even, was
overcome. Louis led the young girl away, lifted her into the carriage,
and directed Dâ€™Artagnan to seat himself beside her, while he,
mounting his horse, spurred violently towards the Palais Royal, where,
immediately on his arrival, he sent to request an audience of Madame.
Chapter XXX. Madame.
From the manner in which the king had dismissed the ambassadors, even
the least clear-sighted persons belonging to the court imagined war
would ensue. The ambassadors themselves, but slightly acquainted with
the kingâ€™s domestic disturbances, had interpreted as directed against
themselves the celebrated sentence: â€œIf I be not master of myself, I, at
NA
France and Holland, Colbert had followed them out of the kingâ€™s presence
for the purpose of explaining matters to them; but the two queens and
Madame, who were perfectly aware of every particular that had taken
place in their several households, having heard the kingâ€™s remark, so
full of dark meaning, retired to their own apartments in no little fear
and chagrin. Madame, especially, felt that the royal anger might fall
upon her, and, as she was brave and exceedingly proud, instead of
seeking support and encouragement from the queen-mother, she had
returned to her own apartments, if not without some uneasiness, at least
without any intention of avoiding an encounter. Anne of Austria, from
time to time at frequent intervals, sent messages to learn if the king
had returned. The silence which the whole palace preserved upon the
matter, and upon Louiseâ€™s disappearance, was indicative of a long train
of misfortunes to all those who knew the haughty and irritable humor of
the king. But Madame, unmoved in spite of all the flying rumors, shut
herself up in her apartments, sent for Montalais, and, with a voice as
calm as she could possibly command, desired her to relate all she knew
about the event itself. At the moment that the eloquent Montalais
was concluding, with all kinds of oratorical precautions, and was
recommending, if not in actual language, at least in spirit, that she
should show forbearance towards La Valliere, M. Malicorne made his
appearance to beg an audience of Madame, on behalf of the king.
Montalaisâ€™s worthy friend bore upon his countenance all the signs of the
very liveliest emotion. It was impossible to be mistaken; the interview
which the king requested would be one of the most interesting chapters
in the history of the hearts of kings and of men. Madame was disturbed
by her brother-in-lawâ€™s arrival; she did not expect it so soon, nor
had she, indeed, expected any direct step on Louisâ€™s part. Besides,
all women who wage war successfully by indirect means, are invariably
neither very skillful nor very strong when it becomes a question of
accepting a pitched battle. Madame, however, was not one who ever drew
back; she had the very opposite defect or qualification, in whichever
light it may be considered; she took an exaggerated view of what
constituted real courage; and therefore the kingâ€™s message, of which
Malicorne had been the bearer, was regarded by her as the bugle-note
proclaiming the commencement of hostilities. She, therefore, boldly
accepted the gage of battle. Five minutes afterwards the king ascended
the staircase. His color was heightened from having ridden hard. His
dusty and disordered clothes formed a singular contrast with the fresh
and perfectly arranged toilette of Madame, who, notwithstanding the
rouge on her cheeks, turned pale as Louis entered the room. Louis
lost no time in approaching the object of his visit; he sat down, and
Montalais disappeared.

The king became crimson, and his eyes kindled with a fire which it
required all Madameâ€™s courage to support. He mastered his anger,
however, and continued: â€œA stronger reason than that is surely
requisite, for one so good and kind as you are, to turn away and
dishonor, not only the young girl herself, but every member of her
family as well. You know that the whole city has its eyes fixed upon the
conduct of the female portion of the court. To dismiss a maid of honor
is to attribute a crime to her--at the very least a fault. What crime,

It sometimes happens that in a battle a chance ball may reach its
mark. The observation which the king had made without any particular
intention, struck Madame home, and staggered her for a moment; some
day or other she might indeed have reason to dread reprisals. â€œAt all
NA
â€œI ask, madame, what has Mademoiselle de la Valliere done to warrant

the king rose and gave free vent to his tears, which, in fact, were
tears of anger and shame.
Madame was not touched exactly--for the best women, when their pride is
hurt, are without pity; but she was afraid that the tears the king was
shedding might possibly carry away every soft and tender feeling in his
heart.

The king rose suddenly to his feet. By this word, which had so
infelicitously escaped her, Madame had destroyed the whole merit of her
sacrifice. The king felt freed from all obligations. Exasperated beyond
measure, and bitterly offended, he replied:
â€œI thank you, Madame; I shall never forget the service you have rendered

Chapter XXXI. Mademoiselle de la Valliereâ€™s Pocket-Handkerchief.
Madame was not bad-hearted--she was only hasty and impetuous. The king
was not imprudent--he was simply in love. Hardly had they entered into
this compact, which terminated in La Valliereâ€™s recall, when they both
sought to make as much as they could by their bargain. The king wished
to see La Valliere every moment of the day, while Madame, who was
sensible of the kingâ€™s annoyance ever since he had so entreated her,
would not relinquish her revenge on La Valliere without a contest. She
planted every conceivable difficulty in the kingâ€™s path; he was,
in fact, obliged, in order to get a glimpse of La Valliere, to be
exceedingly devoted in his attentions to his sister-in-law, and this,
indeed, was Madameâ€™s plan of policy. As she had chosen some one to
second her efforts, and as this person was our old friend Montalais,
the king found himself completely hemmed in every time he paid Madame
a visit; he was surrounded, and was never left a moment alone. Madame
displayed in her conversation a charm of manner and brilliancy of wit
which dazzled everybody. Montalais followed her, and soon rendered
herself perfectly insupportable to the king, which was, in fact, the
very thing she expected would happen. She then set Malicorne at the
king, who found means of informing his majesty that there was a young
person belonging to the court who was exceedingly miserable; and on
the king inquiring who this person was, Malicorne replied that it
was Mademoiselle de Montalais. To this the king answered that it was
perfectly just that a person should be unhappy when she rendered others
so. Whereupon Malicorne explained how matters stood; for he had received
his directions from Montalais. The king began to open his eyes; he
remarked that, as soon as he made his appearance, Madame made hers too;
that she remained in the corridors until after he had left; that she
accompanied him back to his own apartments, fearing that he might speak
in the ante-chambers to one of her maids of honor. One evening she went
further still. The king was seated, surrounded by the ladies who were
present, and holding in his hand, concealed by his lace ruffle, a small
note which he wished to slip into La Valliereâ€™s hand. Madame guessed
both his intention and the letter too. It was difficult to prevent the
king going wherever he pleased, and yet it was necessary to prevent his
going near La Valliere, or speaking to her, as by so doing he could
let the note fall into her lap behind her fan, or into her
pocket-handkerchief. The king, who was also on the watch, suspected that
a snare was being laid for him. He rose and pushed his chair, without
affectation, near Mademoiselle de Chatillon, with whom he began to
talk in a light tone. They were amusing themselves making rhymes; from
Mademoiselle de Chatillon he went to Montalais, and then to Mademoiselle
de Tonnay-Charente. And thus, by this skillful maneuver, he found
himself seated opposite to La Valliere, whom he completely concealed.
Madame pretended to be greatly occupied, altering a group of flowers
that she was working in tapestry. The king showed the corner of his
letter to La Valliere, and the latter held out her handkerchief with

placed his own handkerchief upon his chair, he was adroit enough to let
it fall on the ground, so that La Valliere slipped her handkerchief on
the chair. The king took it up quietly, without any one observing what
he did, placed the letter within it, and returned the handkerchief to
the place he had taken it from. There was only just time for La Valliere
to stretch out her hand to take hold of the handkerchief with its
valuable contents.
But Madame, who had observed everything that had passed, said to
Mademoiselle de Chatillon, â€œChatillon, be good enough to pick up the
NA
The young girl obeyed with the utmost precipitation, the king having
moved from his seat, and La Valliere being in no little degree nervous
and confused.
NA
NA
And the king was accordingly obliged to put into his pocket La
Valliereâ€™s handkerchief as well as his own. He certainly gained that
souvenir of Louise, who lost, however, a copy of verses which had cost
the king ten hoursâ€™ hard labor, and which, as far as he was concerned,
was perhaps as good as a long poem. It would be impossible to describe
the kingâ€™s anger and La Valliereâ€™s despair; but shortly afterwards a
circumstance occurred which was more than remarkable. When the king
left, in order to retire to his own apartments, Malicorne, informed
of what had passed, one can hardly tell how, was waiting in the
ante-chamber. The ante-chambers of the Palais Royal are naturally very
dark, and, in the evening, they were but indifferently lighted. Nothing
pleased the king more than this dim light. As a general rule, love,
whose mind and heart are constantly in a blaze, contemns all light,
except the sunshine of the soul. And so the ante-chamber was dark; a
page carried a torch before the king, who walked on slowly, greatly
annoyed at what had recently occurred. Malicorne passed close to the
king, almost stumbled against him in fact, and begged his forgiveness
with the profoundest humility; but the king, who was in an exceedingly
ill-temper, was very sharp in his reproof to Malicorne, who disappeared
as soon and as quietly as he possibly could. Louis retired to rest,
having had a misunderstanding with the queen; and the next day, as soon
as he entered the cabinet, he wished to have La Valliereâ€™s handkerchief
in order to press his lips to it. He called his valet.
NA
NA
The order being obeyed, the king himself searched the pocket of the
coat; he found only one handkerchief, and that his own; La Valliereâ€™s
had disappeared. Whilst busied with all kinds of conjectures and
suspicions, a letter was brought to him from La Valliere; it ran thus:
â€œHow good and kind of you to have sent me those beautiful verses; how
full of ingenuity and perseverance your affection is; how is it possible
NA
NA
NA
must be in one of my pockets; and if you do not find it, or if you have
NA
loss of the handkerchief would be to act absurdly, and he therefore
added, â€œThere was a letter of some importance inside the handkerchief,
NA
NA
NA
NA
poverty, how I envy you! Happy is the man who can empty his own pockets
NA
He read La Valliereâ€™s letter over again, endeavoring to imagine in what
conceivable way his verses could have reached their destination. There
was a postscript to the letter:
â€œI send you back by your messenger this reply, so unworthy of what you
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Malicorne entered.

NA
NA
NA

does Mademoiselle de la Valliere call you my messenger? What did you
NA
â€œSire, I merely took Mademoiselle de la Valliere a pocket-handkerchief,
NA
NA
â€œSire, at the very moment when I had the misfortune to stumble against
your majesty yesterday--a misfortune which I shall deplore to the
last day of my life, especially after the dissatisfaction which you
exhibited--I remained, sire, motionless with despair, your majesty being
at too great a distance to hear my excuses, when I saw something white
NA
NA
â€œI stooped down,--it was a pocket-handkerchief. For a moment I had an
idea that when I stumbled against your majesty I must have been the
cause of the handkerchief falling from your pocket; but as I felt it all
over very respectfully, I perceived a cipher at one of the corners,
and, on looking at it closely, I found that it was Mademoiselle de la
Valliereâ€™s cipher. I presumed that on her way to Madameâ€™s apartment in
the earlier part of the evening she had let her handkerchief fall, and
I accordingly hastened to restore it to her as she was leaving; and that
is all I gave to Mademoiselle de la Valliere, I entreat your majesty to

marked with such extreme humility, that the king was greatly amused in
listening to him. He was as pleased with him for what he had done as if
he had rendered him the greatest service.
NA
NA
The plain and sober truth was, that Malicorne had picked the kingâ€™s
pocket of the handkerchief as dexterously as any of the pickpockets of
the good city of Paris could have done. Madame never knew of this little
incident, but Montalais gave La Valliere some idea of the manner in
which it had really happened, and La Valliere afterwards told the king,
who laughed exceedingly at it and pronounced Malicorne to be a first
rate politician. Louis XIV. was right, and it is well known that he was
tolerably well acquainted with human nature.
Chapter XXXII. Which Treats of Gardeners, of Ladders, and Maids of
Honor.
Miracles, unfortunately, could not be always happening, whilst Madameâ€™s
ill-humor still continued. In a weekâ€™s time, matters had reached such a
point, that the king could no longer look at La Valliere without a look
full of suspicion crossing his own. Whenever a promenade was proposed,
Madame, in order to avoid the recurrence of similar scenes to that of
the thunder-storm, or the royal oak, had a variety of indispositions
ready prepared; and, thanks to them, she was unable to go out, and her
maids of honor were obliged to remain indoors also. There was not the
slightest chance of means of paying a nocturnal visit; for in this
respect the king had, on the very first occasion, experienced a severe
check, which happened in the following manner. As at Fontainebleau, he
had taken Saint-Aignan with him one evening when he wished to pay
La Valliere a visit; but he had found no one but Mademoiselle de
NA
such a manner that a perfect legion of chamber-maids, attendants, and
pages, ran to her assistance; so that Saint-Aignan, who had remained
behind in order to save the honor of his royal master, who had fled
precipitately, was obliged to submit to a severe scolding from the
queen-mother, as well as from Madame herself. In addition, he had, the
next morning, received two challenges from the De Mortemart family, and
the king had been obliged to interfere. This mistake had been owing
to the circumstance of Madame having suddenly ordered a change in the
apartments of her maids of honor, and directed La Valliere and Montalais
to sleep in her own cabinet. No gateway, therefore, was any longer
open--not even communication by letter; to write under the eyes of
so ferocious an Argus as Madame, whose temper and disposition were so
uncertain, was to run the risk of exposure to the greatest danger; and
it can well be conceived into what a state of continuous irritation, and
ever increasing anger, all these petty annoyances threw the young lion.
The king almost tormented himself to death endeavoring to discover a
means of communication; and, as he did not think proper to call in the
aid of Malicorne or Dâ€™Artagnan, the means were not discovered at all.
Malicorne had, indeed, occasional brilliant flashes of imagination, with
which he tried to inspire the king with confidence; but, whether from
shame or suspicion, the king, who had at first begun to nibble at the
bait, soon abandoned the hook. In this way, for instance, one evening,
while the king was crossing the garden, and looking up at Madameâ€™s
windows, Malicorne stumbled over a ladder lying beside a border of box,
and said to Manicamp, then walking with him behind the king, â€œDid you
not see that I just now stumbled against a ladder, and was nearly thrown
NA
NA
NA
â€œThat doesnâ€™t matter; but it is not on that account the less dangerous
NA
â€œTrue, one might hurt oneâ€™s self, especially when troubled with fits of
NA
â€œI donâ€™t mean that; what I did mean, was that it is dangerous to allow

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
answering, was dreaming of something else.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œOh! I donâ€™t say that any one would ever venture to go up a ladder into
Madameâ€™s room; but in Madameâ€™s cabinet, merely separated by a partition,
sleep two exceedingly pretty girls, Mesdemoiselles de la Valliere and de
NA
NA
â€œLook; you see how brilliantly lighted Madameâ€™s apartments are--well, do
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, that is the room of the maids of honor. Look, there is
Mademoiselle de la Valliere opening the window. Ah! how many soft things
could an enterprising lover say to her, if he only suspected that there
was lying here a ladder nineteen feet long, which would just reach the
NA
NA
â€œMademoiselle de Montalais counts for nothing; she is her oldest friend,
and exceedingly devoted to her--a positive well, into which can be

The king did not lose a single syllable of this conversation. Malicorne
even remarked that his majesty slackened his pace, in order to give him
time to finish. So, when they arrived at the door, Louis dismissed every
one, with the exception of Malicorne--a circumstance which excited no
surprise, for it was known that the king was in love; and they suspected
he was going to compose some verses by moonlight; and, although there
was no moon that evening, the king might, nevertheless, have some verses
to compose. Every one, therefore, took his leave; and, immediately
afterwards, the king turned towards Malicorne, who respectfully waited
until his majesty should address him. â€œWhat were you saying, just now,
NA
NA
if in search of words which had flown away.
NA
â€œOh, yes, sire, I remember; but I spoke to M. Manicamp, and I should not
NA
NA
â€œBecause I should not have liked to get the gardener into a scrape who
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Malicorne turned back, and led the king up to the ladder, saying, â€œThis
NA
NA
When Malicorne had brought the ladder on to the gravel walk, the king
NA
NA
NA
â€œNineteen feet--that is rather long; I hardly believe it can be so long
NA
â€œYou cannot judge very correctly with the ladder in that position, sire.
If it were upright, against a tree or a wall, for instance, you would
be better able to judge, because the comparison would assist you a good
NA
â€œOh! it does not matter, M. Malicorne; but I can hardly believe that the

The king shook his head. â€œThere is one unanswerable means of verifying
NA
NA
â€œEvery one knows, sire, that the ground-floor of the palace is eighteen
NA
NA
â€œWell, sire, if I place the ladder against the wall, we shall be able to
NA
NA
Malicorne took up the ladder, like a feather, and placed it upright
against the wall. And, in order to try the experiment, he chose, or
chance, perhaps, directed him to choose, the very window of the cabinet
where La Valliere was. The ladder just reached the edge of the cornice,
that is to say, the sill of the window; so that, by standing upon the
last round but one of the ladder, a man of about the middle height, as
the king was, for instance, could easily talk with those who might be
in the room. Hardly had the ladder been properly placed, when the king,
dropping the assumed part he had been playing in the comedy, began to
ascend the rounds of the ladder, which Malicorne held at the bottom. But
hardly had he completed half the distance when a patrol of Swiss guards
appeared in the garden, and advanced straight towards them. The king
descended with the utmost precipitation, and concealed himself among
the trees. Malicorne at once perceived that he must offer himself as
a sacrifice; for if he, too, were to conceal himself, the guard would
search everywhere until they had found either himself or the king,
perhaps both. It would be far better, therefore, that he alone should be
discovered. And, consequently, Malicorne hid himself so clumsily that
he was the only one arrested. As soon as he was arrested, Malicorne
was taken to the guard-house, and there he declared who he was, and was
immediately recognized. In the meantime, by concealing himself first
behind one clump of trees and then behind another, the king reached
the side door of his apartment, very much humiliated, and still more
disappointed. More than that, the noise made in arresting Malicorne had
drawn La Valliere and Montalais to their window; and even Madame herself
had appeared at her own, with a pair of wax candles, one in each hand,
clamorously asking what was the matter.
In the meantime, Malicorne sent for Dâ€™Artagnan, who did not lose a
moment in hurrying to him. But it was in vain he attempted to make him
understand his reasons, and in vain also that Dâ€™Artagnan did understand
them; and, further, it was equally in vain that both their sharp and
intuitive minds endeavored to give another turn to the adventure; there
was no other resource left for Malicorne but to let it be supposed
that he had wished to enter Mademoiselle de Montalaisâ€™s apartment,
as Saint-Aignan had passed for having wished to force Mademoiselle
de Tonnay-Charenteâ€™s door. Madame was inflexible; in the first place,
because, if Malicorne had, in fact, wished to enter her apartment at
night through the window, and by means of the ladder, in order to see
Montalais, it was a punishable offense on Malicorneâ€™s part, and he must
be punished accordingly; and, in the second place, if Malicorne, instead
of acting in his own name, had acted as an intermediary between La
Valliere and a person whose name it was superfluous to mention, his
crime was in that case even greater, since love, which is an excuse for
everything, did not exist in the case as an excuse. Madame therefore
made the greatest possible disturbance about the matter, and obtained
his dismissal from Monsieurâ€™s household, without reflecting, poor blind
creature, that both Malicorne and Montalais held her fast in their
clutches in consequence of her visit to De Guiche, and in a variety
of other ways equally delicate. Montalais, who was perfectly furious,
wished to revenge herself immediately, but Malicorne pointed out to her
that the kingâ€™s countenance would repay them for all the disgraces
in the world, and that it was a great thing to have to suffer on his
majestyâ€™s account.
Malicorne was perfectly right, and, therefore, although Montalais had
the spirit of ten women in her, he succeeded in bringing her round to
his own opinion. And we must not omit to state that the king helped them
to console themselves, for, in the first place, he presented Malicorne
with fifty thousand francs as a compensation for the post he had lost,
and, in the next place, he gave him an appointment in his own household,
delighted to have an opportunity of revenging himself in such a manner
upon Madame for all she had made him and La Valliere suffer. But as
Malicorne could no longer carry significant handkerchiefs for him or
plant convenient ladders, the royal lover was in a terrible state. There
seemed to be no hope, therefore, of ever getting near La Valliere again,
so long as she should remain at the Palais Royal. All the dignities and
all the money in the world could not remedy that. Fortunately, however,
Malicorne was on the lookout, and this so successfully that he met
Montalais, who, to do her justice, it must be admitted, was doing her
best to meet Malicorne. â€œWhat do you do during the night in Madameâ€™s
NA
NA
â€œBut it is very wrong to sleep; it can hardly be possible that, with the

NA
NA
â€œOf course not, since you have received fifty thousand francs and an

â€œThat is a matter of no moment; you are exceedingly afflicted at not
seeing me as you used to see me formerly, and more than all, you are
in despair at my having lost Madameâ€™s confidence; come now, is not that
NA
NA
â€œVery good; your distress of mind prevents you sleeping at night, and so
you sob, and sigh, and blow your nose ten times every minute as loud as
NA
â€œBut, my dear Malicorne, Madame cannot endure the slightest noise near

â€œI know that perfectly well; of course she canâ€™t endure anything; and
so, I tell you, when she hears your deep distress, she will turn you out

NA
NA
NA
â€œThe next thing that will happen will be, that La Valliere, finding
herself alone without you, will groan and utter such loud lamentations,

NA

â€œNot at all; whenever and whatever the room may be, it will always be

NA

And they separated.
Chapter XXXIII. Which Treats of Carpentry Operations, and Furnishes
Details upon the Mode of Constructing Staircases.
The advice which had been given to Montalais was communicated by her
to La Valliere, who could not but acknowledge that it was by no means
deficient in judgment, and who, after a certain amount of resistance,
rising rather from timidity than indifference to the project, resolved
to put it into execution. This story of the two girls weeping, and
filling Madameâ€™s bedroom with the noisiest lamentations, was Malicorneâ€™s
_chef-dâ€™oeuvre_. As nothing is so probable as improbability, so natural
as romance, this kind of Arabian Nights story succeeded perfectly with
Madame. The first thing she did was to send Montalais away, and then,
three days, or rather three nights afterwards, she had La Valliere
removed. She gave the latter one of the small rooms on the top story,
situated immediately over the apartments allotted to the gentlemen
of Monsieurâ€™s suite. One story only, that is to say, a mere flooring
separated the maids of honor from the officers and gentlemen of her
husbandâ€™s household. A private staircase, which was placed under Madame
de Navaillesâ€™s surveillance, was the only means of communication. For
greater safety, Madame de Navailles, who had heard of his majestyâ€™s
previous attempts, had the windows of the rooms and the openings of the
chimneys carefully barred. There was, therefore, every possible security
provided for Mademoiselle de la Valliere, whose room now bore more
resemblance to a cage than to anything else. When Mademoiselle de la
Valliere was in her own room, and she was there very frequently, for
Madame scarcely ever had any occasion for her services, since she once
knew she was safe under Madame de Navaillesâ€™s inspection, Mademoiselle
de la Valliere had no better means of amusing herself than looking
through the bars of her windows. It happened, therefore, that one
morning, as she was looking out as usual, she perceived Malicorne at one
of the windows exactly opposite to her own. He held a carpenterâ€™s rule
in his hand, was surveying the buildings, and seemed to be adding up
some figures on paper. La Valliere recognized Malicorne and nodded to
him; Malicorne, in his turn, replied by a formal bow, and disappeared
from the window. She was surprised at this marked coolness, so different
from his usual unfailing good-humor, but she remembered that he had lost
his appointment on her account, and that he could hardly be very amiably
disposed towards her, since, in all probability, she would never be in
a position to make him any recompense for what he had lost. She knew how
to forgive offenses, and with still more readiness could she sympathize
with misfortune. La Valliere would have asked Montalais her opinion, if
she had been within hearing, but she was absent, it being the hour
she commonly devoted to her own correspondence. Suddenly La Valliere
observed something thrown from the window where Malicorne had been
standing, pass across the open space which separated the iron bars, and
roll upon the floor. She advanced with no little curiosity towards this
object, and picked it up; it was a wooden reel for silk, only, in this
instance, instead of silk, a piece of paper was rolled round it. La
Valliere unrolled it and read as follows:
â€œMADEMOISELLE,--I am exceedingly anxious to learn two things: the first
is, to know if the flooring of your apartment is wood or brick; the
second, to ascertain at what distance your bed is placed from the
window. Forgive my importunity, and will you be good enough to send me
an answer by the same way you receive this letter--that is to say, by
means of the silk winder; only, instead of throwing into my room, as
I have thrown it into yours, which will be too difficult for you
to attempt, have the goodness merely to let it fall. Believe me,
mademoiselle, your most humble, most respectful servant,
â€œMALICORNE.
NA
NA
NA
but a faint glimpse, in consequence of the darkness of the room--a look
full of compassionate consideration. Malicorne understood her, and shook
his head, as if he meant to say, â€œNo, no, I am not out of my mind; be
NA
She smiled, as if still in doubt.
NA
to his head, then, after moving his hand like a man who writes very
rapidly, he put his hands together as if entreating her to write.
La Valliere, even if he were mad, saw no impropriety in doing what
NA
NA
having done this, she looked out again at Malicorne, who bowed to her,
signifying that he was about to descend. La Valliere understood that
it was to pick up the silk winder. She approached the window, and, in
accordance with Malicorneâ€™s instructions, let it fall. The winder was
still rolling along the flag-stones as Malicorne started after it,
overtook and picked it up, and beginning to peel it as a monkey would
do with a nut, he ran straight towards M. de Saint-Aignanâ€™s apartment.
Saint-Aignan had chosen, or rather solicited, that his rooms might be
as near the king as possible, as certain plants seek the sunâ€™s rays in
order to develop themselves more luxuriantly. His apartment consisted of
two rooms, in that portion of the palace occupied by Louis XIV. himself.
M. de Saint-Aignan was very proud of this proximity, which afforded
easy access to his majesty, and, more than that, the favor of occasional
unexpected meetings. At the moment we are now referring to, he
was engaged in having both his rooms magnificently carpeted, with
expectation of receiving the honor of frequent visits from the king; for
his majesty, since his passion for La Valliere, had chosen Saint-Aignan
as his confidant, and could not, in fact, do without him, either night
or day. Malicorne introduced himself to the comte, and met with no
difficulties, because he had been favorably noticed by the king; and
also, because the credit which one man may happen to enjoy is always a
bait for others. Saint-Aignan asked his visitor if he brought any news
with him.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œPrecisely so; but Madame got tired of her proximity, and has installed
NA
NA
the floor above him with his finger.
NA
NA
â€œBecause I am sure that your apartment _ought_, providentially, to be
NA
Saint-Aignan, at this remark, gave poor Malicorne a look, similar to one
of those La Valliere had already given a quarter of an hour before, that
is to say, he thought he had lost his senses.
NA
NA
NA
â€œMy reason is, that you have not clearly understood what I want to
NA
NA
â€œWell, then, you are aware that underneath the apartments set for
Madameâ€™s maids of honor, the gentlemen in attendance on the king and on
NA
â€œYes, I know that, since Manicamp, De Wardes, and others are living
NA
â€œPrecisely. Well, monsieur, admire the singularity of the circumstance;
the two rooms destined for M. de Guiche are exactly the very two
rooms situated underneath those which Mademoiselle de Montalais and
NA
NA
â€œâ€˜What then,â€™ do you say? Why, these two rooms are empty, since M. de
NA
NA
â€œWell! if I had the happiness to call myself Saint-Aignan, I should
NA
NA
â€œI should at once change the rooms I am occupying here, for those which
NA

abandon the chief post of honor, the proximity to the king, a privilege
conceded only to princes of the blood, to dukes, and peers! Permit me
to tell you, my dear Monsieur de Malicorne, that you must be out of your

My name is Malicorne, simply; and I am in perfect possession of all my

â€œYou know that Madame looks after La Valliere as carefully as Argus did

of speaking to the prisoner, and that neither you nor myself have yet

â€œYou certainly ought to know something about the subject, my poor

certainly shall not give them up; M. de Roquelaure, for instance, M. de

offer to one of those gentlemen the plan I have just shown you, together

you can ask me if the king would go to an apartment which would bring

NA
â€œWell! all you would have to do would be to get hold of a journeyman
carpenter, lock him up in your apartments, without letting him know
where you have taken him to, and let him make a hole in your ceiling,
NA
NA
NA
â€œNothing, except that you have hit upon a singular, bold idea,
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhy, effecting such an opening as that will make a terrible noise: it

â€œOh! monsieur le comte, I am quite sure that the carpenter I shall
select will not make the slightest noise in the world. He will saw an
opening three feet square, with a saw covered with tow, and no one, not

NA

which you will have cut through, you will put up a staircase, which will
either allow Mademoiselle de la Valliere to descend into your room, or
NA
NA
â€œNo; for in your room it will be hidden by a partition, over which
you will throw a tapestry similar to that which covers the rest of the
apartment; and in Mademoiselle de la Valliereâ€™s room it will not be
seen, for the trapdoor, which will be a part of the flooring itself,
NA
NA
delight.
â€œAnd now, monsieur le comte, there is no occasion to make you admit
that the king will frequently come to the room where such a staircase is
constructed. I think that M. Dangeau, particularly, will be struck by my

friend; an opportunity, dear M. Malicorne, for which I am indebted to

Chapter XXXIV. The Promenade by Torchlight.
Saint-Aignan, delighted with what he had just heard, and rejoiced at
what the future foreshadowed for him, bent his steps towards De Guicheâ€™s
two rooms. He who, a quarter of an hour previously, would hardly
yield up his own rooms for a million francs, was now ready to expend
a million, if it were necessary, upon the acquisition of the two happy
rooms he coveted so eagerly. But he did not meet with so many obstacles.
M. de Guiche did not yet know where he was to lodge, and, besides,
was still too far ill to trouble himself about his lodgings; and so
Saint-Aignan obtained De Guicheâ€™s two rooms without difficulty. As for
M. Dangeau, he was so immeasurably delighted, that he did not even give
himself the trouble to think whether Saint-Aignan had any particular
reason for removing. Within an hour after Saint-Aignanâ€™s new resolution,
he was in possession of the two rooms; and ten minutes later Malicorne
entered, followed by the upholsterers. During this time, the king asked
for Saint-Aignan; the valet ran to his late apartments and found M.
Dangeau there; Dangeau sent him on to De Guicheâ€™s, and Saint-Aignan was
found there; but a little delay had of course taken place, and the king
had already exhibited once or twice evident signs of impatience, when
Saint-Aignan entered his royal masterâ€™s presence, quite out of breath.

of lamentation to that with which Caesar, eighteen hundred years
previously, had pronounced the _Et tu quoque_.
â€œSire, I am far from abandoning you, for, on the contrary, I am busily

NA
â€œYes, sire. But I donâ€™t find myself comfortable where I am, so I am

king. â€œOh! this exceeds all endurance. But so it is: there was only
one woman for whom my heart cared at all, and all my family is leagued
together to tear her from me; and my friend, to whom I confided my
distress, and who helped me to bear up under it, has become wearied
of my complaints and is going to leave me without even asking my

Saint-Aignan began to laugh. The king at once guessed there must be some
NA
hope.
â€œThis, sire, that the friend whom the king calumniates is going to try
NA
NA
NA
â€œHow--how?--tell me that, Saint-Aignan. I wish to know what your project
NA
NA
I must set about attaining success; but I have every reason to believe
NA
â€œTo-morrow, do you say! What happiness! But why are you changing your

NA
â€œDo you happen to know where the two rooms destined for De Guiche are
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhat! is it possible that you do not understand, sire, that above
De Guicheâ€™s lodgings are two rooms, one of which is Mademoiselle
NA
â€œLa Valliereâ€™s, is it not so, Saint-Aignan? Oh! yes, yes. It is a
brilliant idea, Saint-Aignan, a true friendâ€™s idea, a poetâ€™s idea. By
bringing me nearer her from whom the world seems to unite to separate
me--you are far more than Pylades was for Orestes, or Patroclus for
NA
NA
were to know my projects in their full extent, you would continue to
pronounce such a pompous eulogium upon me. Ah! sire, I know how very
different are the epithets which certain Puritans of the court will
not fail to apply to me when they learn of what I intend to do for your
NA
â€œSaint-Aignan, I am dying with impatience; I am in a perfect fever; I
shall never be able to wait until to-morrow--to-morrow! why, to-morrow
NA
â€œAnd yet, sire, I shall require you, if you please, to go out presently
NA
â€œWith you--agreed; we will talk about your projects, we will talk of

NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œ_Must?_--no, no--a thousand times no! I will never again expose
myself to the horrible torture of being close to her, of seeing her, of
touching her dress as I pass by her, and yet not be able to say a
word to her. No, I renounce a torture which you suppose will bring me
happiness, but which consumes and eats away my very life; to see her in
the presence of strangers, and not to tell her that I love her, when my
whole being reveals my affection and betrays me to every one; no! I have

the circumstances I do give you directions, sire; and either a hunting

â€œThose who say so, sire, are as insolent as they would like to be

to listen to them, I have nothing further to say. In such a case,

to Saint-Germain: I will breakfast there to-morrow, and will return to

NA
â€œIt is because I have nothing more to tell you. Industry counts for
something in this world, sire; but still, chance plays so important
a part in it that I have been accustomed to leave her the sidewalk,
NA
NA
NA
Comforted in this manner, the king went immediately to Madame, to whom
he announced the intended expedition. Madame fancied at the first moment
that she saw in this unexpectedly arranged party a plot of the kingâ€™s
to converse with La Valliere, either on the road under cover of the
darkness, or in some other way, but she took especial care not to show
any of her fancies to her brother-in-law, and accepted the invitation
with a smile upon her lips. She gave directions aloud that her maids of
honor should accompany her, secretly intending in the evening to take
the most effectual steps to interfere with his majestyâ€™s attachment.
Then, when she was alone, and at the very moment the poor lover, who
had issued orders for the departure, was reveling in the idea that
Mademoiselle de la Valliere would form one of the party,--luxuriating in
the sad happiness persecuted lovers enjoy of realizing through the
sense of sight alone all the transports of possession,--Madame, who
was surrounded by her maids of honor, was saying:--â€œTwo ladies will
be enough for me this evening, Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente and

La Valliere had anticipated her own omission, and was prepared for it:
but persecution had rendered her courageous, and she did not give Madame
the pleasure of seeing on her face the impression of the shock her heart
received. On the contrary, smiling with that ineffable gentleness which
gave an angelic expression to her features--â€œIn that case, Madame, I

NA
â€œI shall be able to employ it, then, in progressing with that piece of
tapestry which your highness has been good enough to notice, and which I

And having made a respectful obeisance she withdrew to her own
apartment; Mesdemoiselles de Tonnay-Charente and de Montalais did the
same. The rumor of the intended promenade soon spread all over the
palace; ten minutes afterwards Malicorne learned Madameâ€™s resolution,
and slipped under Montalaisâ€™s door a note, in the following terms:
NA
Montalais, in pursuance of the compact she had entered into, began by
burning the letter, and then sat down to reflect. Montalais was a girl
full of expedients, and so she very soon arranged her plan. Towards five
oâ€™clock, which was the hour for her to repair to Madameâ€™s apartment, she
was running across the courtyard, and had reached within a dozen paces
of a group of officers, when she uttered a cry, fell gracefully on
one knee, rose again, with difficulty, and walked on limpingly. The
gentlemen ran forward to her assistance; Montalais had sprained her
foot. Faithful to the discharge of her duty, she insisted, however,
notwithstanding her accident, upon going to Madameâ€™s apartments.
NA
NA
Montalais related how it had happened, that in hurrying on, in order to
arrive as quickly as possible, she had sprained her foot. Madame seemed
to pity her, and wished to have a surgeon sent for immediately, but
she, assuring her that there was nothing really serious in the accident,

on you, and I should have begged Mademoiselle de la Valliere to take my

like a bird. Besides, your highness knows how much she detests going out,

Madame was reflecting that the king could very easily leave
Saint-Germain during the night, and that, as it was only four leagues
and a half from Paris to Saint-Germain, he might readily be in Paris

NA
â€œOh! she does not yet know of my accident; but even did she know of it,
I most certainly should not ask her to do anything that might interfere
with her own plans. I think she wishes this evening to realize quietly
by herself that amusement of the late king, when he said to M. de
Cinq-Mars, â€˜Let us amuse ourselves by doing nothing, and making

Madame felt convinced that some mysterious love adventure lurked behind
this strong desire for solitude. The secret _might_ be Louisâ€™s return
during the night; it could not be doubted any longer La Valliere had
been informed of his intended return, and that was the reason for her
delight at having to remain behind at the Palais Royal. It was a plan
settled and arranged beforehand.

road; she shall sleep near me during the night, and his majesty must
be very clever if he can exchange a single word with Mademoiselle de la
NA
La Valliere received the order to set off with the same indifferent
gentleness with which she had received the order to play Cinderella.
But, inwardly, her delight was extreme, and she looked upon this change
in the princessâ€™s resolution as a consolation which Providence had sent
her. With less penetration than Madame possessed, she attributed all
to chance. While every one, with the exception of those in disgrace,
of those who were ill, and those who were suffering from sprains, were
being driven towards Saint-Germain, Malicorne smuggled his workman into
the palace in one of M. de Saint-Aignanâ€™s carriages, and led him into
the room corresponding to La Valliereâ€™s. The man set to work with a
will, tempted by the splendid reward which had been promised him. As the
very best tools and implements had been selected from the reserve stock
belonging to the engineers attached to the kingâ€™s household--and among
others, a saw with teeth so sharp and well tempered that it was able,
under water even, to cut through oaken joists as hard as iron--the work
in question advanced very rapidly, and a square portion of the ceiling,
taken from between two of the joists, fell into the arms of the
delighted Saint-Aignan, Malicorne, the workman, and a confidential
valet, the latter being one brought into the world to see and hear
everything, but to repeat nothing. In accordance with a new plan
indicated by Malicorne, the opening was effected in an angle of the
room--and for this reason. As there was no dressing-closet adjoining La
Valliereâ€™s room, she had solicited, and had that very morning obtained,
a large screen intended to serve as a partition. The screen that had
been allotted her was perfectly sufficient to conceal the opening, which
would, besides, be hidden by all the artifices skilled cabinet-makers
would have at their command. The opening having been made, the workman
glided between the joists, and found himself in La Valliereâ€™s room. When
there, he cut a square opening in the flooring, and out of the boards he
manufactured a trap so accurately fitting into the opening that the most
practised eye could hardly detect the necessary interstices made by its
lines of juncture with the floor. Malicorne had provided for everything:
a ring and a couple of hinges which had been bought for the purpose,
were affixed to the trap-door; and a small circular stair-case, packed
in sections, had been bought ready made by the industrious Malicorne,
who had paid two thousand francs for it. It was higher than what was
required, but the carpenter reduced the number of steps, and it
was found to suit exactly. This staircase, destined to receive so
illustrious a burden, was merely fastened to the wall by a couple of
iron clamps, and its base was fixed into the floor of the comteâ€™s room
by two iron pegs screwed down tightly, so that the king, and all his
cabinet councilors too, might pass up and down the staircase without any
fear. Every blow of the hammer fell upon a thick pad or cushion, and
the saw was not used until the handle had been wrapped in wool, and the
blade steeped in oil. The noisiest part of the work, moreover, had taken
place during the night and early in the morning, that is to say, when
La Valliere and Madame were both absent. When, about two oâ€™clock in the
afternoon, the court returned to the Palais Royal, La Valliere went up
into her own room. Everything was in its proper place--not the smallest
particle of sawdust, not the smallest chip, was left to bear witness to
the violation of her domicile. Saint-Aignan, however, wishing to do his
utmost in forwarding the work, had torn his fingers and his shirt
too, and had expended no ordinary amount of perspiration in the kingâ€™s
service. The palms of his hands were covered with blisters, occasioned
by his having held the ladder for Malicorne. He had, moreover, brought
up, one by one, the seven pieces of the staircase, each consisting of
two steps. In fact, we can safely assert that, if the king had seen him
so ardently at work, his majesty would have sworn an eternal gratitude
towards his faithful attendant. As Malicorne anticipated, the workman
had completely finished the job in twenty-four hours; he received
twenty-four louis, and left, overwhelmed with delight, for he had gained
in one day as much as six monthsâ€™ hard work would have procured him.
No one had the slightest suspicion of what had taken place in the room
under Mademoiselle de la Valliereâ€™s apartment. But in the evening of the
second day, at the very moment La Valliere had just left Madameâ€™s circle
and returned to her own room, she heard a slight creaking sound in one
corner. Astonished, she looked to see whence it proceeded, and the noise
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
appearing like a ghost at the end of the room.
La Valliere uttered a loud cry, and fell trembling into an armchair, as
the king advanced respectfully towards her.
Chapter XXXV. The Apparition.
La Valliere very soon recovered from her surprise, for, owing to his
respectful bearing, the king inspired her with more confidence by his
presence than his sudden appearance had deprived her of. But, as he
noticed that which made La Valliere most uneasy was the means by which
he had effected an entrance into her room, he explained to her the
system of the staircase concealed by the screen, and strongly disavowed
the notion of his being a supernatural appearance.

smile, â€œpresent or absent, you do not appear to my mind more at one time

NA
â€œOh, what you know so well, sire; that there is not one moment in which
the poor girl whose secret you surprised at Fontainebleau, and whom
you came to snatch from the foot of the cross itself, does not think of
NA
NA
La Valliere smiled mournfully, and continued: â€œBut, sire, have you
reflected that your ingenious invention could not be of the slightest
NA
NA
â€œBecause this room may be subject to being searched at any moment of
the day. Madame herself may, at any time, come here accidentally; my
companions run in at any moment they please. To fasten the door on the
inside, is to denounce myself as plainly as if I had written above, â€˜No
admittance,--the king is within!â€™ Even now, sire, at this very moment,
there is nothing to prevent the door opening, and your majesty being
NA
NA
a phantom, for no one can tell in what way I came here. Besides, it is

â€œOh, sire, reflect for a moment how terrible the scandal would be!

â€œAnd your conclusion from all this, my dear Louise,--come, explain

would result from your being found here would be far greater than our

She looked at the king, who held out his hand to her, which she took and
gently pressed between her own.
NA
NA
â€œStay, sire; at this very moment, even while you are speaking about it,

â€œBut you would not be found out, Louise, if you were to descend the

â€œYou do not quite understand me, Louise, since you get offended at

delight.

anxiously I am trying to find or invent a means of removing all

NA

clear, piercing gaze which penetrates the very heart, and said softly to
herself, â€œAlas! alas! it is not you of whom I am afraid,--it is not you

caressing La Valliereâ€™s hand between his own.
At this moment the sound of steps was heard in the corridor.
NA
NA
The king made but one bound from the chair where he was sitting to his
hiding-place behind the screen. He had barely time; for as he drew
one of the folds before him, the handle of the door was turned, and
Montalais appeared at the threshold. As a matter of course she entered
quite naturally, and without any ceremony, for she knew perfectly
well that to knock at the door beforehand would be showing a suspicion
towards La Valliere which would be displeasing to her. She accordingly
entered, and after a rapid glance round the room, in the brief course of
which she observed two chairs very close to each other, she was so long
in shutting the door, which seemed to be difficult to close, one can
hardly tell how or why, that the king had ample time to raise the
trap-door, and to descend again to Saint-Aignanâ€™s room.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œIs there any occasion for us to enter into explanations, and do you not
understand what I mean? Come, you must have noticed the fluctuations in
Madameâ€™s humor during several days past; you must have noticed how she
first kept you close beside her, then dismissed you, and then sent for

â€œWell, then, this is how the matter stands: Madame, who can no longer
rely upon any further assistance in France; for she has, one after the
other, made use of the two queens, of Monsieur, and the whole court,
too, now bethinks herself of a certain person who has certain pretended

La Valliere became as white as a marble statue.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, this evening a letter has been dispatched by Madame to Saint

Court, which I believe is one of the royal residences, situated about a

NA
â€œWell; as Madame writes regularly to London once a fortnight, and as the
ordinary courier left for London not more than three days ago, I have
been thinking that some serious circumstance alone could have induced
her to write again so soon, for you know she is a very indolent
NA
NA
â€œThis letter has been written, therefore, something tells me so, at

NA
â€œAnd I, who saw the letter lying on Madameâ€™s desk before she sealed it,

NA
NA
NA
NA
La Valliere rose hurriedly from her chair, a prey to the most painful
NA
smiling dreams of youth and innocence have fled already. I have nothing
now to conceal, either from you or any one else. My life is exposed to
every oneâ€™s inspection, and can be opened like a book, in which all
the world can read, from the king himself to the first passer-by. Aure,
NA
Montalais approached close to her, and said, â€œConsult your own heart, of
NA
â€œWell; I do not love M. de Bragelonne; when I say I do not love him,
understand that I love him as the most affectionate sister could love
the best of brothers, but that is not what he requires, nor what I
NA
NA
NA
NA
paid dearly enough for pronouncing those words. And now, Montalais, tell
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œVery good; and so all you have to ask me is my advice respecting M.
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo, it is nothing of the kind. Ought I to marry him in order to keep

NA
Montalais, smiling; â€œyou ask me if you ought to marry Raoul, whose
friend I am, and whom I shall mortally offend in giving my opinion
against him; and then, you ask me if you should cease to listen to the
king, whose subject I am, and whom I should offend if I were to advise
you in a particular way. Ah, Louise, you seem to hold a difficult
NA
NA
slightly mocking tone of her companion; â€œif I were to marry M. de
Bragelonne, I should be far from bestowing on him the happiness he
deserves; but, for the same reason, if I listen to the king he would
become the possessor of one indifferent in very many aspects, I admit,
but one whom his affection confers an appearance of value. What I ask
you, then, is to tell me some means of disengaging myself honorably
either from the one or from the other; or rather, I ask you, from which
NA
NA
seven wise men of Greece, and I have no perfectly invariable rules
of conduct to govern me; but, on the other hand, I have a little
experience, and I can assure you that no woman ever asks for advice of
the nature which you have just asked me, without being in a terrible
state of embarrassment. Besides, you have made a solemn promise, which
every principle of honor requires you to fulfil; if, therefore, you are
embarrassed, in consequence of having undertaken such an engagement, it
is not a strangerâ€™s advice (every one is a stranger to a heart full of
love), it is not my advice, I repeat, that can extricate you from your
embarrassment. I shall not give it you, therefore; and for a greater
reason still--because, were I in your place, I should feel much more
embarrassed after the advice than before it. All I can do is, to repeat
NA
NA
â€œVery well; that is all. Tell me in what way you wish me to help
you; tell me for and against whom,--in this way we shall not make any

â€œA greater reason for being of service to you; if I were not to know
what is going on in that direction I should not be of any service
at all, and consequently you would not obtain any advantage from my
acquaintance. Friendships live and thrive upon a system of reciprocal

â€œThe result is, then, that you will remain at the same time Madameâ€™s

frankness appeared to her an offense both to the woman and the friend.

looking at Montalais with her eyes wide open.
â€œWhy, the fact is, that since we have belonged to the court, my dear

La Valliere hung down her head, and began to weep. Montalais looked

her apartment, where Malicorne was waiting for her.
Chapter XXXVI. The Portrait.
In that malady which is termed love the paroxysms succeed each other
at intervals, ever accelerating from the moment the disease declares
itself. By and by, the paroxysms are less frequent, in proportion as
the cure approaches. This being laid down as a general axiom, and as the
leading article of a particular chapter, we will now proceed with
our recital. The next day, the day fixed by the king for the first
conversation in Saint-Aignanâ€™s room, La Valliere, on opening one of
the folds of the screen, found upon the floor a letter in the kingâ€™s
handwriting. The letter had been passed, through a slit in the floor,
from the lower apartment to her own. No indiscreet hand or curious gaze
could have brought or did bring this single paper. This, too, was one of
Malicorneâ€™s ideas. Having seen how very serviceable Saint-Aignan would
become to the king on account of his apartment, he did not wish that the
courtier should become still more indispensable as a messenger, and so
he had, on his own private account, reserved this last post for himself.
La Valliere most eagerly read the letter, which fixed two oâ€™clock
that same afternoon for the rendezvous, and which indicated the way of
raising the trap-door which was constructed out of the flooring. â€œMake
NA
letter, words which astonished the young girl, but at the same time
reassured her.
The hours passed away very slowly, but the time fixed, however, arrived
at last. As punctual as the priestess Hero, Louise lifted up the
trap-door at the last stroke of the hour of two, and found the king on
the steps, waiting for her with the greatest respect, in order to
give her his hand to descend. The delicacy and deference shown in this
attention affected her very powerfully. At the foot of the staircase
the two lovers found the comte, who, with a smile and a low reverence
distinguished by the best taste, expressed his thanks to La Valliere
for the honor she conferred upon him. Then turning towards the king, he
said:
NA
uneasiness.
NA
of coming down here, it was from an interested motive. I have procured
a most admirable portrait painter, who is celebrated for the fidelity
of his likenesses, and I wish you to be kind enough to authorize him
to paint yours. Besides, if you positively wish it, the portrait shall

the king to her, â€œwe shall not be three as you wished, but four instead.
And, so long as we are not alone, there can be as many present as you
NA
NA
door to let his guests precede him. The king walked behind La Valliere,
and fixed his eyes lingeringly and passionately upon that neck as white
as snow, upon which her long fair ringlets fell in heavy masses. La
Valliere was dressed in a thick silk robe of pearl gray color, with a
tinge of rose, with jet ornaments, which displayed to greater effect
the dazzling purity of her skin, holding in her slender and transparent
hands a bouquet of heartsease, Bengal roses, and clematis, surrounded
with leaves of the tenderest green, above which uprose, like a tiny
goblet spilling magic influence a Haarlem tulip of gray and violet tints
of a pure and beautiful species, which had cost the gardener five yearsâ€™
toil of combinations, and the king five thousand francs. Louis had
placed this bouquet in La Valliereâ€™s hand as he saluted her. In the
room, the door of which Saint-Aignan had just opened, a young man was
standing, dressed in a purple velvet jacket, with beautiful black eyes
and long brown hair. It was the painter; his canvas was quite ready, and
his palette prepared for use.
He bowed to La Valliere with the grave curiosity of an artist who
is studying his model, saluted the king discreetly, as if he did not
recognize him, and as he would, consequently, have saluted any other
gentleman. Then, leading Mademoiselle de la Valliere to the seat he had
arranged for her, he begged her to sit down.
The young girl assumed an attitude graceful and unrestrained, her hands
occupied and her limbs reclining on cushions; and in order that her gaze
might not assume a vague or affected expression, the painter begged
her to choose some kind of occupation, so as to engage her attention;
whereupon Louis XIV., smiling, sat down on the cushions at La Valliereâ€™s
feet; so that she, in the reclining posture she had assumed, leaning
back in the armchair, holding her flowers in her hand, and he, with his
eyes raised towards her and fixed devouringly on her face--they, both
together, formed so charming a group, that the artist contemplated
painting it with professional delight, while on his side, Saint-Aignan
regarded them with feelings of envy. The painter sketched rapidly; and
very soon, beneath the earliest touches of the brush, there started into
life, out of the gray background, the gentle, poetry-breathing face,
with its soft calm eyes and delicately tinted cheeks, enframed in the
masses of hair which fell about her neck. The lovers, however, spoke
but little, and looked at each other a great deal; sometimes their eyes
became so languishing in their gaze, that the painter was obliged to
interrupt his work in order to avoid representing an Erycina instead
of La Valliere. It was on such occasions that Saint-Aignan came to the
rescue, and recited verses, or repeated one of those little tales such
as Patru related, and Tallemant des Reaux wrote so cleverly. Or, it
might be that La Valliere was fatigued, and the sitting was, therefore,
suspended for awhile; and, immediately, a tray of precious porcelain
laden with the most beautiful fruits which could be obtained, and rich
wines distilling their bright colors in silver goblets, beautifully
chased, served as accessories to the picture of which the painter could
but retrace the most ephemeral resemblance.
Louis was intoxicated with love, La Valliere with happiness,
Saint-Aignan with ambition, and the painter was storing up recollections
for his old age. Two hours passed away in this manner, and four oâ€™clock
having struck, La Valliere rose, and made a sign to the king. Louis also
rose, approached the picture, and addressed a few flattering remarks
to the painter. Saint-Aignan also praised the picture, which, as he
pretended, was already beginning to assume an accurate resemblance. La
Valliere in her turn, blushingly thanked the painter and passed into the
next room, where the king followed her, after having previously summoned
Saint-Aignan.
NA
â€œOh! sire, pray think that some one will be sure to come to my room, and
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œOn that day, sire, I shall be quite out of my mind, and you must not
NA
NA
La Valliere sighed, but, without the courage to oppose her royal loverâ€™s
NA
with these words she ran lightly up the stairs, and disappeared from her
loverâ€™s gaze.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo; but my love for her is an unquenchable thirst; in vain do I drink,
in vain do I swallow the drops of water which your industry procures for
NA
â€œSire, that is in some degree your own fault, and your majesty alone has
NA
NA
â€œIn that case, therefore, the means to be happy, is to fancy yourself
NA
NA
â€œThere, there, sire--do not despair: I have already been at work on your
NA
in a despairing manner.
NA
â€œOh! yes, indeed, yes, my dear Saint-Aignan; but invent, for Heavenâ€™s
NA
NA
The king wished to see the portrait again, as he was unable to see the
original. He pointed out several alterations to the painter and left the
room, and then Saint-Aignan dismissed the artist. The easel, paints, and
painter himself, had scarcely gone, when Malicorne showed his head in
the doorway. He was received by Saint-Aignan with open arms, but still
with a little sadness, for the cloud which had passed across the royal
sun, veiled, in its turn, the faithful satellite, and Malicorne at a
glance perceived the melancholy that brooded on Saint-Aignanâ€™s face.
NA
â€œAnd good reason too, my dear Monsieur Malicorne. Will you believe that
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œOh! he has not even thought of that. No, indeed, it seems that what has
NA
â€œI will tell you, monsieur le comte,--he is dissatisfied at finding
himself the fourth person at a rendezvous of this kind. How is it
NA
â€œWhy, how is it likely I could have done so, dear M. Malicorne, when I
NA
NA
NA
â€œAnd also required that the painter, whom I met downstairs just now,
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhat! dissatisfied that I have so punctually and so literally obeyed
NA
Malicorne began to scratch his ear, as he asked, â€œWhat time did the king
NA
NA
NA
â€œEver since half-past one; it would have been a fine thing, indeed, to
NA
Malicorne, notwithstanding his respect for Saint-Aignan, could not help
NA
NA
â€œNo; but I had him waiting here from midday. Far better, you know, for
a painter to be kept waiting a couple of hours than the king a single

NA
NA
â€œWell, then, monsieur le comte, if you wish the king to be a little more
NA
â€œâ€˜_Ventre saint-gris!_â€™ as his grandfather used to say; of course I wish
NA
â€œWell, all you have to do is, when the king comes to-morrow, to be
obliged to go away on a most pressing matter of business, which cannot

alarm.

Malicorne, moving towards the door.
â€œNay, nay, dear Monsieur Malicorne; on the contrary, go on--I begin to

Saint-Aignan, as if compelled by his conviction to admit it.
Chapter XXXVII. Hampton Court.
The revelation we have witnessed, that Montalais made to La Valliere,
in a preceding chapter, very naturally makes us return to the principal
hero of this tale, a poor wandering knight, roving about at the kingâ€™s
caprice. If our readers will be good enough to follow us, we will, in
his company, cross that strait, more stormy than the Euripus, which
separates Calais from Dover; we will speed across that green and fertile
country, with its numerous little streams; through Maidstone, and many
other villages and towns, each prettier than the other; and, finally,
arrive at London. From thence, like bloodhounds following a track, after
having ascertained that Raoul had made his first stay at Whitehall,
his second at St. Jamesâ€™s, and having learned that he had been warmly
received by Monk, and introduced to the best society of Charles II.â€™s
court, we will follow him to one of Charles II.â€™s summer residences near
the lively little village of Kingston, at Hampton Court, situated on the
Thames. The river is not, at that spot, the boastful highway which bears
upon its broad bosom its thousands of travelers; nor are its waters
black and troubled as those of Cocytus, as it boastfully asserts, â€œI,
NA
and murmuring stream, with moss-fringed banks, reflecting, in its broad
mirror, the willows and beeches which ornament its sides, and on which
may occasionally be seen a light bark indolently reclining among the
tall reeds, in a little creek formed of alders and forget-me-nots. The
surrounding country on all sides smiled in happiness and wealth; the
brick cottages from whose chimneys the blue smoke was slowly ascending
in wreaths, peeped forth from the belts of green holly which environed
them; children dressed in red frocks appeared and disappeared amidst
the high grass, like poppies bowed by the gentler breath of the passing
breeze. The sheep, ruminating with half-closed eyes, lay lazily about
under the shadow of the stunted aspens, while, far and near, the
kingfishers, plumed with emerald and gold, skimmed swiftly along the
surface of the water, like a magic ball heedlessly touching, as he
passed, the line of his brother angler, who sat watching in his boat
the fish as they rose to the surface of the sparkling stream. High above
this paradise of dark shadows and soft light, rose the palace of Hampton
Court, built by Wolsey--a residence the haughty cardinal had been
obliged, timid courtier that he was, to offer to his master, Henry
VIII., who had glowered with envy and cupidity at the magnificent
new home. Hampton Court, with its brick walls, its large windows, its
handsome iron gates, as well as its curious bell turrets, its retired
covered walks, and interior fountains, like those of the Alhambra, was
a perfect bower of roses, jasmine, and clematis. Every sense, sight and
smell particularly, was gratified, and the reception-rooms formed a very
charming framework for the pictures of love which Charles II. unrolled
among the voluptuous paintings of Titian, of Pordenone and of Van Dyck;
the same Charles whose fatherâ€™s portrait--the martyr king--was hanging
in his gallery, and who could show upon the wainscots of the various
apartments the holes made by the balls of the puritanical followers of
Cromwell, when on the 24th of August, 1648, at the time they had brought
Charles I. prisoner to Hampton Court. There it was that the king,
intoxicated with pleasure and adventure, held his court--he, who, a poet
in feeling, thought himself justified in redeeming, by a whole day of
voluptuousness, every minute which had been formerly passed in anguish
and misery. It was not the soft green sward of Hampton Court--so soft
that it almost resembled the richest velvet in the thickness of its
texture--nor was it the beds of flowers, with their variegated hues
which encircled the foot of every tree with rose-trees many feet in
height, embracing most lovingly their trunks--nor even the enormous
lime-trees, whose branches swept the earth like willows, offering a
ready concealment for love or reflection beneath the shade of their
foliage--it was none of these things for which Charles II. loved his
palace of Hampton Court. Perhaps it might have been that beautiful sheet
of water, which the cool breeze rippled like the wavy undulations of
Cleopatraâ€™s hair, waters bedecked with cresses and white water-lilies,
whose chaste bulbs coyly unfolding themselves beneath the sunâ€™s warm
rays, reveal the golden gems which lie concealed within their milky
petals--murmuring waters, on the bosom of which black swans majestically
floated, and the graceful water-fowl, with their tender broods covered
with silken down, darted restlessly in every direction, in pursuit
of the insects among the reeds, or the fogs in their mossy retreats.
Perhaps it might have been the enormous hollies, with their dark and
tender green foliage; or the bridges uniting the banks of the canals in
their embrace; or the fawns browsing in the endless avenues of the park;
or the innumerable birds that hopped about the gardens, or flew from
branch to branch, amidst the emerald foliage.
It might well have been any of these charms--for Hampton Court had them
all; and possessed, too, almost forests of white roses, which climbed
and trailed along the lofty trellises, showering down upon the ground
their snowy leaves rich with soft perfumery. But no, what Charles II.
most loved in Hampton Court were the charming figures who, when midday
was past, flitted to and fro along the broad terraces of the gardens;
like Louis XIV., he had their wealth of beauties painted for his gallery
by one of the great artists of the period--an artist who well knew the
secret of transferring to canvas the rays of light which escaped from
beaming eyes heavy laden with love and loveâ€™s delights.
The day of our arrival at Hampton Court is almost as clear and bright
as a summerâ€™s day in France; the atmosphere is heavy with the delicious
perfume of geraniums, sweet-peas, seringas, and heliotrope scattered in
profusion around. It is past midday, and the king, having dined after
his return from hunting, paid a visit to Lady Castlemaine, the lady who
was reputed at the time to hold his heart in bondage; and this proof
of his devotion discharged, he was readily permitted to pursue his
infidelities until evening arrived. Love and amusement ruled the entire
court; it was the period when ladies would seriously interrogate
their ruder companions as to their opinions upon a foot more or
less captivating, according to whether it wore a pink or lilac silk
stocking--for it was the period when Charles II. had declared that there
was no hope of safety for a woman who wore green silk stockings, because
Miss Lucy Stewart wore them of that color. While the king is endeavoring
in all directions to inculcate others with his preferences on this
point, we will ourselves bend our steps towards an avenue of beech-trees
opposite the terrace, and listen to the conversation of a young girl in
a dark-colored dress, who is walking with another of about her own age
dressed in blue. They crossed a beautiful lawn, from the center of which
sprang a fountain, with the figure of a siren executed in bronze, and
strolled on, talking as they went, towards the terrace, along which,
looking out upon the park and interspersed at frequent intervals, were
erected summer-houses, diverse in form and ornament; these summer-houses
were nearly all occupied; the two young women passed on, the one
blushing deeply, while the other seemed dreamily silent. At last, having
reached the end of the terrace which looks on the river, and finding
there a cool retreat, they sat down close to each other.
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, you; to the extremity of the palace, towards that seat yonder,
where the young Frenchman is seated, wasting his time in sighs and
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAbout how it happens that the Vicomte de Bragelonne always accompanies

NA
â€œWhy not?--he is a most agreeable and charming companion.--No one hears

NA
NA
â€œOh! _a propos_ of the duke, Mary, it seems he has shown you great
attention since his return from France; how is your own heart in that

Mary Grafton shrugged her shoulders with seeming indifference.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œNot yet, one word before you do: come, come, you who know so many of
NA
NA
â€œThat may be; but, seriously, although politics do not much concern us,
we know enough to be satisfied that M. de Bragelonne has no mission of

NA
I am going to betray a state secret. Shall I tell you the nature of the
letter which King Louis XIV. gave M. de Bragelonne for King Charles II.?
I will; these are the very words: â€˜My brother, the bearer of this is a
gentleman attached to my court, and the son of one whom you regard most
NA
NA
â€œWord for word--or something very like it. I will not answer for the
NA
â€œWell, and what conclusion do you, or rather what conclusion does the
NA
â€œThat the king of France has his own reasons for removing M. de
NA
NA
â€œKing Charles received M. de Bragelonne, as you are aware, in the
most distinguished and friendly manner; the handsomest apartments in
Whitehall were allotted to him; and as you are the most valuable
and precious person in his court, inasmuch as you have rejected his
heart,--nay, do not blush,--he wished you to take a fancy to this
Frenchman, and he was desirous to confer upon him so costly a prize.
And this is the reason why you, the heiress of three hundred thousand
pounds, a future duchess, so beautiful, so good, have been thrown in
Bragelonneâ€™s way, in all the promenades and parties of pleasure to which
NA
Mary Grafton smiled with that charming expression which was habitual to
NA
NA
Hardly had she pronounced these words, when the duke appeared from one
of the pavilions on the terrace, and, approaching the two girls, with
a smile, said, â€œYou are mistaken, Miss Lucy; I am not jealous; and the
proof, Miss Mary, is yonder, in the person of M. de Bragelonne himself,
who ought to be the cause of my jealousy, but who is dreaming in pensive
solitude. Poor fellow! Allow me to leave you for a few minutes, while I
avail myself of those few minutes to converse with Miss Lucy Stewart, to

you do me the honor to accept my hand, in order that I may lead you to

smiling, took Miss Stewartâ€™s hand, and led her away. When by herself,
Mary Grafton, her head gently inclined towards her shoulder, with that
indolent gracefulness of action which distinguishes young English girls,
remained for a moment with her eyes fixed on Raoul, but as if uncertain
what to do. At last, after first blushing violently, and then turning
deadly pale, thus revealing the internal combat which assailed her
heart, she seemed to make up her mind to adopt a decided course, and
with a tolerably firm step, advanced towards the seat on which Raoul
was reclining, buried in the profoundest meditation, as we have already
said. The sound of Miss Maryâ€™s steps, though they could hardly be heard
upon the green sward, awakened Raoul from his musing attitude; he
turned round, perceived the young girl, and walked forward to meet the
companion whom his happy destiny had thrown in his way.

â€œTo the Duke of Buckingham, do you say?--he who so passionately
seeks your charming society! Am I really to believe you are serious,
NA
â€œThe fact is, monsieur, you perceive, that everything seems to conspire
to make us pass the best, or rather the longest, part of our days
together. Yesterday it was the king who desired me to beg you to seat
yourself next to me at dinner; to-day, it is the Duke of Buckingham who

â€œLook yonder, at the turning of that path; he is just out of sight, with
Miss Stewart. Are these polite attentions usual in France, monsieur le

â€œI cannot very precisely say what people do in France, mademoiselle, for
I can hardly be called a Frenchman. I have resided in many countries,
and almost always as a soldier; and then, I have spent a long period of

NA
same time.

that the Duke of Buckingham should send you to me; and why did you come?

Raoul looked at the young lady with astonishment.
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo; for the duke is the most intimate friend of one whom I regard as a

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Raoul bent down his head, and Mary Grafton, sighing deeply, continued,
â€œThey are very happy. But, leave me, Monsieur de Bragelonne, for the
Duke of Buckingham has given you a very troublesome commission in
offering me as a companion for your promenade. Your heart is elsewhere,
and it is with the greatest difficulty you can be charitable enough to
lend me your attention. Confess truly; it would be unfair on your part,
NA
NA
She looked at him steadily. He was so noble and so handsome in his
bearing, his eyes revealed so much gentleness, candor, and resolution,
that the idea could not possibly enter her mind that he was either
rudely discourteous, or a mere simpleton. She only perceived, clearly
enough, that he loved another woman, and not herself, with the whole

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œIt is for me, then, to anticipate an explanation; you do not wish to
tell me anything, because you are now convinced that I do not love the
duke; because you see that I possibly might have loved you; because you
are a gentleman of noble and delicate sentiments; and because, instead
of accepting, even were it for the mere amusement of the passing hour,
a hand which is almost pressed upon you; and because, instead of meeting
my smiles with a smiling lip, you, who are young, have preferred to tell
me, whom men have called beautiful, â€˜My heart is over the sea--it is in
France.â€™ For this, I thank you, Monsieur de Bragelonne; you are, indeed,
a noble-hearted, noble-minded man, and I regard you all the more for it,
as a friend only. And now let us cease speaking of myself, and talk of
your own affairs. Forget that I have ever spoken to you of myself, tell
me why you are sad, and why you have become more than usually so during

Raoul was deeply and sensibly moved by these sweet and melancholy tones;
and as he could not, at the moment, find a word to say, the young girl
again came to his assistance.

affirm that I, too, am French in blood, as well as in feeling; but the
leaden atmosphere and characteristic gloom of England seem to weigh
upon me. Sometimes my dreams are golden-hued and full of wonderful
enjoyments, when suddenly a mist rises and overspreads my fancy,
blotting them out forever. Such, indeed, is the case at the present
moment. Forgive me; I have now said enough on that subject; give me your

NA
â€œYes, not only, I repeat it, that my mother was French, but, further, as
my father, a friend of King Charles I., was exiled in France, I, during
the trial of that prince, as well as during the Protectorâ€™s life, was
brought up in Paris; at the Restoration of King Charles II., my poor
father returned to England, where he died almost immediately afterwards;
and then the king created me a duchess, and has dowered me according to
my rank.

â€œI have a sister there, my senior by seven or eight years, who was
married in France, and was early left a widow; her name is Madame de
NA
NA
â€œShe, too, loves with her whole heart; and her last letters inform me
she is happy, and her affection is, I conclude, returned. I told you,
Monsieur de Bragelonne, that although I possess half of her nature, I do
not share her happiness. But let us now speak of yourself; whom do you

NA

Grafton.
NA
over a thousand times; she took it from his hand and read as follows:
â€œVICOMTE,--You are perfectly right to amuse yourself yonder with the
lovely faces of Charles II.â€™s court, for at Louis XIV.â€™s court, the
castle in which your affections are enshrined is being besieged. Stay in

NA
NA
NA
â€œVery good; but here is a second letter, from my friend De Guiche, which

oppression at her heart.
â€œMy intention, as soon as I received this letter, was immediately to

NA
NA
NA
â€œA singular circumstance, do you not think, for the court is now at
Paris? At all events, I would have set off; but when I mentioned my
intention to the king, he began to laugh, and said to me, â€˜How comes
it, monsieur lâ€™amassadeur, that you think of leaving? Has your sovereign
recalled you?â€™ I colored, naturally enough, for I was confused by the
question; for the fact is, the king himself sent me here, and I have

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAt least, she has not written to me since my departure, although she
used occasionally to write to me before. I trust she may have been

NA
And Buckingham at that moment was seen at the end of the walk,
approaching towards them, alone and smiling; he advanced slowly, and
NA
 he said.
NA
â€œAbout whatever might render you happy, dear Mary, and make Raoul less
NA
NA
â€œThat is my view of the subject, Miss Mary; do you wish me to mention it
NA
NA
indisposed to love M. de Bragelonne, that is useless, for I have told
NA
Buckingham reflected for a moment, and, without seeming in any way
discountenanced, as she expected, he said: â€œMy reason for leaving you
with M. de Bragelonne was, that I thoroughly knew your refined delicacy
of feeling, no less than the perfect loyalty of your mind and heart, and
I hoped that M. de Bragelonneâ€™s cure might be effected by the hands of a

â€œBut, my lord, before you spoke of M. de Bragelonneâ€™s heart, you spoke
to me of your own. Do you mean to effect the cure of two hearts at the

â€œPerfectly true, madame; but you will do me the justice to admit that
I have long discontinued a useless pursuit, acknowledging that my own
NA
NA
â€œM. de Bragelonne is happy, for he loves and is beloved. He has no need
NA
NA
a serious misfortune, and he has greater need than ever of sympathy and
NA
NA
â€œNo; gradually I will explain myself; but, if you desire it, I can tell
NA
â€œMy lord, you are putting me to the torture; you know something you wish

â€œI know that Miss Mary Grafton is the most charming object that a heart

â€œI have already told you that the Vicomte de Bragelonne loves

calm, collected manner peculiar to Englishmen.
Miss Grafton uttered a cry, which, together with the remark that
Buckingham had that moment made, spread oover De Bragelonneâ€™s features a
deadly paleness, arising from the sudden surprise, and also from a vague
NA
pronounced words which compel me, without a momentâ€™s delay, to seek
NA
NA
leave; and no one has the right to quit the service of the king for that
of any woman, even were she as worthy of being loved as Mary Grafton
NA
NA
NA
â€œI will remain, if you will promise to speak openly and without
NA
Thus far had their conversation proceeded, and Buckingham, in all
probability, was on the point of revealing, not indeed all that had
taken place, but at least all he was aware of, when one of the kingâ€™s
attendants appeared at the end of the terrace, and advanced towards the
summer-house where the king was sitting with Lucy Stewart. A courier
followed him, covered with dust from head to foot, and who seemed as if
he had but a few moments before dismounted from his horse.
NA
recognizing the princessâ€™s livery; and while the attendant and the
courier advanced towards the king, Buckingham and Miss Grafton exchanged
a look full of intelligence with each other.
Chapter XXXVIII. The Courier from Madame.
Charles II. was busily engaged in proving, or in endeavoring to prove,
to Miss Stewart that she was the only person for whom he cared at all,
and consequently was avowing to her an affection similar to that which
his ancestor Henry IV. had entertained for Gabrielle. Unfortunately for
Charles II., he had hit upon an unlucky day, the very day Miss Stewart
had taken it into her head to make him jealous, and therefore, instead
of being touched by his offer, as the king had hoped, she laughed
heartily.
NA
unfortunate enough to ask you for a proof of the affection you possess,
NA
NA
you know whether I care for them or not; the whole world envies me their
possession, as you well know also; my father commissioned Van Dyck to
purchase them. Would you like me to send them to your house this very
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œBe less generous, sire, and learn to love a little while longer, that
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThank Heaven, I have been so long enough; fourteen years of exile,
poverty, and misery, I think I may well regard it as a debt discharged;
NA
NA
â€œWhat! the Vicomte de Bragelonne? are you smitten too? By Heaven, they
will all grow mad over him one after the other; but he, on the contrary,
NA
NA
NA
â€œIf I wish it, you must do so, for you told me you were quite ready to

NA
NA
â€œYes, a proof that he is a simpleton; I allow him to fall in love with

â€œVery good; it seems, then, that if you were to find Miss Lucy Stewart
indifferent to you, you would console yourself by falling in love with
NA
â€œI donâ€™t say that; in the first place, you know that Mary Grafton does
not care for me; besides, a man can only console himself for a lost
affection by the discovery of a new one. Again, however, I repeat, the
question is not of myself, but of that young man. One might almost be
tempted to call the girl he has left behind him a Helen--a Helen before

â€œHe left Paris under orders, my dear Stewart; and prepare to be

â€œYou know very well that I am just as discreet as anybody else. And so
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes; and, will you believe it? the silly fellow, instead of thanking
NA
â€œWhat! thank the king for depriving him of the woman he loves! Really,
NA
â€œBut, pray understand me. If she whom the king had run off with was
either a Miss Grafton or a Miss Stewart, I should not be of his opinion;
nay, I should even think him not half wretched enough; but she is a
little, thin, lame thing. Deuce take such fidelity as that! Surely, one
can hardly understand how a man can refuse a girl who is rich for one
who is poverty itself--a girl who loves him for one who deceives and
NA
NA
NA
â€œVery good! the vicomte will settle down in England, for Mary has a
clear head, and when she fixes her mind upon anything, she does so
NA
â€œTake care, my dear Miss Stewart; if the vicomte has any idea of
adopting our country, he has not long to do so, for it was only the day
NA
NA
â€œI should think so, indeed; my royal brother is far too anxious for his
absence; and, for myself, my _amour propre_ is enlisted on his side, for
I will never have it said that I had held out as a bait to this young
NA
NA
â€œI do not allude to Miss Stewart, for she is worthy of a kingâ€™s
devotion; and since she has captivated me I trust that no one else will
be caught by her; I say, therefore, finally, that the attention I have
shown this young man will not have been thrown away; he will stay with
NA
â€œAnd I hope that when he is once married and settled, instead of being
angry with your majesty, he will be grateful to you, for every one tries
his utmost to please him; even the Duke of Buckingham, whose brilliancy,

â€œIncluding Miss Stewart even, who calls him the most finished gentleman
NA
â€œStay, sire; you have spoken quite enough, and quite highly enough, of
Miss Grafton, to overlook what I may have said about De Bragelonne. But,
by the by, sire, your kindness for some time past astonishes me: you
think of those who are absent, you forgive those who have done you a
wrong, in fact, you are as nearly as possible, perfect. How does it
NA
NA
laugh.
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, then, the true motive is that Buckingham strongly recommended the
young man to me, saying: â€˜Sire, I begin by yielding up all claim to Miss

The courier retired with the valet. Charles went to the window, which he
opened, and leaning forward, called out--â€œDuke! Buckingham! come here,
NA
The duke hurried to him, in obedience to the summons; but when he
reached the door, and perceived Miss Stewart, he hesitated to enter.
NA
perceiving in what an excellent humor the king was, he advanced,
smiling, towards him. â€œWell, my dear duke, how do you get on with your

NA
â€œBecause charming Miss Grafton is willing to marry him, but he is

â€œIf it were to be simply deceived, that is nothing; but, to look at him,
NA
â€œAt a distance, and with Miss Graftonâ€™s aid, the blow will be warded
NA
â€œFar from it, far from it; neither distance nor Miss Graftonâ€™s help will
be of the slightest avail. Bragelonne will set off for Paris within an

Buckingham started, and Miss Stewart opened her eyes very wide in
astonishment.
NA
â€œThat is to say, my dear Buckingham, that it is impossible until it

in his ante-chamber at Blois. He has M. dâ€™Artagnan, and what better
guardian could the king have than M. dâ€™Artagnan? I should make myself
perfectly easy with twenty storms of passion, such as Bragelonne might

â€œBut I entreat your majesty, who is so good and kind, to reflect a

Buckingham slowly took hold of Madameâ€™s letter, and trembling with
emotion, read the following words:
â€œFor your own sake, for mine, for the honor and safety of every one,
send M. de Bragelonne back to France immediately. Your devoted sister,

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou have not read the postscript, Villiers; it is under the fold of the
NA
fold of the letter, he read:
NA
The dukeâ€™s head sank gradually on his breast; the paper trembled in
his fingers, as if it had been changed to lead. The king paused for a
moment, and, seeing that Buckingham did not speak, â€œHe must follow his
NA
of grief in this world; I have had my own,--I have had that of
others who belong to me,--and have thus had a double weight of woe to
endure!--But the deuce take all my cares now! Go, and bring our friend

The duke opened the trellised door of the summer-house, and pointing at
Raoul and Mary, who were walking together side by side, said, â€œWhat a
NA
NA
together; â€œevery one seems to be sentimental here. There, look at Miss

The duke called to Raoul, and taking Miss Grafton by the hand, he led
her towards the king.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo, sire; your majesty had no doubt excellent reasons for withholding
it; for you are so wise and so good that everything you do is well
NA
â€œI alleged, I believe, as a reason, that the king of France had not

NA
â€œWell, M. de Bragelonne, I have reflected over the matter since; if
the king did not, in fact, fix your return, he begged me to render your
sojourn in England as agreeable as possible; since, however, you ask my
permission to return, it is because your longer residence in England is

At this moment Raoul turned towards the door, against which Miss Grafton
was leaning, pale and sorrow-stricken; her other hand was passed through
the dukeâ€™s arm.

a position to satisfy you; whenever you please, therefore, you can leave

Raoul, astounded, stammered out a few broken sentences, which equally
answered the purpose both of thanks and of excuse.
â€œI therefore bid you adieu, Monsieur de Bragelonne, and wish you every

Miss Grafton felt her limbs almost giving way; and, as Raoul received
the ring from the kingâ€™s hand, he, too, felt his strength and courage
failing him. He addressed a few respectful words to the king, a passing
compliment to Miss Stewart, and looked for Buckingham to bid him adieu.
The king profited by this moment to disappear. Raoul found the duke
engaged in endeavoring to encourage Miss Grafton.

animation; â€œI am not one of those women who have more pride than heart;
if she whom he loves is in France, let him return thither and bless me
for having advised him to go and seek his happiness there. If, on the
contrary, she shall have ceased to love him, let him come back here
again; I shall still love him, and his unhappiness will not have
lessened him in my regard. In the arms of my house you will find that
which Heaven has engraven on my heart--_Habenti parum, egenti cuncta_.

of me, as you have endeavored to make me believe, I will tear her image

Mary Grafton gazed upon him with an expression of the most indefinable
pity, and Raoul returned her look with a sweet, sorrowful smile, saying,

for you,--give me leave to offer it for your acceptance: if I marry in

Mary understood the look that Buckingham fixed upon her.

destroyed, his mistress lost to him. His honor even has not escaped.
What will be left him, then, Mary, equal to your affection? Answer,

Miss Grafton placed her white hand on Buckinghamâ€™s arm, and, while Raoul
was hurrying away with headlong speed, she repeated in dying accents the
line from Romeo and Juliet:
NA
As she finished the last word, Raoul disappeared. Miss Grafton returned
to her own apartments, paler than death. Buckingham availed himself of
the arrival of the courier, who had brought the letter to the king,
to write to Madame and to the Comte de Guiche. The king had not been
mistaken, for at two in the morning the tide was at full flood, and
Raoul had embarked for France.
Chapter XXXIX. Saint-Aignan Follows Malicorneâ€™s Advice.
The king most assiduously followed the progress which was made in La
Valliereâ€™s portrait; and did so with a care and attention arising as
much from a desire that it should resemble her as from the wish that the
painter should prolong the period of its completion as much as possible.
It was amusing to observe him follow the artistâ€™s brush, awaiting the
completion of a particular plan, or the result of a combination of
colors, and suggesting various modifications to the painter, which the
latter consented to adopt with the most respectful docility. And again,
when the artist, following Malicorneâ€™s advice, was a little late in
arriving, and when Saint-Aignan had been obliged to be absent for some
time, it was interesting to observe, though no one witnessed them, those
moments of silence full of deep expression, which united in one sigh
two souls most disposed to understand each other, and who by no means
objected to the quiet meditation they enjoyed together. The minutes flew
rapidly by, as if on wings, and as the king drew closer to Louise
and bent his burning gaze upon her, a noise was suddenly heard in the
ante-room. It was the artist, who had just arrived; Saint-Aignan, too,
had returned, full of apologies; and the king began to talk and
La Valliere to answer him very hurriedly, their eyes revealing to
Saint-Aignan that they had enjoyed a century of happiness during his
absence. In a word, Malicorne, philosopher that he was, though he knew
it not, had learned how to inspire the king with an appetite in the
midst of plenty, and with desire in the assurance of possession. La
Valliereâ€™s fears of interruption had never been realized, and no one
imagined she was absent from her apartment two or three hours every day;
she pretended that her health was very uncertain; those who went to her
room always knocked before entering, and Malicorne, the man of so many
ingenious inventions, had constructed an acoustic piece of mechanism, by
means of which La Valliere, when in Saint-Aignanâ€™s apartment, was
always forewarned of any visits which were paid to the room she usually
inhabited. In this manner, therefore, without leaving her room, and
having no _confidante_, she was able to return to her apartment, thus
removing by her appearance, a little tardy perhaps, the suspicions of
the most determined skeptics. Malicorne having asked Saint-Aignan the
next morning what news he had to report, the latter was obliged to
confess that the quarter of an hourâ€™s liberty had made the king in most

NA
They were so desirous for it, however, that on the evening of the fourth
day, at the moment when the painter was packing up his implements,
during Saint-Aignanâ€™s continued absence, Saint-Aignan on his return
noticed upon La Valliereâ€™s face a shade of disappointment and vexation,
which she could not conceal. The king was less reserved, and exhibited
his annoyance by a very significant shrug of the shoulders, at which La
NA
NA
was, when it was reported to him.

inventions and contrivances; and while sorcerers are enabled by means of
their astrolabe to take the altitude of the sun, moon, and stars, I
am satisfied merely by looking into peopleâ€™s faces, in order to see if
their eyes are encircled with dark lines, and if the mouth describes a
NA
And the cunning Malicorne had every opportunity of watching narrowly
and closely, for the very same evening the king accompanied the queen
to Madameâ€™s apartments, and made himself so remarked by his serious face
and his deep sigh, and looked at La Valliere with such a languishing
expression, that Malicorne said to Montalais during the evening:
NA
the Jardins Saint-Paul to request him to postpone the next sitting for
a couple of days. Saint-Aignan was not within, when La Valliere, who
was now quite familiar with the lower story, lifted up the trap-door and
descended. The king, as usual was waiting for her on the staircase,
and held a bouquet in his hand; as soon as he saw her, he clasped her
tenderly in his arms. La Valliere, much moved at the action, looked
around the room, but as she saw the king was alone, she did not complain
of it. They sat down, the king reclining near the cushions on which
Louise was seated, with his head supported by her knees, placed there as
in an asylum whence no one could banish him; he gazed ardently upon her,
and as if the moment had arrived when nothing could interpose between
their two hearts; she, too, gazed with similar passion upon him, and
from her eyes, so softly pure, emanated a flame, whose rays first
kindled and then inflamed the heart of the king, who, trembling with
happiness as Louiseâ€™s hand rested on his head, grew giddy from excess
of joy, and momentarily awaited either the painterâ€™s or Saint-Aignanâ€™s
return to break the sweet illusion. But the door remained closed, and
neither Saint-Aignan nor the painter appeared, nor did the hangings even
move. A deep mysterious silence reigned in the room--a silence which
seemed to influence even the song-birds in their gilded prisons. The
king, completely overcome, turned round his head and buried his burning
lips in La Valliereâ€™s hands, who, herself faint, with excess of emotion,
pressed her trembling hands against her loverâ€™s lips. Louis threw
himself upon his knees, and as La Valliere did not move her head, the
kingâ€™s forehead being within reach of her lips, she furtively passed
her lips across the perfumed locks which caressed her cheeks. The king
seized her in his arms, and, unable to resist the temptation, they
exchanged their first kiss, that burning kiss, which changes love into
delirium. Suddenly, a noise upon the upper floor was heard, which had,
in fact, continued, though it had remained unnoticed, for some time; it
had at last aroused La Valliereâ€™s attention, though but slowly so. As
the noise, however, continued, as it forced itself upon the attention,
and recalled the poor girl from her dreams of happiness to the sad
realities of life, she rose in a state of utter bewilderment, though
beautiful in her disorder, saying:
NA
NA
NA
But she gently shook her head, as she replied: â€œHappiness hidden...
NA
The noise was again resumed.
NA
the king followed her, unable to let her leave his sight, and covering

invoking a blessing, attempted to speak, but could not articulate one

Montalais made a sign to Raoul, who stood almost petrified at the door,
and did not even attempt to advance another step into the room.

And she advanced towards the corner of the room to close the screen, and
also, behind the screen, the trap-door. But suddenly the king, who had
heard Louiseâ€™s exclamation, darted through the opening, and hurried
forward to her assistance. He threw himself on his knees before her, as
he overwhelmed Montalais with questions, who hardly knew where she was.
At the moment, however, when the king threw himself on his knees, a cry
of utter despair rang through the corridor, accompanied by the sound of
retreating footsteps. The king wished to see who had uttered the cry and
whose were the footsteps he had heard; and it was in vain that Montalais
sought to retain him, for Louis, quitting his hold of La Valliere,
hurried towards the door, too late, however, for Raoul was already at a
distance, and the king only beheld a shadow that quickly vanished in the
silent corridor. [8]
Chapter XL: Two Old Friends.
Whilst every one at court was busily engaged with his own affairs, a man
mysteriously took up his post behind the Place de Greve, in the
house which we once saw besieged by Dâ€™Artagnan on the occasion of the
_emeute_. The principal entrance of the house was in the Place Baudoyer;
it was tolerably large, surrounded by gardens, inclosed in the Rue
Saint-Jean by the shops of toolmakers, which protected it from prying
looks, and was walled in by a triple rampart of stone, noise, and
verdure, like an embalmed mummy in its triple coffin. The man we have
just alluded to walked along with a firm step, although he was no longer
in his early prime. His dark cloak and long sword plainly revealed
one who seemed in search of adventures; and, judging from his curling
mustache, his fine smooth skin, which could be seen beneath his
_sombrero_, it would not have been difficult to pronounce that gallantry
had not a little share in his adventures. In fact, hardly had the
cavalier entered the house, when the clock struck eight; and ten minutes
afterwards a lady, followed by a servant armed to the teeth, approached
and knocked at the same door, which an old woman immediately opened for
her. The lady raised her veil as she entered; though no longer beautiful
or young, she was still active and of an imposing carriage. She
concealed, beneath a rich toilette and the most exquisite taste, an age
which Ninon de lâ€™Enclos alone could have smiled at with impunity. Hardly
had she reached the vestibule, when the cavalier, whose features we have
only roughly sketched, advanced towards her, holding out his hand.
NA
NA
He led her to a most elegantly furnished apartment, on whose high
windows were reflected the expiring rays of the setting sun, which
filtered gaudily through the dark green needles of the adjacent firs.
They sat down side by side. Neither of them thought of asking for
additional light in the room, and they buried themselves as it were in
the shadow, as if they wished to bury themselves in forgetfulness.

presence there on the day of the Franciscanâ€™s death, and your initiation

 said Aramis, smiling without apprehension in the growing gloom by which
the room was overcast, for it could not reveal that his smile was less
agreeable and not so bright as formerly.
â€œNo, chevalier, at the present day we have other interests. Every
period of life brings its own; and, as we now understand each other in
conversing, as perfectly as we formerly did without saying a word, let

â€œI am at your orders, duchesse. Ah! I beg your pardon, how did you

â€œYou ask me why? I have told you. Curiosity in the first place. I wished
to know what you could have to do with the Franciscan, with whom I had
certain business transactions, and who died so singularly. You know that
on the occasion of our interview at Fontainebleau, in the cemetery, at
the foot of the grave so recently closed, we were both so much overcome
by our emotions that we omitted to confide to each other what we may

NA
â€œWell, then, I had no sooner left you than I repented, and have ever
since been most anxious to ascertain the truth. You know that Madame de
NA
NA
NA
said anything to the other in the cemetery; that you did not speak of
the relationship in which you stood to the Franciscan, whose burial you
superintended, and that I did not refer to the position in which I
stood to him; all which seemed very unworthy of two such old friends as
ourselves, and I have sought an opportunity of an interview with you in
order to give you some information that I have recently acquired, and to
assure you that Marie Michon, now no more, has left behind her one who

Aramis bowed over the duchessâ€™s hand, and pressed his lips upon it. â€œYou

NA
Aramis wished to give it; â€œbut I knew you were a friend of M. Fouquetâ€™s,

_that_. A poor priest who has been favored by a generous protector, and
whose heart is full of gratitude and devotion, is all that I pretend to

undertaken a voyage to your diocese, which is Belle-Ile-en-Mer, I

â€œAh! I had been told that Belle-Isle was fortified; besides, I know how

 said Aramis, annoyed.
â€œSuffice it to know that I learned you had returned from Vannes, and
I sent off to one of our friends, M. le Comte de la Fere, who is
discretion itself, in order to ascertain it, but he answered that he was

NA
NA
â€œWell, then, you know that I cannot venture to show myself here, and

â€œOh! there are various reasons for it. But, to continue, being obliged
to conceal myself, I was fortunate enough to meet with M. dâ€™Artagnan,
NA
NA
â€œHe gave me certain information, and sent me to M. Baisemeaux, the

his eyes in the darkness of the room, which he could not conceal

befitting manner.

â€œAnd the address of a creditor is as easily ascertained as that of a

freely again, which Aramis, however, could not succeed in doing. â€œWe had

â€œIn that case we must have been speaking about the grudge you have

NA
NA
interrupting her eagerly, â€œwell, I am listening to you very

â€œTerrible indeed; this obliged me to resort to some means of obtaining a
livelihood, and, particularly, to avoid vegetating for the remainder of
my existence. I had old hatreds to turn to account, old friendships to

me a service, but was unable. He gave me recommendations, however, to
Flanders, both for myself and for Laicques too; and conferred a pension

NA
â€œExcept for a conscientious scruple, duchesse, you will admit that it is

NA
â€œYes; but Dampierre is burdened, mortgaged, and almost fallen to ruin,
NA
â€œAnd can the queen-mother know and see all that, without shedding a

but darkness.
NA
NA
â€œYes; but, most singularly, the young king inherits the antipathy his
dear father had for me. You will, perhaps, tell me that I am indeed a

â€œDear duchesse, pray come quickly to the cause that brought you here;
NA
â€œSuch has been my own thought. I came to Fontainebleau with a double
object in view. In the first place, I was summoned there by the
Franciscan whom you knew. By the by, how did you know him?--for I have
NA
â€œI knew him in a very natural way, duchesse. I studied theology with him
at Parma. We became fast friends; and it happened, from time to time,
NA
NA
NA
â€œBut by what extraordinary chance did it happen that you were at the
NA
NA
world. I was going to Fontainebleau to see M. Fouquet, for the purpose
of obtaining an audience of the king. I was passing by, unknown; I saw
the poor dying monk in the road, and recognized him immediately. You
NA
â€œYes; but bequeathing to you so vast a power that you issue your

you. I thought I had given you the necessary signature to enable you to

mystery, and such a majestic presence, that it is generally believed you

cleared up some of my doubts on the point. Every general of the Jesuits
is nominated by him, and must be a Spaniard, according to the statutes
of the order. You are not a Spaniard, nor have you been nominated by the

Aramis did not reply to this remark, except to say, â€œYou see, duchesse,
NA
â€œYes, my dear Aramis; but there was something else which I have been

NA
â€œYou know, I believe, something about most things, and it occurred to me

â€œEvery Frenchman who has been actively engaged in the Fronde knows

are indispensable. You have upwards of four years--more than double the

NA

â€œWhy did you not render the same service to M. de Laicques, duchesse? He
NA
â€œYes, no doubt; but, at all events, putting Laicques aside, will you

NA
NA
â€œIf you refuse me in this manner, it is not very encouraging for me,

NA
NA

NA
NA
NA
â€œBecause I have, or rather Laicques has, certain letters in his
possession from Cardinal Mazarin, which establish the existence of very

very distinctly remember what they are; but they establish the fact
that the superintendent, according to these letters, which are signed by
Mazarin, had taken thirteen millions of francs from the coffers of the

things as these--you, too, who held M. de Mazarinâ€™s prose effusions in

distressing to you to be obliged to have recourse to such a means. It is

â€œYes; no more. Do you think it much? I require at least as much as that

NA
â€œI say, therefore, that instead of asking for this amount, I should
have gone to see my old friend the queen-mother; the letters from her
husband, Signor Mazarini, would have served me as an introduction, and
I should have begged this mere trifle of her, saying to her, â€˜I wish,
madame, to have the honor of receiving you at Dampierre. Permit me to

The duchesse paused and reflected for a moment, and then said, â€œThat is

This remark made the chevalier prick up his ears; and from the moment
his adversary had committed this error, his mind was so thoroughly on

more; and she, consequently, to lose it. â€œI will admit, for argumentâ€™s

your children, your poor pensioners, and various other persons will

compromising they may be in their nature, are not worth from three

But the duchesse had said enough, and advanced a few steps towards the
door. Aramis, however, had reserved one exposure which she did _not_
expect.
He rang the bell, candles immediately appeared in the adjoining room,
and the bishop found himself completely encircled by lights, which shone
upon the worn, haggard face of the duchesse, revealing every feature
but too clearly. Aramis fixed a long ironical look upon her pale, thin,
withered cheeks--her dim, dull eyes--and upon her lips, which she kept
carefully closed over her discolored scanty teeth. He, however,
had thrown himself into a graceful attitude, with his haughty and
intelligent head thrown back; he smiled so as to reveal teeth still
brilliant and dazzling. The antiquated coquette understood the trick
that had been played her. She was standing immediately before a large
mirror, in which her decrepitude, so carefully concealed, was only made
more manifest. And, thereupon, without even saluting Aramis, who bowed
with the ease and grace of the musketeer of early days, she hurried
away with trembling steps, which her very precipitation only the more
impeded. Aramis sprang across the room, like a zephyr, to lead her to
the door. Madame de Chevreuse made a sign to her servant, who resumed
his musket, and she left the house where such tender friends had not
been able to understand each other only because they had understood each
other too well.
Chapter XLI. Wherein May Be Seen that a Bargain Which Cannot Be Made
with One Person, Can Be Carried Out with Another.
Aramis had been perfectly correct in his supposition; for hardly had she
left the house in the Place Baudoyer than Madame de Chevreuse proceeded
homeward. She was doubtless afraid of being followed, and by this means
thought she might succeed in throwing those who might be following her
off their guard; but scarcely had she arrived within the door of the
hotel, and hardly had assured herself that no one who could cause her
any uneasiness was on her track, when she opened the door of the garden,
leading into another street, and hurried towards the Rue Croix des
Petits-Champs, where M. Colbert resided.
We have already said that evening, or rather night, had closed in; it
was a dark, thick night, besides; Paris had once more sunk into its
calm, quiescent state, enshrouding alike within its indulgent mantle the
high-born duchesse carrying out her political intrigue, and the simple
citizenâ€™s wife, who, having been detained late by a supper in the city,
was making her way slowly homewards, hanging on the arm of a lover,
by the shortest possible route. Madame de Chevreuse had been too well
accustomed to nocturnal political intrigues to be ignorant that a
minister never denies himself, even at his own private residence, to
any young and beautiful woman who may chance to object to the dust and
confusion of a public office, or to old women, as full of experience
as of years, who dislike the indiscreet echo of official residences. A
valet received the duchesse under the peristyle, and received her, it
must be admitted, with some indifference of manner; he intimated, after
having looked at her face, that it was hardly at such an hour that one
so advanced in years as herself could be permitted to disturb Monsieur
Colbertâ€™s important occupations. But Madame de Chevreuse, without
looking or appearing to be annoyed, wrote her name upon a leaf of her
tablets--a name which had but too frequently sounded so disagreeably in
the ears of Louis XIII. and of the great cardinal. She wrote her name in
the large, ill-formed characters of the higher classes of that period,
handed it to the valet, without uttering a word, but with so haughty and
imperious a gesture, that the fellow, well accustomed to judge of people
from their manners and appearance, perceived at once the quality of the
person before him, bowed his head, and ran to M. Colbertâ€™s room. The
minister could not control a sudden exclamation as he opened the paper;
and the valet, gathering from it the interest with which his master
regarded the mysterious visitor, returned as fast as he could to beg the
duchesse to follow him. She ascended to the first floor of the beautiful
new house very slowly, rested herself on the landing-place, in order not
to enter the apartment out of breath, and appeared before M. Colbert,
who, with his own hands, held both the folding doors open. The duchesse
paused at the threshold, for the purpose of well studying the character
of the man with whom she was about to converse. At the first glance,
the round, large, heavy head, thick brows, and ill-favored features of
Colbert, who wore, thrust low down on his head, a cap like a priestâ€™s
_calotte_, seemed to indicate that but little difficulty was likely
to be met with in her negotiations with him, but also that she was to
expect as little interest in the discussion of particulars; for there
was scarcely any indication that the rough and uncouth nature of the man
was susceptible to the impulses of a refined revenge, or of an exalted
ambition. But when, on closer inspection, the duchesse perceived the
small, piercingly black eyes, the longitudinal wrinkles of his high and
massive forehead, the imperceptible twitching of the lips, on which were
apparent traces of rough good-humor, Madame de Chevreuse altered her
opinion of him, and felt she could say to herself: â€œI have found the man
NA
â€œWhat is the subject, madame, which procures me the honor of a visit
NA
NA
NA
â€œI am delighted, madame, with the first portion of your sentence; but,

Madame de Chevreuse sat down in the armchair which M. Colbert advanced
towards her. â€œMonsieur Colbert, you are the intendant of finances, and

I may be towards a lady of your position and merit, nothing will make
me confess that I have ever entertained the idea of supplanting my

â€œI said nothing about supplanting, Monsieur Colbert. Could I
accidentally have made use of that word? I hardly think that likely.
The word â€˜replaceâ€™ is less aggressive in its signification, and
more grammatically suitable, as M. de Voiture would say. I presume,
NA
â€œM. Fouquetâ€™s fortune, madame, enables him to withstand all attempts.
The superintendent in this age plays the part of the Colossus of Rhodes;
NA
â€œI ought to have availed myself precisely of that very comparison. It
is true, M. Fouquet plays the part of the Colossus of Rhodes; but I
remember to have heard it said by M. Conrart, a member of the academy, I
believe, that when the Colossus of Rhodes fell from its lofty position,
the merchant who had cast it down--a merchant, nothing more, M.
Colbert--loaded four hundred camels with the ruins. A merchant! and that

NA
â€œVery good, Monsieur Colbert, since you persist in showing so much
sensitiveness with me, as if you were ignorant that I am Madame de
Chevreuse, and also that I am somewhat advanced in years; in other
words, that you have to do with a woman who has had political dealings
with the Cardinal Richelieu, and who has no time to lose; as, I repeat,
you do not hesitate to commit such an imprudence, I shall go and find
others who are more intelligent and more desirous of making their
NA
NA
â€œYou give me a very poor idea of negotiations of the present day.
I assure you that if, in my earlier days, a woman had gone to M.
de Cinq-Mars, who was not, moreover, a man of a very high order of
intellect, and had said to him about the cardinal what I have just said
to you of M. Fouquet, M. de Cinq-Mars would by this time have already
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAgain, a word too much; it is quite evident that, if you have not yet
succeeded in driving M. Fouquet from his post, it is because you have
not been able to do so. Therefore, I should be the greatest simpleton
possible if, in coming to you, I did not bring the very thing you

NA
after a silence which enabled the duchesse to sound the depths of
his dissimulation, â€œbut I must warn you that, for the last six years,
denunciation after denunciation has been made against M. Fouquet, and he

â€œThere is a time for everything, Monsieur Colbert; those who were the
authors of those denunciations were not called Madame de Chevreuse, and
they had no proofs equal to the six letters from M. de Mazarin which

NA
NA
NA
â€œNothing less. It is rather strange, M. Colbert, but your face, which

NA
NA

â€œIt embraces the post of superintendent of finance for yourself, and a

â€œForgive me, madame la duchesse, but it is almost impossible that M.
Fouquet can be exiled; to be imprisoned or disgraced, that is already a

Chevreuse, coldly. â€œI do not live at such a distance from Paris as not
to know what takes place there. The king does not like M. Fouquet, and
he would willingly sacrifice M. Fouquet if an opportunity were only
NA
NA
â€œGood enough, and one I estimate to be worth five hundred thousand

NA
â€œI mean, monsieur, that holding this opportunity in my own hands, I will
not allow it to be transferred to yours except for a sum of five hundred

â€œI understand you perfectly, madame. But since you have fixed a price
NA
â€œOh, a mere trifle; six letters, as I have already told you, from M. de
Mazarin; and the autographs will most assuredly not be regarded as too
highly priced, if they establish, in an irrefutable manner, that
M. Fouquet has embezzled large sums of money from the treasury and
NA
NA
sparkled with delight.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
said.
NA
â€œYes, madame, yes; M. Mazarin must have handed the money to M. Fouquet,
who must have kept it for his own purposes; but the question is, what
NA
â€œExactly,--what money; if we come to terms I will join to these six
NA
NA
â€œA useless question to ask; exactly as if I were to ask you, Monsieur
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo; for there is one circumstance to which neither of us has given any

NA
â€œM. Fouquet can be utterly ruined, under the legal circumstances you

NA
â€œA public scandal, for instance; and yet neither the legal proceedings
NA
NA
â€œBecause he is procureur-general of the parliament; because, too,
in France, all public administrators, the army, justice itself, and
commerce, are intimately connected by ties of good-fellowship, which
people call _esprit de corps_. In such a case, madame, the parliament
will never permit its chief to be dragged before a public tribunal; and
never, even if he be dragged there by royal authority, never, I say,
NA
NA
â€œI am aware of that, madame; but I have to do with it, and it
consequently diminishes the value of what you have brought to show me.
What good can a proof of a crime be to me, without the possibility of

not think you were so impressionable. Very good; in that case, since you
need more than I have to give you, there is no occasion to speak of the

â€œYes, madame, we will go on talking of it; only, as the value of your

The duchesse laughed in his face, and then said, suddenly, â€œWait a
moment, I have another arrangement to propose; will you give me three
NA
NA
â€œOh, you can either accept or refuse my terms; besides, that is not
NA
NA
â€œLess so than you think, perhaps, for it is not money I am going to ask
NA
NA
â€œA service; you know that I have always been most affectionately
attached to the queen, and I am desirous of having an interview with her
NA
NA
â€œYes, Monsieur Colbert, with the queen, who is, I admit, no longer my
friend, and who has ceased to be so for a long time past, but who may
NA
â€œHer majesty has ceased to receive any one, madame. She is a great
sufferer, and you may be aware that the paroxysms of her disease occur
NA
â€œThat is the very reason why I wish to have an interview with her
majesty; for in Flanders there is a great variety of these kinds of
NA
NA
â€œDo not believe that, Monsieur Colbert. The Flemish peasant is somewhat
a man of nature, and his companion for life is not alone a wife, but a
female laborer also; for while he is smoking his pipe, the woman works:
it is she who draws the water from the well; she who loads the mule
or the ass, and even bears herself a portion of the burden. Taking but
little care of herself, she gets knocked about first in one direction,
and then in another, and very often is beaten by her husband, and
NA
NA
â€œThe Flemish women do not die the sooner on that account. When they are
great sufferers from this disease they go in search of remedies, and the
Beguines of Bruges are excellent doctors for every kind of disease. They
have precious waters of one sort or another; specifics of various kinds;
and they give a bottle of it and a wax candle to the sufferer, whereby
the priests are gainers, and Heaven is served by the disposal of both
their wares. I will take the queen some of this holy water, which I will
procure from the Beguines of Bruges; her majesty will recover, and will
burn as many wax candles as she may see fit. You see, Monsieur Colbert,
to prevent my seeing the queen is almost as bad as committing the crime
NA
â€œYou are undoubtedly, madame la duchesse, a woman of exceedingly great
abilities, and I am more than astounded at their display; still I cannot
but suppose that this charitable consideration towards the queen in some
NA
â€œI have not given myself the trouble to conceal it, that I am aware
of, Monsieur Colbert. You said, I believe, that I had a slight personal
interest? On the contrary, it is a very great interest, and I will prove
it to you, by resuming what I was saying. If you procure me a personal
interview with her majesty, I will be satisfied with the three hundred
thousand francs I have claimed; if not, I shall keep my letters, unless,

And rising from her seat with this decisive remark, the old duchesse
plunged M. Colbert into a disagreeable perplexity. To bargain any
further was out of the question; and not to bargain was to pay a great
NA
of handing over a hundred thousand crowns; but how shall I get the

â€œIn the simplest manner in the world, my dear Monsieur Colbert--whom

The financier began to laugh, silently, so that his large eyebrows went
up and down like the wings of a bat, upon the deep lines of his yellow
NA
NA
NA
â€œI mean that, if you would take the trouble to accompany me to the place
where the letters are, they would be delivered into your own hands, and
NA
NA
â€œYou would bring the hundred thousand crowns with you at the same time,
NA
Colbert colored to the tips of his ears. Like all eminent men in the art
of figures, he was of an insolent and mathematical probity. â€œI will
NA
NA
â€œWould that the orders on your treasury were for two millions, monsieur
NA
NA
NA
Colbert coughed like an irresolute man. He imagined, for a moment, that
the proposition of the duchesse was a snare; that perhaps some one was
waiting at the door; and that she whose secret had just been sold to
Colbert for a hundred thousand crowns, had already offered it to Fouquet
for the same sum. As he still hesitated, the duchesse looked at him full
in the face.
NA
NA
â€œYou suppose I am going to lead you into a snare or trap of some sort or
NA
â€œMadame la duchesse, you have the character of being somewhat
inconsiderate at times, as I am reputed a sober, solemn character, a

â€œYes; the fact is, you are afraid. Well, then, take your own carriage,
as many servants as you like, only think well of what I am going to say.
What we two may arrange between ourselves, we are the only persons who
will know--if a third person is present we might as well tell the whole
world about it. After all, I do not make a point of it; my carriage
shall follow yours, and I shall be satisfied to accompany you in your

â€œHave you forgotten that already? Is it possible that one of the clauses
of the agreement of so much importance to me, can have escaped you so
soon? How trifling it seems to you, indeed; if I had known it I should

â€œThe trait is a fine one, Monsieur Colbert, and I will reward you for

Madame de Chevreuseâ€™s laugh was a very sinister sound; a man with youth,
faith, love, life itself, throbbing in his heart, would prefer a sob to
such a lamentable laugh. The duchesse opened the front of her dress and
drew forth from her bosom, somewhat less white than it once had been,
a small packet of papers, tied with a flame-colored ribbon, and, still
laughing, she said, â€œThere, Monsieur Colbert, are the originals of
NA
refastening the body of her dress; â€œyour fortune is secured. And now
NA
â€œNo, madame; if you are again about to run the chance of her majestyâ€™s
displeasure, and it were known at the Palais Royal that I had been the
means of introducing you there, the queen would never forgive me while
she lived. No; there are certain persons at the palace who are devoted

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThat is again your own affair, madame. I am going to give directions
to the head valet of the gentleman in waiting on the queen to allow
admission to a Beguine, who brings an effectual remedy for her majestyâ€™s
sufferings. You are the bearer of my letter, you will undertake to
be provided with the remedy, and will give every explanation on the
subject. I admit a knowledge of a Beguine, but I deny all knowledge
of Madame de Chevreuse. Here, madame, then, is your letter of
NA
Chapter XLII. The Skin of the Bear.
Colbert handed the duchesse the letter, and gently drew aside the chair
behind which she was standing; Madame de Chevreuse, with a very slight
bow, immediately left the room. Colbert, who had recognized Mazarinâ€™s
handwriting, and had counted the letters, rang to summon his secretary,
whom he enjoined to go in immediate search of M. Vanel, a counselor
of the parliament. The secretary replied that, according to his usual
practice, M. Vanel had just that moment entered the house, in order to
give the intendant an account of the principal details of the business
which had been transacted during the day in parliament. Colbert
approached one of the lamps, read the letters of the deceased cardinal
over again, smiled repeatedly as he recognized the great value of the
papers Madame de Chevreuse had just delivered--and burying his head in
his hands for a few minutes, reflected profoundly. In the meantime, a
tall, loosely-made man entered the room; his spare, thin face, steady
look, and hooked nose, as he entered Colbertâ€™s cabinet, with a
modest assurance of manner, revealed a character at once supple and
decided,--supple towards the master who could throw him the prey,
firm towards the dogs who might possibly be disposed to dispute its
possession. M. Vanel carried a voluminous bundle of papers under his
arm, and placed it on the desk on which Colbert was leaning both his
elbows, as he supported his head.

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou are so in point of fact, and I call you monseigneur accordingly;
besides you are seigneur for _me_, and that is sufficient; if you
dislike my calling you monseigneur before others, allow me, at least, to
NA
Colbert raised his head as if to read, or try to read, upon Vanelâ€™s
face how much or how little sincerity entered into this protestation
of devotion. But the counselor knew perfectly well how to sustain the
weight of such a look, even backed with the full authority of the title
he had conferred. Colbert sighed; he could not read anything in Vanelâ€™s
face, and Vanel might possibly be honest in his professions, but Colbert
recollected that this man, inferior to himself in every other respect,
was actually his master in virtue of the fact of his having a wife.
As he was pitying this manâ€™s lot, Vanel coldly drew from his pocket a
perfumed letter, sealed with Spanish wax, and held it towards Colbert,
NA
Colbert coughed, took, opened and read the letter, and then put it
carefully away in his pocket, while Vanel turned over the leaves of
the papers he had brought with him with an unmoved and unconcerned air.
NA
NA
NA
â€œImpossible. A counselor need not work more than three hours a day in

of accounts, and, as I still have spare time on my hands, I am studying

â€œThere is one, certainly, but one need be almost the king himself to be
able to buy it without inconvenience; and the king will not be inclined,

At these words, Vanel fixed his peculiar, humble, dull look upon
Colbert, who could hardly tell whether Vanel comprehended him or not.

â€œA million and a half, at the very lowest. I know persons who have
offered one million seven hundred thousand francs, without being able to
persuade M. Fouquet to sell. Besides, supposing it were to happen that
M. Fouquet wished to sell, which I do not believe, in spite of what I
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI could not buy it just yet, since the superintendent will only sell
for ready money, and no one has a million and a half to put down at
NA
Colbert suddenly interrupted the counselor by an imperious gesture; he
had begun to meditate. Observing his superiorâ€™s serious attitude, and
his perseverance in continuing the conversation on this subject, Vanel
awaited the solution without venturing to precipitate it.
NA
â€œThe right of impeaching every French subject who is not a prince of
the blood; the right of quashing all proceedings taken against any
Frenchman, who is neither king nor prince. The procureur-general is the
kingâ€™s right hand to punish the guilty; the office is the means whereby
also he can evade the administration of justice. M. Fouquet, therefore,
would be able, by stirring up parliament, to maintain himself even
against the king; and the king could as easily, by humoring M. Fouquet,
get his edicts registered in spite of every opposition and objection.
The procureur-general can be made a very useful or a very dangerous

 he said.
â€œStay; you say that M. Gourville has spoken to you about M. Fouquetâ€™s

â€œThese were their very words: â€˜The parliament members are as proud as
they are wealthy; they ought to club together two or three millions

â€œNo; but M. Fouquet is our chief. He is in debt--is on the high road

out of charity to M. Fouquet, it could not be otherwise than most
humiliating to him; and he would be sure to refuse it. Let the

Chapter XLIII. An Interview with the Queen-Mother.
The queen-mother was in the bedroom at the Palais Royal, with Madame
de Motteville and Senora Molina. King Louis, who had been impatiently
expected the whole day, had not made his appearance; and the queen, who
was growing impatient, had often sent to inquire about him. The moral
atmosphere of the court seemed to indicate an approaching storm;
the courtiers and the ladies of the court avoided meeting in the
ante-chambers and the corridors in order not to converse on compromising
subjects. Monsieur had joined the king early in the morning for a
hunting-party; Madame remained in her own apartment, cool and distant
to every one; and the queen-mother, after she had said her prayers
in Latin, talked of domestic matters with her two friends in pure
Castilian. Madame de Motteville, who understood the language perfectly,
answered her in French. When the three ladies had exhausted every form
of dissimulation and of politeness, as a circuitous mode of expressing
that the kingâ€™s conduct was making the queen and the queen-mother pine
away through sheer grief and vexation, and when, in the most guarded
and polished phrases, they had fulminated every variety of imprecation
against Mademoiselle de la Valliere, the queen-mother terminated
her attack by an exclamation indicative of her own reflections and
NA
NA
terrible significance in the mouth of a queen who, like Anne of Austria,
hid many curious secrets in her soul.
NA
NA
NA
 She did not finish her phrase; for she fancied, when she raised her eyes
towards the full-length portrait of the pale Louis XIII., that light
once more flashed from her husbandâ€™s dull eyes, and his nostrils
grew livid with wrath. The portrait seemed animated by a living
expression--speak it did not, but it seemed to threaten. A profound
silence succeeded the queenâ€™s last remark. La Molina began to turn over
ribbons and laces on a large work-table. Madame de Motteville, surprised
at the look of mutual intelligence which had been exchanged between the
confidant and her mistress, cast down her eyes like a discreet woman,
and pretending to be observant of nothing that was passing, listened
with the utmost attention to every word. She heard nothing, however, but
NA
the incarnation of caution--and a profound sigh on that of the queen.
She looked up immediately.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œA very fine disorder, indeed! There is little good in M. Valot being

Madame de Motteville looked up with an air of great surprise, as she

NA

as if to justify her caution, a sharp, acute pain seized the queen,
who turned deadly pale, and threw herself back in the chair, with
every symptom of a sudden fainting fit. Molina ran to a richly gilded
tortoise-shell cabinet, from which she took a large rock-crystal bottle
of scented salts, and held it to the queenâ€™s nostrils, who inhaled it
wildly for a few minutes, and murmured:

The queen uttered a loud cry, buried her face in her hands, and seemed
utterly prostrated for some minutes; but whether from recollections
which arose in her mind, or from reflection, or even with sheer pain,
was doubtful. La Molina darted a look at Madame de Motteville, so full
of bitter reproach, that the poor woman, perfectly ignorant of
its meaning, was in her own exculpation on the point of asking an
explanation, when, suddenly, Anne of Austria arose and said, â€œYes, the
5th of September; my sorrow began on the 5th of September. The greatest

And, from that moment, Anne of Austria, whose memory and reason seemed
to be suspended for the time, remained impenetrable, with vacant look,
mind almost wandering, and hands hanging heavily down, as if life had
almost departed.

Madame de Motteville rose; large tears were rolling down the queenâ€™s
pallid face; and Molina, having observed this sign of weakness, fixed
her black vigilant eyes upon her.

revelations of the past, was about to be made, and that one person was

as if she had belonged to the Spanish court of the year 1620, opened

its tone, which proceeded from the other side of the tapestry hangings;
a voice which made the attendants start, and the queen tremble
excessively. At the same moment, a masked female appeared through the
hangings, and, before the queen could speak a syllable she added, â€œI
am connected with the order of the Beguines of Bruges, and do, indeed,
bring with me the remedy which is certain to effect a cure of your
NA
move a step.
NA
NA
Anne of Austria looked at her attendants, who immediately withdrew. The
Beguine, thereupon, advanced a few steps towards the queen, and bowed
reverently before her. The queen gazed with increasing mistrust at
this woman, who, in her turn, fixed a pair of brilliant eyes upon her,
through her mask.
NA
â€œif it is known at the Beguinage of Bruges that she stands in need of

â€œImpossible, madame, since your majestyâ€™s memory has not been awakened

Anne of Austria looked up, endeavoring to discover through the
mysterious mask, and this ambiguous language, the name of her companion,
who expressed herself with such familiarity and freedom; then, suddenly,
wearied by a curiosity which wounded every feeling of pride in her
nature, she said, â€œYou are ignorant, perhaps, that royal personages are

might have been able to administer some relief to your body and to your
mind, too; but since your majesty forbids me, I will take my leave.
NA
These words were uttered with a harmony of tone and respect of manner
that disarmed the queen of all anger and suspicion, but did not remove

those who are suffering to reject the means of relief Heaven sends them.

chest hears not, though he listens, the insatiable teeth of the disease
grinding onward through the muscles, and the blood flows freely on; the
knife has never been able to destroy, and rarely, even temporarily, to
disarm the rage of these mortal scourges,--their home is in the mind,
which they corrupt,--they gnaw the whole heart until it breaks. Such,

was acknowledged as the heir of the crown of France. The king then went
to the chapel of the old Chateau de Saint-Germain, to hear the _Te Deum_
NA
NA
â€œYour majestyâ€™s conferment took place in the presence of Monsieur, his
majestyâ€™s late uncle, of the princes, and of the ladies attached to
the court. The kingâ€™s physician, Bouvard, and Honore, the surgeon, were
stationed in the ante-chamber; your majesty slept from three oâ€™clock
NA
â€œYes, yes; but you tell me no more than every one else knows as well as

â€œI am now, madame, approaching that which very few persons are
acquainted with. Very few persons, did I say, alas! I might say two
only, for formerly there were but five in all, and, for many years
past, the secret has been well preserved by the deaths of the principal
participators in it. The late king sleeps now with his ancestors;
Perronnette, the midwife, soon followed him; Laporte is already

The queen opened her lips as though to reply; she felt, beneath her
icy hand, with which she kept her face half concealed, the beads of
perspiration on her brow.

supper, full of joy and happiness; around him on all sides arose wild
cries of delight and drinking of healths; the people cheered beneath
the balconies; the Swiss guards, the musketeers, and the royal guards
wandered through the city, borne about in triumph by the drunken
students. Those boisterous sounds of general joy disturbed the dauphin,
the future king of France, who was quietly lying in the arms of Madame
de Hausac, his nurse, and whose eyes, as he opened them, and stared
about, might have observed two crowns at the foot of his cradle.
Suddenly your majesty uttered a piercing cry, and Dame Perronnette
immediately flew to your bedside. The doctors were dining in a room at
some distance from your chamber; the palace, deserted from the frequency
of the irruptions made into it, was without either sentinels or guards.
The midwife, having questioned and examined your majesty, gave a sudden
exclamation as if in wild astonishment, and taking you in her arms,
bewildered almost out of her senses from sheer distress of mind,
dispatched Laporte to inform the king that her majesty the queen-mother
wished to see him in her room. Laporte, you are aware, madame, was a man
of the most admirable calmness and presence of mind. He did not approach
the king as if he were the bearer of alarming intelligence and wished
to inspire the terror he himself experienced; besides, it was not a
very terrifying intelligence which awaited the king. Therefore, Laporte
appeared with a smile upon his lips, and approached the kingâ€™s chair,
saying to him--â€˜Sire, the queen is very happy, and would be still more
so to see your majesty.â€™ On that day, Louis XIII. would have given
his crown away to the veriest beggar for a â€˜God bless you.â€™ Animated,
light-hearted, and full of gayety, the king rose from the table,
and said to those around him, in a tone that Henry IV. might have
adopted,--â€˜Gentlemen, I am going to see my wife.â€™ He came to your
beside, madame, at the very moment Dame Perronnette presented to him a
second prince, as beautiful and healthy as the former, and said--â€˜Sire,
Heaven will not allow the kingdom of France to fall into the female
line.â€™ The king, yielding to a first impulse, clasped the child in his

At this part of her recital, the Beguine paused, observing how intensely
the queen was suffering; she had thrown herself back in her chair, and
with her head bent forward and her eyes fixed, listened without seeming
to hear, and her lips moving convulsively, either breathing a prayer to
Heaven or imprecations on the woman standing before her.
â€œAh! I do not believe that, if, because there could be but one dauphin
NA
vegetate, banished from his royal parentsâ€™ presence, she was on that
account an unfeeling mother. Oh, no, no; there are those alive who have
known and witnessed the passionate kisses she imprinted on that innocent
creature in exchange for a life of misery and gloom to which state

perceived the effect which would result from the existence of two sons,
equal in age and pretensions, he trembled for the welfare of France,
for the tranquillity of the state; and it is equally well known that
Cardinal de Richelieu, by the direction of Louis XIII., thought over
the subject with deep attention, and after an hourâ€™s meditation in his
majestyâ€™s cabinet, he pronounced the following sentence:--â€˜One prince
means peace and safety for the state; two competitors, civil war and

not think that this secret terrifies me! You have obtained it, you shall

â€œYes, in the arms of his tutor, a poor, honest man, who did not long

â€œThat can easily be understood; it is so difficult to bear up under the
NA
irony of which reflection the queen pretended not to perceive. Madame
de Chevreuse continued: â€œWell, madame, I inquired some years ago at
Noisy-le-Sec about this unhappy child. I was told that it was not
believed he was dead, and that was my reason for not having at first
condoled with your majesty; for, most certainly, if I could have thought
it were true, never should I have made the slightest allusion to so
deplorable an event, and thus have re-awakened your majestyâ€™s most

â€œThey said, that one evening, about the year 1645, a lady, beautiful and
majestic in her bearing, which was observed notwithstanding the mask and

no doubt--came in a carriage to the place where the road branches off;
the very same spot, you know, where I awaited news of the young prince

â€œThat both the child and his tutor left that part of the country the

it was myself, Madame; this some one, some months after, passing through

recognized them, both living, cheerful, happy, and flourishing, the one
in a green old age, the other in the flower of his youth. Judge after
that what truth can be attributed to the rumors which are circulated, or
what faith, after that, placed in anything that may happen in the world!
But I am fatiguing your majesty; it was not my intention, however, to do
so, and I will take my leave of you, after renewing to you the assurance
NA
NA
â€œOf myself, madame! I am not worthy that you should bend your looks upon

anything from you.â€™ Heaven be praised! The misfortunes you speak of have
indeed worked a change in you, for you will now, perhaps, answer me, â€˜I

The duchesseâ€™s look and smile soon changed at this conclusion, and she
no longer attempted to act a false part.
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, then, your majesty can confer the greatest, the most ineffable

uneasiness of feeling produced by this remark. â€œBut do not forget, my
good Chevreuse, that I am quite as much under my sonâ€™s influence as I

murmuring to herself, â€œShe is a good-hearted woman, and very generous,

Dampierre into a state of repair. But when it is known that I require
that sum for the purpose of receiving your majesty at Dampierre

â€œa hundred thousand francs! you want a hundred thousand francs to put

â€œYou would be wrong if you did _not_. Besides, a hundred thousand francs

upon your silence and secrecy. Push that table a little towards me,
duchesse, and I will write you an order on M. Colbert; no, on M.

The queen wrote and handed the duchesse the order, and afterwards
dismissed her with a warm embrace.
Chapter XLV. How Jean de La Fontaine Came to Write His First Tale.
All these intrigues are exhausted; the human mind, so variously
complicated, has been enabled to develop itself at its ease in the three
outlines with which our recital has supplied it. It is not unlikely
that, in the future we are now preparing, a question of politics and
intrigues may still arise, but the springs by which they work will be
so carefully concealed that no one will be able to see aught but flowers
and paintings, just as at a theater, where a colossus appears upon the
scene, walking along moved by the small legs and slender arms of a child
concealed within the framework.
We now return to Saint-Mande, where the superintendent was in the habit
of receiving his select confederacy of epicureans. For some time past
the host had met with nothing but trouble. Every one in the house was
aware of and felt for the ministerâ€™s distress. No more magnificent or
recklessly improvident _reunions_. Money had been the pretext assigned
by Fouquet, and never _was_ any pretext, as Gourville said, more
fallacious, for there was not even a shadow of money to be seen.
M. Vatel was resolutely painstaking in keeping up the reputation of the
house, and yet the gardeners who supplied the kitchens complained of
ruinous delays. The agents for the supply of Spanish wines sent drafts
which no one honored; fishermen, whom the superintendent engaged on the
coast of Normandy, calculated that if they were paid all that was due to
them, the amount would enable them to retire comfortably for life; fish,
which, at a later period, was the cause of Vatelâ€™s death, did not arrive
at all. However, on the ordinary reception days, Fouquetâ€™s friends
flocked in more numerously than ever. Gourville and the Abbe Fouquet
talked over money matters--that is to say, the abbe borrowed a few
pistoles from Gourville; Pelisson, seated with his legs crossed, was
engaged in finishing the peroration of a speech with which Fouquet
was to open the parliament; and this speech was a masterpiece, because
Pelisson wrote it for his friend--that is to say, he inserted all kinds
of clever things the latter would most certainly never have taken the
trouble to say of his own accord. Presently Loret and La Fontaine would
enter from the garden, engaged in a dispute about the art of making
verses. The painters and musicians, in their turn, were hovering near
the dining-room. As soon as eight oâ€™clock struck the supper would be
announced, for the superintendent never kept any one waiting. It was
already half-past seven, and the appetites of the guests were beginning
to declare themselves in an emphatic manner. As soon as all the guests
were assembled, Gourville went straight up to Pelisson, awoke him out
of his reverie, and led him into the middle of a room, and closed the

Pelisson raised his intelligent and gentle face, and said: â€œI have
borrowed five and twenty thousand francs of my aunt, and I have them
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhat! absent-minded as usual! Why, it was you who told us the small
estate at Corbeli was going to be sold by one of M. Fouquetâ€™s creditors;
and you, also, who proposed that all his friends should subscribe--more
than that, it was you who said that you would sell a corner of your
house at Chateau-Thierry, in order to furnish your own proportion, and
NA
This remark was received with a general laugh, which made La Fontaine

NA
â€œThat is the truth, and the fact is, he is quite right, there is a great

astonishment, for he knew the poetâ€™s disinterestedness.

fresh bursts of laughter.

â€œOh! I upset the table over her and her guests; and then I got on my

Every one had great difficulty in keeping his countenance at the
exposure of this heroi-comedy, and when the laughter had subsided, one
of the guests present said to La Fontaine: â€œIs that all you have brought
NA
NA
NA
â€œHave you noticed that there is a good deal of sportive, jesting poetry
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThat may be; but a rare article is a dear article, and that is the
reason why I have written a small poem, excessively free in its style,
NA
NA
NA
NA
Peals of laughter again broke forth, while the poet was thus announcing
NA
everything that Boccaccio, Aretin, and other masters of their craft have
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
This wonderful conclusion again raised the mirth of all present.
â€œAnd I have sold the first edition of this little book for eight hundred

As he said this, he placed his offering in the hands of their treasurer;
it was then Loretâ€™s turn, who gave a hundred and fifty livres; the
others stripped themselves in the same way; and the total sum in the
purse amounted to forty thousand livres. The money was still being
counted over when the superintendent noiselessly entered the room;
he had heard everything; and then this man, who had possessed so many
millions, who had exhausted all the pleasures and honors the world had
to bestow, this generous heart, this inexhaustible brain, which had,
like two burning crucibles, devoured the material and moral substance of
the first kingdom in Europe, was seen to cross the threshold with tears
in his eyes, and pass his fingers through the gold and silver which the
bag contained.

will disappear into the smallest corner of my empty purse, but you have
filled to overflowing that which no one can ever exhaust, my heart.

embraced La Fontaine, saying to him, â€œPoor fellow! so you have, on my

only wait a couple of years, I shall have written a hundred other tales,

â€œBecause the hare will be the very one who will not be over pleased to

NA
NA
â€œThere was a tortoise, which was, as usual, well protected by its

â€œThe tortoise sold his shell and remained naked and defenseless. A
vulture happened to see him, and being hungry, broke the tortoiseâ€™s back
with a blow of his beak and devoured it. The moral is, that M. Fouquet

NA
said, to his adversary.

â€œAeschylus was bald-headed, and a vulture--your vulture, probably--who
was a great amateur in tortoises, mistook at a distance his head for a

him, walking about on the Place de la Bastile, at the very moment when I

me, embraced me, and took me to the inn called Lâ€™Image Saint-Fiacre, and

â€œâ€˜M. Fouquet, I know, has refused seventeen hundred thousand francs.â€™

from that moment fixed upon a fresh object in view.

La Fontaine set off at once, fortunately accompanied by Gourville,
for, absorbed in his own calculations, the poet would have mistaken
the route, and was hurrying as fast as he could towards the village
of Saint-Mande. Within a quarter of an hour afterwards, M. Vanel was
introduced into the superintendentâ€™s cabinet, a description of which has
already been given at the beginning of this story. When Fouquet saw him
enter, he called to Pelisson, and whispered a few words in his ear. â€œDo
not lose a single word of what I am going to say: let all the silver and
gold plate, together with my jewels of every description, be packed
up in the carriage. You will take the black horses: the jeweler
will accompany you; and you will postpone the supper until Madame de
NA

â€œNo; that will be useless; I will do that. So, away with you, my dear
NA
Pelisson set off, not quite clear as to his friendâ€™s meaning or
intention, but confident, like every true friend, in the judgment of the
man he was blindly obeying. It is that which constitutes the strength of
such men; distrust only arises in the minds of inferior natures.
Vanel bowed lowly to the superintendent, and was about to begin a
speech.
NA
NA
â€œIt is for you, monseigneur, to fix the amount you require. I know that
NA
â€œMadame Vanel, I have been told, values it at fourteen hundred thousand

NA

unpretending simplicity, amounting to greatness, of the man, for he had
expected disputes, difficulties, opposition of every kind.

NA
Fouquet was trifling with him.
â€œIf it were not for the trouble you would have in returning to Paris,
I would say at once; but we will arrange that the payment and the

to his head, for he was quite confounded by his success, said seriously
to the superintendent, â€œWill you give me your word, monseigneur, upon

NA
Vanel hesitated, trembled all over, and at last finished by hesitatingly
holding out his hand. Fouquet opened and nobly extended his own; this
loyal hand lay for a moment in Vanelâ€™s most hypocritical palm, and he
pressed it in his own, in order the better to convince himself of the
compact. The superintendent gently disengaged his hand, as he again

vestibule, and fled as quickly as he could.
Chapter XLVII. Madame de Belliereâ€™s Plate and Diamonds.
Fouquet had no sooner dismissed Vanel than he began to reflect for a few
moments--â€œA man never can do too much for the woman he has once loved.
Marguerite wishes to be the wife of a procureur-general--and why not
confer this pleasure upon her? And, now that the most scrupulous and
sensitive conscience will be unable to reproach me with anything, let
my thoughts be bestowed on her who has shown so much devotion for me.
NA
turned towards the secret door.
After he had locked himself in, he opened the subterranean passage, and
rapidly hastened towards the means of communicating between the house at
Vincennes and his own residence. He had neglected to apprise his friend
of his approach, by ringing the bell, perfectly assured that she would
never fail to be exact at the rendezvous; as, indeed, was the case, for
she was already waiting. The noise the superintendent made aroused her;
she ran to take from under the door the letter he had thrust there, and
NA
her heart filled with happiness Madame de Belliere ran to her carriage
in the Avenue de Vincennes, and in a few minutes she was holding out her
hand to Gourville, who was standing at the entrance, where, in order
the better to please his master, he had stationed himself to watch her
arrival. She had not observed that Fouquetâ€™s black horse arrived at the
same time, all steaming and foam-flaked, having returned to Saint-Mande
with Pelisson and the very jeweler to whom Madame de Belliere had sold
her plate and her jewels. Pelisson introduced the goldsmith into the
cabinet, which Fouquet had not yet left. The superintendent thanked him
for having been good enough to regard as a simple deposit in his hands,
the valuable property which he had every right to sell; and he cast his
eyes on the total of the account, which amounted to thirteen hundred
thousand francs. Then, going for a few moments to his desk, he wrote
an order for fourteen hundred thousand francs, payable at sight, at his
treasury, before twelve oâ€™clock the next day.

Fouquet let the worthy goldsmith pass out of the room by a secret door,
and then went to receive Madame de Belliere, who was already surrounded
by all the guests. The marquise was always beautiful, but now her

The crowd of guests hurried, more quickly than is usually the case
with ministerial entertainments, towards the banqueting-room, where
a magnificent spectacle presented itself. Upon the buffets, upon the
side-tables, upon the supper-table itself, in the midst of flowers and
light, glittered most dazzlingly the richest and most costly gold
and silver plate that could possibly be seen--relics of those ancient
magnificent productions the Florentine artists, whom the Medici family
patronized, sculptured, chased, and moulded for the purpose of holding
flowers, at a time when gold existed still in France. These hidden
marvels, which had been buried during the civil wars, timidly reappeared
during the intervals of that war of good taste called La Fronde; at a
time when noblemen fighting against nobleman killed, but did not pillage
each other. All the plate present had Madame de Belliereâ€™s arms engraved
NA
But the most remarkable object present was the cover which Fouquet had
assigned to the marquise. Near her was a pyramid of diamonds, sapphires,
emeralds, antique cameos, sardonyx stones, carved by the old Greeks of
Asia Minor, with mountings of Mysian gold; curious mosaics of ancient
Alexandria, set in silver; massive Egyptian bracelets lay heaped on
a large plate of Palissy ware, supported by a tripod of gilt bronze,
sculptured by Benvenuto Cellini. The marquise turned pale, as she
recognized what she had never expected to see again. A profound silence
fell on every one of the restless and excited guests. Fouquet did
not even make a sign in dismissal of the richly liveried servants who
crowded like bees round the huge buffets and other tables in the room.

to Madame de Belliere, who, having observed one of her friends in great
distress, sent all this gold and silver, together with the heap of
jewels now before her, to her goldsmith. This noble conduct of a devoted
friend can well be understood by such friends as you. Happy indeed is
that man who sees himself loved in such a manner. Let us drink to the

invariably impressed by beauty, â€œlet us also drink to the health of him

It was now the marquiseâ€™s turn. She rose, pale and smiling; and as she
held out her glass with a faltering hand, and her trembling fingers
touched those of Fouquet, her look, full of love, found its mirror in
that of her ardent and generous-hearted lover. Begun in this manner, the
supper soon became a _fete_; no one tried to be witty, but no one failed
in being so. La Fontaine forgot his Gorgny wine, and allowed Vatel to
reconcile him to the wines of the Rhone, and those from the shores of
Spain. The Abbe Fouquet became so kind and good-natured, that Gourville
said to him, â€œTake care, monsieur lâ€™abbe; if you are so tender, you will
NA
The hours passed away so joyously, that, contrary to his usual custom,
the superintendent did not leave the table before the end of the
dessert. He smiled upon his friends, delighted as a man is whose heart
becomes intoxicated before his head--and, for the first time, looked at
the clock. Suddenly a carriage rolled into the courtyard, and, strange
to say, it was heard high above the noise of the mirth which prevailed.
Fouquet listened attentively, and then turned his eyes towards the
ante-chamber. It seemed as if he could hear a step passing across it,
a step that, instead of pressing the ground, weighed heavily upon
NA
Aramisâ€™s grave and thoughtful face appeared upon the threshold of the
door, between the remains of two garlands, of which the flame of a lamp
had just burnt the thread that once united them.
Chapter XLVIII. M. de Mazarinâ€™s Receipt.
Fouquet would have uttered an exclamation of delight on seeing another
friend arrive, if the cold air and averted aspect of Aramis had not

asked. â€œAnd yet you would be frightened, perhaps, at the noise which our

NA
As he said this, he took the hand of Madame de Belliere, who looked at
him with a kind of uneasiness, and then led her to an adjoining _salon_,
after having recommended her to the most reasonable of his guests. And
then, taking Aramis by the arm, he led him towards his cabinet. As soon
as Aramis was there, throwing aside the respectful air he had assumed,
he threw himself into a chair, saying: â€œGuess whom I have seen this

â€œMy dear chevalier, every time you begin in that manner, I am sure to

â€œOh! pretexts are never wanting with _her_. Let me tell you what it is:
it seems that the duchesse has a good many letters of M. de Mazarinâ€™s in

â€œYes, a hundred, nay, a thousand times. Ever since I have been engaged
in public matters I have hardly heard of anything else. It is precisely
your own case, when, as a bishop, people reproach you for impiety; or,
as a musketeer, for your cowardice; the very thing of which they are
always accusing ministers of finance is the embezzlement of public
NA
â€œVery good; but take a particular instance, for the duchesse asserts
NA
NA
â€œSomething like a sum of thirteen millions of francs, of which it
would be very difficult for you to define the precise nature of the

the ceiling. â€œThirteen millions--I am trying to remember out of all

And as the superintendent looked into the drawer, Aramis rose from his
seat.

Fouquet took out the bundle of papers, and turned them over once more;
he then grew very pale.
NA
NA

any papers of mine of this nature; no one but myself ever opens this
drawer, of which, besides, no one, myself excepted, is aware of the

open drawers; he placed his hand on his shoulder, and in an affectionate
tone of voice, said: â€œDo not forget that the position of M. Fouquet can

Aramis, at this reply, became as livid as death; he pressed his hands
together convulsively, and with a wild, haggard look, which almost
annihilated Fouquet, he said, laying a stress on every distinct

Aramis looked as though he had been struck by lightning; the intelligent
and mocking expression of his countenance assumed an aspect of
such profound gloom and terror, that it had more effect upon the
superintendent than all the exclamations and speeches in the world. â€œYou

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Aramis replied to the almost stern look of the minister by a look full
NA
man of honor? As a soldier, I have risked my life five hundred times; as
a priest I have rendered still greater services, both to the state and
to my friends. The value of a word, once passed, is estimated according
to the worth of the man who gives it. So long as it is in his own
keeping, it is of the purest, finest gold; when his wish to keep it
has passed away, it is a two-edged sword. With that word, therefore, he
defends himself as with an honorable weapon, considering that, when he
disregards his word, he endangers his life and incurs an amount of risk
far greater than that which his adversary is likely to derive of profit.
NA
Fouquet bent down his head, as he replied, â€œI am a poor, self-determined
man, a true Breton born; my mind admires and fears yours. I do not say
that I keep my word from a proper feeling only; I keep it, if you like,
from custom, practice, pride, or what you will; but, at all events, the
ordinary run of men are simple enough to admire this custom of mine; it

â€œAnd so you are determined to sign the sale of the very appointment

Aramis sighed deeply, and looked all round him with the impatient
gesture of a man who would gladly dash something to pieces, as a relief

NA

NA
â€œI know nothing more loyal than the renunciation of your purchaser. Is

Fouquet held out his hand to him, and, at the very moment, a richly
ornamented tortoise-shell clock, supported by golden figures, which was
standing on a console table opposite to the fireplace, struck six. The
sound of a door being opened in the vestibule was heard, and Gourville
came to the door of the cabinet to inquire if Fouquet would received M.
Vanel. Fouquet turned his eyes from the gaze of Aramis, and then desired
that M. Vanel should be shown in.
Chapter XLIX. Monsieur Colbertâ€™s Rough Draft.
Vanel, who entered at this stage of the conversation, was nothing less
for Aramis and Fouquet than the full stop which completes a phrase.
But, for Vanel, Aramisâ€™s presence in Fouquetâ€™s cabinet had quite another
signification; and, therefore, at his first step into the room, he
paused as he looked at the delicate yet firm features of the bishop of
Vannes, and his look of astonishment soon became one of scrutinizing
attention. As for Fouquet, a perfect politician, that is to say,
complete master of himself, he had already, by the energy of his own
resolute will, contrived to remove from his face all traces of the
emotion which Aramisâ€™s revelation had occasioned. He was no longer,
therefore, a man overwhelmed by misfortune and reduced to resort to
expedients; he held his head proudly erect, and indicated by a gesture
that Vanel could enter. He was now the first minister of the state, and
in his own palace. Aramis knew the superintendent well; the delicacy of
the feelings of his heart and the exalted nature of his mind no longer
surprised him. He confined himself, then, for the moment--intending to
resume later an active part in the conversation--to the performance of
the difficult part of a man who looks on and listens, in order to learn
and understand. Vanel was visibly overcome, and advanced into the middle

NA

which Aramis had put the question; â€œbut in what way am I to address you,

NA
â€œCome, gentlemen, a truce to these ceremonies; let us proceed to the

â€œCome, now, tell me frankly, Monsieur Vanel, is not the affair rather a

NA
NA
â€œDo not make yourself uneasy on that score, Monsieur Vanel; I shall not
blame you for a failure in your word, which evidently may arise from

â€œOh, yes, monseigneur, you would blame me, and you would be right in

the superintendent; â€œfor a manâ€™s mind is variable, and full of these
very excusable caprices, which are, however, sometimes estimable enough;
and a man may have wished for something yesterday of which he repents
NA
NA
muttered.
Aramis, who was delighted to find the superintendent carry on the debate
with such clearness and precision, stood leaning his arm upon the marble
top of a console table and began to play with a small gold knife, with a
malachite handle. Fouquet did not hasten to reply; but after a momentâ€™s
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, well, that may be so; but to-day I ask you the favor to restore

â€œI received your _word_ as a satisfactory assurance that it would be

â€œI know that, and that is the reason why I now entreat you; do you

NA
which he did not immediately perceive, seemed almost to choke him as
he uttered it. Aramis, still playing with his knife, fixed a look upon
Vanel which seemed as if he wished to penetrate the recesses of his
heart. Vanel simply bowed, as he said, â€œI am overcome, monseigneur, at
the honor you do me to consult me upon a matter of business which is
NA
NA
NA
â€œI have brought the money with me,--the whole sum, I mean. And here,
monseigneur, is the contract of sale which I have just effected of
a property belonging to my wife. The order is authentic in every
particular, the necessary signatures have been attached to it, and it is
made payable at sight; it is ready money, in fact, and, in one word, the

â€œMy dear Monsieur Vanel, there is not a matter of business in this
world, however important it may be, which cannot be postponed in order
to oblige a man, who, by that means, might and would be made a devoted

NA
â€œAnd much more justly acquired would that friend become, Monsieur
Vanel, since the value of the service he had received would have been so
NA
Vanel preserved a perfect silence. In the meantime, Aramis had continued
his close observation of the man. Vanelâ€™s narrow face, his deeply sunken
eyes, his arched eyebrows, had revealed to the bishop of Vannes the type
of an avaricious and ambitious character. Aramisâ€™s method was to oppose
one passion by another. He saw that M. Fouquet was defeated--morally
subdued--and so he came to his rescue with fresh weapons in his hands.
NA
his own interests are diametrically opposed to this renunciation of the

Vanel looked at the bishop with astonishment; he had hardly expected to
find an auxiliary in him. Fouquet also paused to listen to the bishop.

wife; well, that is no slight matter; for one cannot displace, as he
has done, fourteen or fifteen hundred thousand francs without some
NA
NA
gaze, wrung from the bottom of his heart.
â€œInconveniences such as these are matters of great expense and
calculation, and whenever a man has money matters to deal with, the
NA
NA
Vanel remained perfectly silent; he, too, had understood him. Aramis
NA
himself, â€œyou are waiting, I see, until you know the amount; but do
not fear, I shall send you such a flight of crowns that you cannot but
NA
NA
Fouquet, carried away by his generous feelings.
The sum was a good one. A prince, even, would have been satisfied with
such a bonus. A hundred thousand crowns at that period was the dowry of
a kingâ€™s daughter. Vanel, however, did not move.

NA
accordingly.

superintendent. â€œThe price of ready money is enormous. You must have
made a great sacrifice in selling your wifeâ€™s property. Well, what can I

five hundred thousand francs; and even in that case I shall feel that I

There was not a gleam of delight or desire on Vanelâ€™s face, which
remained perfectly impassible; not a muscle of it changed in the
slightest degree. Aramis cast a look almost of despair at Fouquet, and
then, going straight up to Vanel and taking hold of him by the coat,
in a familiar manner, he said, â€œMonsieur Vanel, it is neither the
inconvenience, nor the displacement of your money, nor the sale of your
wifeâ€™s property even, that you are thinking of at this moment; it
is something more important still. I can well understand it; so pay
NA
NA
as the prelateâ€™s eyes seemed almost ready to devour him.
â€œI offer you, therefore, in the superintendentâ€™s name, not three hundred
thousand livres, nor five hundred thousand, but a million. A million--do

NA
â€œA million; in other words, at the present rate of interest, an income

NA
NA
NA
Aramis bit his lips, and something like a cloud seemed to pass over his
face. The thunder behind this cloud could easily be imagined. He still
kept his hold on Vanel. â€œYou have purchased the appointment for fifteen
hundred thousand francs, I think. Well, you will receive these fifteen
hundred thousand francs back again; by paying M. Fouquet a visit, and
shaking hands with him on the bargain, you will have become a gainer
of a million and a half. You get honor and profit at the same time,

have it about you, I suppose, in one of your pockets, already prepared,
NA
Vanel began to mutter something.
NA
Vanel tremblingly searched in his pockets, and as he drew out his
pocket-book, a paper fell out of it, while Vanel offered the other to
Fouquet. Aramis pounced upon the paper which had fallen out, as soon as
NA
NA
NA
than a lash of a whip; â€œand what I admire most is, that this draft is in

And he handed the draft to Fouquet, who recognized the truth of the
fact; for, covered with erasures, with inserted words, the margins
filled with additions, this deed--a living proof of Colbertâ€™s plot--had

Vanel, completely humiliated, seemed as if he were looking for some hole
wherein to hide himself.

should say to you, â€˜Repudiate it;â€™ such a proof as this absolves you

Fouquet pressed Aramisâ€™s hand; but, instead of the deed which Vanel
handed to him, he took the rough draft of it.

seized the paper, dashed down the money, and was about to make his
escape.

there? It ought to be counted over, Monsieur Vanel; particularly since
M. Colbert makes presents of money to ladies, I see. Ah, that worthy M.

word, every letter of the order to pay, distilled his wrath and his
contempt, drop by drop, upon the miserable wretch, who had to submit
to this torture for a quarter of an hour. He was then dismissed, not in
words, but by a gesture, as one dismisses or discharges a beggar or a
menial.
As soon as Vanel had gone, the minister and the prelate, their eyes
fixed on each other, remained silent for a few moments.
NA
man be compared, who, at the very moment he is on the point of entering
into a conflict with an enemy armed from head to foot, panting for his
life, presents himself for the contest utterly defenseless, throws down
his arms, and smiles and kisses his hands to his adversary in the most
gracious manner? Good faith, M. Fouquet, is a weapon which scoundrels
frequently make use of against men of honor, and it answers their
purpose. Men of honor, ought, in their turn, also, to make use of
dishonest means against such scoundrels. You would soon see how strong
NA
NA
Fouquet.
â€œFar from that; it would be merely coquetting or playing with the truth.
At all events, since you have finished with this Vanel; since you have
deprived yourself of the happiness of confounding him by repudiating
your word; and since you have given up, for the purpose of being used

Aramis smiled as he said, â€œPhilosophy--yes; teacher--yes; a drowning
child--yes; but a child can be saved--you shall see. But first of all

Fouquet looked at him with a bewildered air, â€œspeak to me about an idea
NA
NA
â€œA _fete_, I believe, to which the king invited himself of his own
NA
â€œNo, no, my dear prelate; a _fete_ to which M. Colbert advised the king
NA
â€œAh--exactly; as it would be a _fete_ of so costly a character that you
NA
â€œPrecisely so. In happier days, as I said just now, I had a kind of
pride in showing my enemies how inexhaustible my resources were; I felt
it a point of honor to strike them with amazement, by creating millions
under circumstances where they imagined nothing but bankruptcies and
failures would follow. But, at present, I am arranging my accounts with
the state, with the king, with myself; and I must now become a mean,
stingy man; I shall be able to prove to the world that I can act or
operate with my deniers as I used to do with my bags of pistoles, and
from to-morrow my equipages shall be sold, my mansions mortgaged, my

Chapter L: In Which the Author Thinks It Is High Time to Return to the
Vicomte de Bragelonne.
Our readers will have observed in this story, the adventures of the new
and of the past generation being detailed, as it were, side by side. He
will have noticed in the former, the reflection of the glory of earlier
years, the experience of the bitter things of this world; in the former,
also, that peace which takes possession of the heart, and that healing
of the scars which were formerly deep and painful wounds. In the latter,
the conflicts of love and vanity; bitter disappointments, ineffable
delights; life instead of memory. If, therefore, any variety has been
presented to the reader in the different episodes of this tale, it is
to be attributed to the numerous shades of color which are presented on
this double tablet, where two pictures are seen side by side, mingling
and harmonizing their severe and pleasing tones. The repose of
the emotions of one is found in harmonious contrast with the fiery
sentiments of the other. After having talked reason with older heads,
one loves to talk nonsense with youth. Therefore, if the threads of
the story do not seem very intimately to connect the chapter we are
now writing with the one we have just written, we do not intend to give
ourselves any more thought or trouble about it than Ruysdael took in
painting an autumn sky, after having finished a spring-time scene. We
accordingly resume Raoul de Bragelonneâ€™s story at the very place where
our last sketch left him.
In a state of frenzy and dismay, or rather without power or will of
his own,--hardly knowing what he was doing,--he fled swiftly, after the
scene in La Valliereâ€™s chamber, that strange exclusion, Louiseâ€™s grief,
Montalaisâ€™s terror, the kingâ€™s wrath--all seemed to indicate some
misfortune. But what? He had arrived from London because he had been
told of the existence of a danger; and almost on his arrival this
appearance of danger was manifest. Was not this sufficient for a lover?
Certainly it was, but it was insufficient for a pure and upright heart
such as his. And yet Raoul did not seek for explanations in the very
quarter where more jealous or less timid lovers would have done. He did
not go straightaway to his mistress, and say, â€œLouise, is it true
NA
courage, full of friendship as he was full of love; a religious observer
of his word, and believing blindly the word of others, Raoul said within
himself, â€œGuiche wrote to put me on my guard, Guiche knows something;
NA
 The journey was not a long one. Guiche, who had been brought from
Fontainebleau to Paris within the last two days, was beginning to
recover from his wounds, and to walk about a little in his room. He
uttered a cry of joy as he saw Raoul, with the eagerness of friendship,
enter the apartment. Raoul was unable to refrain from a cry of grief,
when he saw De Guiche, so pale, so thin, so melancholy. A very few
words, and a simple gesture which De Guiche made to put aside Raoulâ€™s
arm, were sufficient to inform the latter of the truth.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo; I am the happiest of men. My body suffers, but not my mind or my
NA
NA
NA
â€œIt is over. I have had enough happiness to last me to my dying day,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œMy dear friend, you would be wrong. I think, to ask me any
NA
NA
the nature of the evil, and the difficulty of remedying it.
NA
â€œCertainly. We will talk over that matter a little, when you have
NA
NA
â€œThank you; I have hurried, I have flown here; I came in half the time
the government couriers usually take. Now, tell me, my dear friend, what
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou cannot possibly have crushed all my hopes so violently, or have
exposed me to being disgraced by the king for my return, which is in
disobedience of his orders--you cannot, I say, have planted jealousy in
NA
â€œI do not say to you, Raoul, â€˜Be perfectly easy;â€™ but pray understand
NA
NA
NA
â€œIf you know anything, why conceal it from me? If you do not know
NA
â€œTrue, true, I was very wrong, and I regret having done so, Raoul. It
seems nothing to write to a friend and say â€˜Come;â€™ but to have this
friend face to face, to feel him tremble, and breathlessly and anxiously
NA
NA
despair.
â€œSee how unjust you are, and how soon you forget you have to do with a
poor wounded fellow such as your unhappy friend is. So, calm yourself,
NA
â€œYour object in telling me to come was your hope that I should see with
NA
NA
NA
â€œThere, now, you see you are not sure. But if you have any doubt, my
NA
â€œI saw Louise much agitated--Montalais in a state of bewilderment--the
NA
NA
â€œYes. You turn your head aside. The danger is there, the evil is there;
NA
NA
â€œOh! you say a thousand times more than nothing. Give me facts,
for pityâ€™s sake, give me proofs. My friend, the only friend I have,
speak--tell me all. My heart is crushed, wounded to death; I am dying
NA
NA
Guiche, â€œyou relieve me from my difficulty, and I will tell you all,
perfectly sure that I can tell you nothing but what is consoling,
NA
NA
â€œWell, then, I can only tell you what you might learn from every one you
NA
NA
â€œBefore you say people talk about it, learn what it is that people have
to talk about. I assure you solemnly, that people only talk about what
NA
NA
â€œYes, certainly, a walk with the king; and I believe the king has
already very frequently before taken walks with ladies, without on that
NA
â€œYou would not have written to me, shall I say again, if there had been

â€œI know that while the storm lasted, it would have been far better if
the king had taken shelter somewhere else, than to have remained with
his head uncovered before La Valliere; but the king is so very courteous

NA
NA
NA
â€œNo--I mean yes: there was the adventure of the oak, I think. But I know
NA
imitate him, notwithstanding his weakness. â€œWell, I will not add another
word: I have said either too much or not enough. Let others give you
further information if they will, or if they can; my duty was to warn
NA
â€œQuestion others! Alas! you are no true friend to speak to me in that
NA
may be either evilly disposed or a fool,--if the former, he will tell
me a lie to make me suffer more than I do now; if the latter, he will
do worse still. Ah! De Guiche, De Guiche, before two hours are over, I
shall have been told ten falsehoods, and shall have as many duels on my

â€œBut I know nothing, I tell you; I was wounded, attacked by fever: out
of my senses; and I have only a very faint recollection of it all. But
there is no reason why we should search very far, when the very man we
NA
NA
â€œGot to him, then. He will be able to throw sufficient light upon the
NA
De Guiche.
NA
â€œVery well. Will you excuse me, my dear Raoul? I am so proud since I
NA
â€œI would offer you my arm, De Guiche, if I did not guess that the person
NA
NA
Raoul remained motionless, absorbed in grief, overwhelmed, like the
miner upon whom a vault has just fallen in, who, wounded, his life-blood
welling fast, his thoughts confused, endeavors to recover himself, to
save his life and to retain his reason. A few minutes were all Raoul
needed to dissipate the bewildering sensations occasioned by these two
revelations. He had already recovered the thread of his ideas, when,
suddenly, through the door, he fancied he recognized Montalaisâ€™s voice
NA
voice! She will be able to tell me the whole truth; but shall I question
her here? She conceals herself even from me; she is coming, no doubt,
from Madame. I will see her in her own apartment. She will explain her
alarm, her flight, the strange manner in which I was driven out; she
will tell me all that--after M. dâ€™Artagnan, who knows everything, shall
have given me a fresh strength and courage. Madame, a coquette I fear,
and yet a coquette who is herself in love, has her moments of kindness;
a coquette who is as capricious and uncertain as life or death, but who
tells De Guiche that he is the happiest of men. He at least is lying on
NA
himself as he went for having talked of nothing but his own affairs to
De Guiche, and soon reached Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s quarters.
Chapter LI. Bragelonne Continues His Inquiries.
The captain, sitting buried in his leathern armchair, his spurs fixed in
the floor, his sword between his legs, was reading a number of letters,
as he twisted his mustache. Dâ€™Artagnan uttered a welcome full of

he seated himself, replied, â€œUpon my word I cannot tell you; all that I

Raoul was already pale enough; and he now began to turn his hat round
and round in his hand.

Dâ€™Artagnan increased the sharpness of his penetrating gaze, which no

said.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œDear captain, I know very well that in all trials of _finesse_, as well
as in all trials of strength, I shall be beaten by you. You can see that
at the present moment I am an idiot, an absolute noodle. I have neither
head nor arm; do not despise, but help me. In two words, I am the most

NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAh! if every one says so, there must be some truth in it. I begin to
believe there is fire when I see smoke. It is ridiculous, perhaps, but
NA
NA
â€œI never mix myself up in affairs of that kind; you know that very
NA
NA
â€œExactly. If you were a stranger, I should tell you--I will tell _you_
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œGood. Another big word. If you were really in love, my dear Raoul, you
NA
NA
â€œI mean that if you were really so deeply in love that I could believe I

NA
Dâ€™Artagnan could read to the very bottom of the young manâ€™s heart.
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo sensible man ever succeeded in making much of a brain when the head
was turned. I have completely lost my senses in the same way a hundred
times in my life. You would listen to me, but you would not hear me! you
would hear, but you would not understand me; you would understand, but
NA
NA
â€œI go far. Even if I were unfortunate enough to know something, and
NA
NA
â€œVery good. I should quarrel with you. You would never forgive me for
NA
â€œMonsieur dâ€™Artagnan, you know all; and yet you plunge me in perplexity
NA
NA
â€œI never complain, as you know; but as Heaven and my father would never
forgive me for blowing out my brains, I will go and get the first person
I meet to give me the information which you withhold; I will tell him he

â€œAnd you would kill him. And a fine affair that would be. So much the
better. What should I care? Kill any one you please, my boy, if it gives
you any pleasure. It is exactly like a man with a toothache, who keeps
on saying, â€˜Oh! what torture I am suffering. I could bite a piece of
iron in half.â€™ My answer always is, â€˜Bite, my friend, bite; the tooth
NA
NA
â€œYes, yes! you now assume a different tone: instead of killing, you will
get killed yourself, I suppose you mean? Very fine, indeed! How much
I should regret you! Of course I should go about all day, saying, â€˜Ah!
what a fine stupid fellow that Bragelonne was! as great a stupid as I
ever met with. I have passed my whole life almost in teaching him how
to hold and use his sword properly, and the silly fellow has got himself
spitted like a lark.â€™ Go, then, Raoul, go and get yourself disposed of,
if you like. I hardly know who can have taught you logic, but deuce take
NA
Raoul buried his face in his hands, murmuring: â€œNo, no; I have not a
NA
NA
NA
â€œIdle fancies, monsieur. I do not laugh at you, although I am a Gascon.
And, as for being indifferent, if I were so, I should have sent you
about your business a quarter of an hour ago, for you would make a man
who was out of his senses with delight as dull as possible, and would be
the death of one who was out of spirits. How now, young man! do you wish
me to disgust you with the girl you are attached to, and to teach you to
execrate the whole sex who constitute the honor and happiness of human
NA
NA
â€œDo you think, my dear fellow, that I can have crammed into my brain all
about the carpenter, and the painter, and the staircase, and a hundred

â€œI do not suppose it will concern you. But you ask me all sorts of
questions, and I answer you. You positively will learn all the scandal

Raoul struck his forehead with his hand in utter despair. â€œIt will kill

leave.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan, with a smile. â€œAh! a famous idea that! You wish to be
consoled by some one, and you will be so at once. She will tell you
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou allude to Montalais, I suppose--her friend; a woman who, on that
account, will exaggerate all that is either bad or good in the matter.
NA
NA
â€œWell, I admit it. And, in point of fact, why should I play with you as
a cat does with a poor mouse? You distress me, you do, indeed. And if I
wish you not to speak to Montalais just now, it is because you will be
betraying your secret, and people will take advantage of it. Wait, if
NA
NA
â€œSo much the worse. Why, you see, Raoul, if I had an idea,--but I have

â€œPromise me that you will pity me, my friend, that is all I need, and

â€œOh! yes, indeed, in order that you may get deeper into the mire! A
capital idea, truly! go and sit down at that table and take a pen in

Suddenly the door opened, and one of the musketeers, approaching
Dâ€™Artagnan, said, â€œCaptain, Mademoiselle de Montalais is here, and
NA
NA
NA
The cunning captain was quite right in his suspicions; for as soon as
Montalais entered she exclaimed, â€œOh, monsieur! monsieur! I beg your

NA
my age, those who are looking for me generally need me for something or

NA
â€œHow very fortunate that is; he was looking for you, too. Raoul, will

and then, taking hold of Montalaisâ€™s hand, he said, in a low voice, â€œBe

waiting for her at a little distance from the door, very much puzzled
and thoroughly uneasy at the dialogue, which promised no good augury for
him.

longer; be good enough to speak to me aloud of the rain, of the fine

Raoul clenched his hands, and tried to assume the look and gait of a
man of courage, it is true, but of a man of courage on his way to the
torture chamber. Montalais, glancing in every direction, walking along
with an easy swinging gait, and holding up her head pertly in the air,
preceded him to Madameâ€™s apartments, where he was at once introduced.

anything. Guiche showed too much consideration for my feelings; he had
no doubt come to an understanding with Madame, and both of them, by a
friendly plot, agreed to postpone the solution of the problem. Why
have I not a determined, inveterate enemy--that serpent, De Wardes, for
instance; that he would bite, is very likely; but I should not hesitate
NA
The next moment Raoul was in Madameâ€™s presence. Henrietta, more charming
than ever, was half lying, half reclining in her armchair, her small
feet upon an embroidered velvet cushion; she was playing with a kitten
with long silky fur, which was biting her fingers and hanging by the
lace of her collar.
Madame seemed plunged in deep thought, so deep, indeed, that it required
both Montalais and Raoulâ€™s voice to disturb her from her reverie.
NA
Madame shook her head as if she were just awakening, and then said,
â€œGood morning, Monsieur de Bragelonne; yes, I sent for you; so you have
NA
NA
NA
room.
â€œYou have a few minutes to give me, Monsieur de Bragelonne, have you
NA
NA
respect, guessing that there was something serious in these unusual
courtesies; nor was he displeased, indeed, to observe the seriousness
of her manner, feeling persuaded that there was some sort of affinity
between Madameâ€™s sentiments and his own. In fact, every one at court,
of any perception at all, knew perfectly well the capricious fancy and
absurd despotism of the princessâ€™s singular character. Madame had
been flattered beyond all bounds by the kingâ€™s attention; she had
made herself talked about; she had inspired the queen with that mortal
jealousy which is the stinging scorpion at the heel of every womanâ€™s
happiness; Madame, in a word, in her attempts to cure a wounded pride,
found that her heart had become deeply and passionately attached. We
know what Madame had done to recall Raoul, who had been sent out of
the way by Louis XIV. Raoul did not know of her letter to Charles II.,
although Dâ€™Artagnan had guessed its contents. Who will undertake to
account for that seemingly inexplicable mixture of love and vanity, that
passionate tenderness of feeling, that prodigious duplicity of conduct?
No one can, indeed; not even the bad angel who kindles the love of

NA
Bragelonne looked at Madame Henrietta, and seeing how pale she was, not
alone from what she was keeping back, but also from what she was burning
to say, said: â€œSatisfied! what is there for me to be satisfied or
NA
â€œBut what are those things with which a man of your age, and of your
NA
NA
NA
she might possibly be going to tell him, and wishing to put off the
opportunity of having everything explained, which he had hitherto so
ardently wished for, yet had dreaded so much, he replied: â€œI left,
Madame, a dear friend in good health, and on my return I find him very
NA
NA
imperturbable self-possession; â€œI _have_ heard he is a very dear friend
NA
NA
â€œWell, it is quite true he has been wounded; but he is better now.
NA
recovering herself, added, â€œBut has he anything to complain of? Has he
complained of anything? Is there any cause of grief or sorrow that we
NA
NA
â€œSo much the better, then, for, in other respects, M. de Guiche seems
to be very happy; he is always in very high spirits. I am sure that you,
Monsieur de Bragelonne, would far prefer to be, like him, wounded only

NA

NA
â€œYou did not say anything; you disapprove of my observation, then? you

generosity of disposition induce you to be careful and considerate as
to your manner of conveying it. Will your royal highness throw this kind

these words.
NA
NA
â€œYes, Madame, once your highness has deigned to begin, will you

Henrietta rose hurriedly and walked a few paces up and down her room.

Henrietta made a gesture full of impatience, as she said, â€œAt least, you

Raoul, whose head dropped like a blossom cut down by the reaper, made
an almost superhuman effort to smile, as he replied with the greatest
gentleness: â€œI have had the honor of telling your royal highness that

outcast, who has this moment arrived from England. There have rolled so
many stormy waves between myself and those I left behind me here, that

Henrietta was affected by his extreme pallor, his gentleness, and his
great courage. The principal feeling in her heart at that moment was an
eager desire to hear the nature of the remembrance which the poor lover
retained of the woman who had made him suffer so much. â€œMonsieur de

on this occasion. You hold your head high, as a man of honor should; and

Raoul stood with his head bent down.

Henrietta was for a moment struck with admiration at this sublime
disbelief: and then, shrugging her shoulders, she said, â€œYou do not
believe me, I see. How deeply you must love her. And you doubt if she

Chapter LIII. A Domiciliary Visit.
The princess, preceding Raoul, led him through the courtyard towards
that part of the building La Valliere inhabited, and, ascending the same
staircase which Raoul himself had ascended that very morning, she paused
at the door of the room in which the young man had been so strangely
received by Montalais. The opportunity was remarkably well chosen to
carry out the project Madame Henrietta had conceived, for the chateau
was empty. The king, the courtiers, and the ladies of the court, had
set off for Saint-Germain; Madame Henrietta was the only one who knew
of Bragelonneâ€™s return, and thinking over the advantages which might be
drawn from this return, she had feigned indisposition in order to remain
behind. Madame was therefore confident of finding La Valliereâ€™s room and
Saint-Aignanâ€™s apartment perfectly empty. She took a pass-key from
her pocket and opened the door of her maid of honorâ€™s apartment.
Bragelonneâ€™s gaze was immediately fixed upon the interior of the room,
which he recognized at once; and the impression which the sight of
it produced upon him was torture. The princess looked at him, and her
practiced eye at once detected what was passing in the young manâ€™s
heart.

Bragelonne obeyed, and then turned towards the princess, whom he
interrogated by a look.

â€œAh, true; I forgot to tell you. You know, perhaps, that formerly M. de

â€œYes, Madame, I am aware of that; that was the arrangement, at least,

â€œWell, he obtained the kingâ€™s leave to change his former convenient
and beautiful apartment for the two rooms to which this staircase will
conduct us, and which together form a lodging for him half the size, and
at ten times greater the distance from the king,--a close proximity to
whom is by no means disdained, in general, by the gentlemen belonging to

Saint-Aignanâ€™s rooms? Perhaps we shall be able to find the solution of

And Madame set the example by going down herself, while Raoul, sighing
deeply, followed her. At every step Bragelonne took, he advanced further
into that mysterious apartment which had witnessed La Valliereâ€™s sighs
and still retained the perfume of her presence. Bragelonne fancied he
perceived, as he inhaled the atmosphere, that the young girl must have
passed through. Then succeeded to these emanations of herself, which he
regarded as invisible though certain proofs, flowers she preferred to
all others--books of her own selection. If Raoul retained a single doubt
on the subject, it would have vanished at the secret harmony of tastes
and connection of the mind with the ordinary objects of life. La
Valliere, in Bragelonneâ€™s eyes, was present there in each article of
furniture, in the color of the hangings, in all that surrounded him.
Dumb, and now completely overwhelmed, there was nothing further for him
now to learn, and he followed his pitiless conductress as blindly as
the culprit follows the executioner; while Madame, as cruel as women of
overstrung temperaments generally are, did not spare him the slightest
detail. But it must be admitted that, notwithstanding the kind of apathy
into which he had fallen, none of these details, even had he been left
alone, would have escaped him. The happiness of the woman who loves,
when that happiness is derived from a rival, is a living torture for
a jealous man; but for a jealous man such as Raoul was, for one whose
heart for the first time in its existence was being steeped in gall and
bitterness, Louiseâ€™s happiness was in reality an ignominious death, a
death of body and soul. He guessed all; he fancied he could see them,
with their hands clasped in each otherâ€™s, their faces drawn close
together, and reflected, side by side, in loving proximity, and they
gazed upon the mirrors around them--so sweet an occupation for lovers,
who, as they thus see themselves twice over, imprint the picture still
more deeply on their memories. He could guess, too, the stolen kiss
snatched as they separated from each otherâ€™s loved society. The luxury,
the studied elegance, eloquent of the perfection of indolence, of
ease; the extreme care shown, either to spare the loved object every
annoyance, or to occasion her a delightful surprise; that might and
majesty of love multiplied by the majesty and might of royalty itself,
seemed like a death-blow to Raoul. If there be anything which can in any
way assuage or mitigate the tortures of jealousy, it is the inferiority
of the man who is preferred to yourself; whilst, on the very contrary,
if there be one anguish more bitter than another, a misery for which
language lacks a word, it is the superiority of the man preferred to
yourself, superior, perhaps, in youth, beauty, grace. It is in such
moments as these that Heaven almost seems to have taken part against the
disdained and rejected lover.
One final pang was reserved for poor Raoul. Madame Henrietta lifted up a
silk curtain, and behind the canvas he perceived La Valliereâ€™s portrait.
Not only the portrait of La Valliere, but of La Valliere radiant with
youth, beauty, and happiness, inhaling life and enjoyment at every pore,
because at eighteen years of age love itself is life.

NA
felt as if his heart were crushed within his bosom.
Madame Henrietta looked at him, almost envious of his extreme grief,
although she well knew there was nothing to envy in it, and that she
herself was as passionately loved by De Guiche as Louise by Bragelonne.
Raoul interpreted Madame Henriettaâ€™s look.
â€œOh, forgive me, forgive me, Madame; in your presence I know I ought to
have greater self-control. But Heaven grant that you may never be struck
by similar misery to that which crushes me at this moment, for you are
but a woman, and would not be able to endure so terrible an affliction.
Forgive me, I again entreat you, Madame; I am but a man without rank or
position, while you belong to a race whose happiness knows no bounds,
NA
NA
all the consideration and respect which a queenâ€™s heart even can bestow.
Regard me as your friend, monsieur; and as such, indeed, I would not
allow your whole life to be poisoned by perfidy, and covered with
ridicule. It was I, indeed, who, with more courage than any of your
pretended friends,--I except M. de Guiche,--was the cause of your return
from London; it is I, also, who now give you the melancholy proofs,
necessary, however, for your cure if you are a lover with courage in his

â€œI thank you, Madame; I appreciate the advice your royal highness is
good enough to give me, and I will endeavor to follow it; but one final

NA
â€œShould I be indiscreet in asking you the secret of this staircase, of
NA
â€œNothing more simple. For the purpose of exercising a surveillance over
the young girls who are attached to my service, I have duplicate keys of
their doors. It seemed very strange to me that M. de Saint-Aignan should
change his apartments. It seemed very strange that the king should
come to see M. de Saint-Aignan every day, and, finally, it seemed very
strange that so many things should be done during your absence, that the
very habits and customs of the court appeared changed. I do not wish
to be trifled with by the king, nor to serve as a cloak for his love
affairs; for after La Valliere, who weeps incessantly, he will take a
fancy to Montalais, who is always laughing; and then to Tonnay-Charente,
who does nothing but sing all day; to act such a part as that would be
unworthy of me. I thrust aside the scruples which my friendship for
you suggested. I discovered the secret. I have wounded your feelings, I
know, and I again entreat you to pardon me; but I had a duty to fulfil.
I have discharged it. You are now forewarned; the tempest will soon

Raoul drew out his tablet, and wrote rapidly on one of the leaves the
following words:
â€œMONSIEUR LE COMTE,--Do not be surprised to find this paper signed by
me; the friend I shall very shortly send to call on you will have the
honor to explain the object of my visit.
NA
He rolled up the paper, slipped it into the lock of the door which
communicated with the room set apart for the two lovers, and satisfied
himself that the missive was so apparent that Saint-Aignan could not but
see it as he entered; he rejoined the princess, who had already reached
the top of the staircase. They then separated, Raoul pretending to thank
her highness; Henrietta pitying, or seeming to pity, with all her heart,
the wretched young man she had just condemned to such fearful torture.

Chapter LIV. Porthosâ€™s Plan of Action.
The great number of individuals we have introduced into this long story
is the reason why each of them has been forced to appear only in turn,
according to the exigencies of the recital. The result is, that our
readers have had no opportunity of meeting our friend Porthos since his
return from Fontainebleau. The honors which he had received from
the king had not changed the easy, affectionate character of that
excellent-hearted man; he may, perhaps, have held up his head a little
higher than usual, and a majesty of demeanor, as it were, may have
betrayed itself since the honor of dining at the kingâ€™s table had been
accorded him. His majestyâ€™s banqueting-room had produced a certain
effect on Porthos. Le Seigneur de Bracieux et de Pierrefonds delighted
to remember that, during that memorable dinner, the numerous array of
servants, and the large number of officials in attendance on the guests,
gave a certain tone and effect to the repast, and seemed, as it were, to
furnish the room. Porthos undertook to confer upon Mouston a position of
some kind or other, in order to establish a sort of hierarchy among
his other domestics, and to create a military household, which was not
unusual among the great captains of the age, since, in the preceding
century, this luxury had been greatly encouraged by Messieurs de
Treville, de Schomberg, de la Vieuville, without alluding to M. de
Richelieu, M. de Conde, and de Bouillon-Turenne. And, therefore, why
should not he, Porthos, the friend of the king, and of M. Fouquet, a
baron, and engineer, etc., why should not he, indeed, enjoy all
the delightful privileges which large possessions and unusual merit
invariably confer? Somewhat neglected by Aramis, who, we know, was
greatly occupied with M. Fouquet; neglected, also, on account of his
being on duty, by Dâ€™Artagnan; tired of Truchen and Planchet, Porthos was
surprised to find himself dreaming, without precisely knowing why; but
NA
NA
which Porthos attempted to recall to his recollection all the details of
the royal banquet, gently joyful, thanks to the excellence of the wines;
gently melancholy, thanks to his ambitious ideas, Porthos was gradually
falling off into a placid doze, when his servant entered to announce
that M. de Bragelonne wished to speak to him. Porthos passed into an
adjoining room, where he found his young friend in the disposition of
mind we are already aware of. Raoul advanced towards Porthos, and
shook him by the hand; Porthos, surprised at his seriousness of aspect,
NA
NA
NA
Porthos; â€œI have eight thousand livres sent me this morning from
NA
NA
â€œSo much the worse, then. I have always heard it said that that is the
rarest service, but the easiest to render. The remark struck me; I like

â€œWell, if such excellent fish and meat were not to be procured there, it

â€œI am listening. Only just allow me to take a little sip. One gets

and, having first filled Raoulâ€™s glass, he filled his own, drank it down
at a gulp, and then resumed: â€œI needed that, in order to listen to you
with proper attention. I am now entirely at your service. What do you
NA
NA
NA
 replied Porthos, rubbing his forehead.
â€œI mean--you are generally good-humored, good-tempered, whenever any
misunderstanding arises between a friend of yours and a stranger, for
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhenever any friend of mine gets into a quarrel, I always act on one
NA
NA
â€œThat lost time is irreparable, and one never arranges an affair so well
as when everything has been done to embroil the disputants as much as
NA
NA
â€œPrecisely; so, as soon as a quarrel takes place, I bring the two

NA
â€œYou understand that by this means it is impossible for an affair not to

â€œI should have thought that, treated in this manner, an affair would, on

â€œOh! not the least in the world. Just fancy, now, I have had in my life
something like a hundred and eighty to a hundred and ninety regular

hundreds. It is very true he is a little too hard and sharp--I have
NA
NA
NA
â€œThere is not a single instance in which I have not finished by
NA
confidence that surprised Raoul.
NA
â€œOh! rely upon that; and at this stage, I will explain my other
principle to you. As soon as my friend has intrusted his quarrel to
me, this is what I do; I go to his adversary at once, armed with
a politeness and self-possession absolutely requisite under such
NA
NA
NA
â€œI believe you. I go to the adversary, then, and say to him: â€˜It is
impossible, monsieur, that you are ignorant of the extent to which you
NA
NA
friend has not been insulted at all; he has even been the first to give
offense; you can imagine, therefore, whether my language is or is not
NA
NA
laughter was resounding in his ears, â€œI am very unfortunate. De Guiche
treats me with coolness, Dâ€™Artagnan with ridicule, Porthos is too tame;
no one will settle this affair in the only way I wish it to be settled.
And I came to Porthos because I wanted to find a sword instead of cold
NA
Porthos, who had recovered himself, continued: â€œBy one simple
NA
NA
â€œNot at all, it is quite certain. I have not left him an excuse; and
then it is that I display all my courtesy, in order to attain the
happy issue of my project. I advance, therefore, with an air of great
politeness, and taking my adversary by the hand, I say to him: â€˜Now
that you are convinced of having given the offense, we are sure of
reparation; between my friend and yourself, the future can only offer an
exchange of mutual courtesies of conduct, and consequently, my mission

your agreeable society; I will take you with me; we can call upon your

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell! if he is waiting, it is merely to stretch his legs a little. The
adversary, on the contrary, is stiff from riding; they place themselves
in proper order, and my friend kills the opponent, and the affair is

adding gesture to speech, lifted Raoul and the chair he was sitting on
off the ground, and carried them round the room.
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo, my dear M. du Vallon, the usage of the present day requires that

NA
NA
â€œDeuce take it! how troublesome all this is! In former days we had no
occasion to say anything about the matter. People fought for the sake of

â€œIt is too long a story to tell; only, as one must particularize to
a certain extent, and as, on the other hand, the affair is full of
difficulties, and requires the most absolute secrecy, you will have the
kindness merely to tell M. de Saint-Aignan that he has, in the first

NA
NA
NA

fellow mean by getting trap-doors made without first consulting you?
Trap-doors! _mordioux!_ I havenâ€™t got any, except in my dungeons at

in France and Spain to cut each otherâ€™s throats, and that is saying but

â€œNo, nor Dâ€™Artagnan either. He is very cautious, you know, and might

Raoul left the room, saying to himself, with a secret delight,
â€œPerfidious king! traitorous monarch! I cannot reach thee. I do not wish
it; for kings are sacred objects. But your friend, your accomplice, your
panderer--the coward who represents you--shall pay for your crime. I

Chapter LV. The Change of Residence, the Trap-Door, and the Portrait.
Porthos, intrusted, to his great delight, with this mission, which made
him feel young again, took half an hour less than his usual time to put
on his court suit. To show that he was a man acquainted with the usages
of high society, he had begun by sending his lackey to inquire if
Monsieur de Saint-Aignan were at home, and heard, in answer, that M.
le Comte de Saint-Aignan had had the honor of accompanying the king to
Saint-Germain, as well as the whole court; but that monsieur le comte
had just that moment returned. Immediately upon this reply, Porthos made
as much haste as possible, and reached Saint-Aignanâ€™s apartments just
as the latter was having his boots taken off. The promenade had been
delightful. The king, who was in love more than ever, and of course
happier than ever, behaved in the most charming manner to every one.
Nothing could possibly equal his kindness. M. de Saint-Aignan, it may
be remembered, was a poet, and fancied that he had proved that he was
so under too many a memorable circumstance to allow the title to be
disputed by any one. An indefatigable rhymester, he had, during
the whole of the journey, overwhelmed with quatrains, sextains, and
madrigals, first the king, and then La Valliere. The king, on his side,
was in a similarly poetical mood, and had made a distich; while La
Valliere, delighting in poetry, as most women do who are in love, had
composed two sonnets. The day, then, had not been a bad one for Apollo;
and so, as soon as he had returned to Paris, Saint-Aignan, who knew
beforehand that his verse would be sure to be extensively circulated in
court circles, occupied himself, with a little more attention than he
had been able to bestow during the promenade, with the composition, as
well as with the idea itself. Consequently, with all the tenderness of
a father about to start his children in life, he candidly interrogated
himself whether the public would find these offsprings of his
imagination sufficiently elegant and graceful; and in order to make
his mind easy on the subject, M. de Saint-Aignan recited to himself the
madrigal he had composed, and which he had repeated from memory to the
king, and had promised to write out for him on his return. All the
time he was committing these words to memory, the comte was engaged in
undressing himself more completely. He had just taken off his coat, and
was putting on his dressing-gown, when he was informed that Monsieur le
Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds was waiting to be received.
NA
NA

NA
Porthos, in a few minutes, entered the room. M. de Saint-Aignan had
an excellent recollection of persons, and, at the first glance, he
recognized the gentleman from the country, who enjoyed so singular
a reputation, and whom the king had received so favorably at
Fontainebleau, in spite of the smiles of some of those who were present.
He therefore advanced towards Porthos with all the outward signs of
consideration of manner which Porthos thought but natural, considering
that he himself, whenever he called upon an adversary, hoisted a
standard of the most refined politeness. Saint-Aignan desired the
servant to give Porthos a chair; and the latter, who saw nothing unusual
in this act of politeness, sat down gravely and coughed. The ordinary
courtesies having been exchanged between the two gentlemen, the comte,
to whom the visit was paid, said, â€œMay I ask, monsieur le baron, to what
NA
â€œThe very thing I am about to have the honor of explaining to you,
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œIt is the fact, though, monsieur le comte; I have broken it--so much
so, indeed, that if I do not move, I shall fall down, which would be an
exceedingly disagreeable position for me in the discharge of the very

Porthos rose; and but just in time, for the chair had given way several
inches. Saint-Aignan looked about him for something more solid for his
guest to sit upon.

looking about, â€œare constructed in a ridiculously flimsy manner. In my
early days, when I used to sit down with far more energy than is now the
case, I do not remember ever to have broken a chair, except in taverns,

weight, â€œthat unfortunately has nothing whatever to do with my present
NA
â€œWhy unfortunately? Are you the bearer of a message of ill-omen,
NA
NA
 replied Porthos, nobly. â€œI have simply come to say that you have
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
assure you, monsieur, that it is quite impossible; for M. de Bragelonne,
whom I know but very slightly,--nay, whom I know hardly at all--is in
England, and, as I have not seen him for a long time past, I cannot

perfectly unmoved; â€œand I repeat, it is quite certain you have insulted
him, since he himself told me you had. Yes, monsieur, you have seriously

â€œSpeak the truth before this gentleman--the truth, you understand. I

NA
NA
NA

Saint-Aignan dismissed the valet, and followed him to the door, in order
to close it after him; and when he had done so, looking straight before
him, he happened to see in the keyhole of the adjoining apartment the

 he said.

thought. Porthos left him to his reflections; but after a while returned
to the mission he had undertaken.
NA
Saint-Aignan after a brief pause.
â€œI think I can now understand it, from this note, which has arrived here
in so singular a manner. Monsieur de Bragelonne says that a friend will

as his conduct is concerned, if it be mysterious, as you say, you have

amount of confidence which, for a man who was unaccustomed to his ways,
must have revealed an infinity of sense.
NA
Saint-Aignan.
NA
NA
â€œOh, I perfectly understand. We will touch very lightly upon it, then,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAdmit it! of course I admit it. Why should I not admit it, do you

NA
â€œBut how can my having moved my lodgings have done M. de Bragelonne
any harm? Have the goodness to tell me that, for I positively do not

Porthos stopped him, and then said, with great gravity, â€œMonsieur, this

â€œAh, the next! You will observe, monsieur, that the one I have already
mentioned is a most serious injury, to which you have given no answer,
or rather, have answered very indifferently. Is it possible, monsieur,
that you have changed your lodgings? M. de Bragelonne feels insulted at
NA
NA
coolness of his visitor--â€œwhat! am I to consult M. de Bragelonne whether
NA
â€œI am. And it is absolutely necessary, monsieur; but under any
circumstances, you will admit that it is nothing in comparison with the

NA
Porthos assumed a very solemn expression as he said: â€œHow about the
NA
Saint-Aignan turned exceedingly pale. He pushed back his chair so
abruptly, that Porthos, simple as he was, perceived that the blow had
NA
NA
head.
Saint-Aignan held down his head, as he murmured: â€œI have been betrayed,
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œA guilty conscience, monsieur. Your affair is a bad one, and when the
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
penetrated the secret, he must be aware of the danger he as well as
NA
â€œM. de Bragelonne runs no danger, monsieur, nor does he fear any either,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
made the comteâ€™s blood freeze in his veins.
As the portrait in question was La Valliereâ€™s portrait, and no mistake
could any longer exist on the subject, Saint-Aignanâ€™s eyes were

NA
Porthos assumed an imposing air, all the majesty of ignorance, in fact,
as he said: â€œIt matters nothing whatever to me, nor to yourself, indeed,
whether or not my friend was, as you say, engaged to be married. I am
even astonished that you should have made use of so indiscreet a remark.
NA
NA
intelligence, delicacy, and loyalty of feeling united. I see the whole
NA
NA
NA
ingenious and the most delicate manner possible. I beg you to accept my

NA
Porthos shook his head, as a man who does not wish to hear, but
Saint-Aignan continued: â€œI am in despair, I assure you, at all that
has happened; but how would you have acted in my place? Come, between

Porthos drew himself up as he answered: â€œThere is now no question at
all of what I should have done, young man; you have been made acquainted
NA
â€œAs for the first, my change of rooms, and I now address myself to you
as a man of honor and of great intelligence, could I, when the desire
of so august a personage was so urgently expressed that I should move,
NA
Porthos was about to speak, but Saint-Aignan did not give him time to
NA
NA
Porthos did not reply, and so Saint-Aignan continued: â€œI pass by that
NA
â€œthat trap-door, the occasion and means of so much unhappiness, and
which was constructed for--you know what. Well, then, in plain truth, do
you suppose that it was I who, of my own accord, in such a place, too,
had that trap-door made?--Oh, no!--you do not believe it; and here,
again, you feel, you guess, you understand the influence of a will
superior to my own. You can conceive the infatuation, the blind,
irresistible passion which has been at work. But, thank Heaven! I am
fortunate in speaking to a man who has so much sensitiveness of feeling;
and if it were not so, indeed, what an amount of misery and scandal
NA
Porthos, confused and bewildered by the eloquence and gestures of
Saint-Aignan, made a thousand efforts to stem this torrent of words,
of which, by the by, he did not understand a single one; he remained
upright and motionless on his seat, and that was all he could do.
Saint-Aignan continued, and gave a new inflection to his voice, and an
increasing vehemence to his gesture: â€œAs for the portrait, for I readily
believe the portrait is the principal cause of complaint, tell me
candidly if you think me to blame?--Who was it who wished to have her
portrait? Was it I?--Who is in love with her? Is it I?--Who wishes to
gain her affection? Again, is it I?--Who took her likeness? I, do you
think? No! a thousand times no! I know M. de Bragelonne must be in a
state of despair; I know these misfortunes are most cruel. But I, too,
am suffering as well; and yet there is no possibility of offering any
resistance. Suppose we were to fight? we would be laughed at. If he
obstinately persist in his course, he is lost. You will tell me, I know,
that despair is ridiculous, but then you are a sensible man. You have
understood me. I perceived by your serious, thoughtful, embarrassed
air, even, that the importance of the situation we are placed in has
not escaped you. Return, therefore, to M. de Bragelonne; thank him--as I
have indeed reason to thank him--for having chosen as an intermediary a
man of your high merit. Believe me that I shall, on my side, preserve
an eternal gratitude for the man who has so ingeniously, so cleverly
arranged the misunderstanding between us. And since ill luck would have
it that the secret should be known to four instead of three, why,
this secret, which might make the most ambitious manâ€™s fortune, I am
delighted to share with you, monsieur, from the bottom of my heart I
am delighted at it. From this very moment you can make use of me as you
please, I place myself entirely at your mercy. What can I possibly do
for you? What can I solicit, nay, require even? You have only to speak,
NA
And, according to the familiarly friendly fashion of that period,
Saint-Aignan threw his arms round Porthos, and clasped him tenderly
in his embrace. Porthos allowed him to do this with the most perfect
NA
NA
NA
NA
curiosity.
NA
â€œAh! he wishes to speak to me, I suppose? I can well believe that; he
wishes to have the details, very likely; alas! it is a very delicate
matter; but at the present moment I cannot, for the king is waiting for

NA
NA
courtier, with a smile of utter amazement, for he could not understand
that the king could under any circumstances be supposed to have to wait.
NA
NA
NA
â€œAh, indeed! but are we going to laugh over the affair when we get
NA
NA
utter hardness.
â€œBut the Minimes is a rendezvous where duels take place, and what can I

Porthos slowly drew his sword, and said: â€œThat is the length of my

NA
The color mounted to Porthosâ€™s face, as he replied: â€œIf I had not the
honor of being in your own apartment, monsieur, and of representing M.
de Bragelonneâ€™s interests, I would throw you out of the window. It will
be merely a pleasure postponed, and you will lose nothing by waiting.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
And saluting Saint-Aignan with his usual courtesy, Porthos left the
room, delighted at having arranged another affair. Saint-Aignan looked
after him as he left; and then hastily putting on his court dress
again, he ran off, arranging his costume as he went along, muttering to
himself, â€œThe Minimes! the Minimes! We shall see how the king will fancy

Chapter LVI. Rivals in Politics.
On his return from the promenade, which had been so prolific in poetical
effusions, and in which every one had paid his or her tribute to the
Muses, as the poets of the period used to say, the king found M. Fouquet
waiting for an audience. M. Colbert had lain in wait for his majesty in
the corridor, and followed him like a jealous and watchful shadow;
M. Colbert, with his square head, his vulgar and untidy, though rich
costume, somewhat resembled a Flemish gentleman after he had been
over-indulging in his national drink--beer. Fouquet, at sight of his
enemy, remained perfectly unmoved, and during the whole of the scene
which followed scrupulously resolved to observe a line of conduct
particularly difficult to the man of superior mind, who does not even
wish to show his contempt, for fear of doing his adversary too much
honor. Colbert made no attempt to conceal his insolent expression of the
vulgar joy he felt. In his opinion, M. Fouquetâ€™s was a game very badly
played and hopelessly lost, although not yet finished. Colbert belonged
to that school of politicians who think cleverness alone worthy of
their admiration, and success the only thing worth caring for. Colbert,
moreover, who was not simply an envious and jealous man, but who had the
kingâ€™s interest really at heart, because he was thoroughly imbued with
the highest sense of probity in all matters of figures and accounts,
could well afford to assign as a pretext for his conduct, that in hating
and doing his utmost to ruin M. Fouquet, he had nothing in view but the
welfare of the state and the dignity of the crown. None of these details
escaped Fouquetâ€™s observation; through his enemyâ€™s thick, bushy brows,
and despite the restless movement of his eyelids, he could, by merely
looking at his eyes, penetrate to the very bottom of Colbertâ€™s heart,
and he read to what an unbounded extent hate towards himself and triumph
at his approaching fall existed there. But as, in observing everything,
he wished to remain himself impenetrable, he composed his features,
smiled with the charmingly sympathetic smile that was peculiarly his
own, and saluted the king with the most dignified and graceful ease and
NA
NA
â€œMost gratified, indeed, monsieur le surintendant, most gratified. You

NA
seem to take the trouble to turn aside his head in merest respect of
Colbertâ€™s presence.

NA
â€œYour majesty gratifies my utmost wishes in speaking in that manner, for

 said Colbert, endeavoring to show his importance by taking part in the
conversation.
Fouquet, with the profoundest contempt, did not take the slightest
notice of the remark, as if, as far as he was concerned, Colbert had not
even thought or said a word.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAnd I have come now, sire, to inform your majesty that I am ready to

â€œWonders? Oh! no, sire. I do not undertake that. I hope to be able
to procure your majesty a little pleasure, perhaps even a little

NA
â€˜wonders.â€™ You are a magician, I believe; we all know the power you
wield; we also know that you can find gold even when there is none to be

Fouquet felt that the shot was discharged from a double quiver, and
that the king had launched an arrow from his own bow as well as one from

Louis paused quite confused. He wished to look at Colbert; Colbert, too,
wished to reply to him; a glance as swift as an eagleâ€™s, a king-like
glance, indeed, which Fouquet darted at the latter, arrested the
words upon his lips. The king, who had by this time recovered his
self-possession, turned towards Fouquet, saying, â€œI presume, therefore,
NA
â€œYes, sire, if your majesty will condescend so far as to accept my
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou speak like an enchanter who has but to conjure up in actuality
the wildest fancies, Monsieur Fouquet. I could not say so much, indeed,
NA
â€œYour majesty will do, whenever you please, everything that a monarch
can and ought to do. The king of France has servants at his bidding
who are able to do anything on his behalf, to accomplish everything to

Colbert tried to look at the superintendent, in order to see whether
this remark was an approach to less hostile sentiments on his part; but
Fouquet had not even looked at his enemy, and Colbert hardly seemed
NA
NA
NA
â€œThis is Tuesday; if I give you until next Sunday week, will that be
NA
â€œThe delay which your majesty deigns to accord me will greatly aid the
various works which my architects have in hand for the purpose of adding
NA
NA
NA
â€œThe king is master everywhere, sire; your majesty will draw up your own
list and give your own orders. All those you may deign to invite will be
NA
NA
in so noble a tone.
Fouquet, therefore, took leave of Louis XIV., after a few words had been
added with regard to the details of certain matters of business. He felt
that Colbert would remain behind with the king, that they would both
converse about him, and that neither of them would spare him in the
least degree. The satisfaction of being able to give a last and
terrible blow to his enemy seemed to him almost like a compensation
for everything they were about to subject him to. He turned back again
immediately, as soon, indeed, as he had reached the door, and addressing
the king, said, â€œI was forgetting that I had to crave your majestyâ€™s
NA
NA
NA
â€œA fault! You! Ah! Monsieur Fouquet, I shall be unable to do otherwise
than forgive you. In what way or against whom have you been found
NA
â€œAgainst every sense of propriety, sire. I forgot to inform your majesty
NA
NA
Colbert trembled; he fancied that he was about to frame a denunciation
against him. His conduct had been unmasked. A single syllable from
Fouquet, a single proof formally advanced, and before the youthful
loyalty of feeling which guided Louis XIV., Colbertâ€™s favor would
disappear at once; the latter trembled, therefore, lest so daring a blow
might overthrow his whole scaffold; in point of fact, the opportunity
was so admirably suited to be taken advantage of, that a skillful,
NA
Fouquet, with an easy, unconcerned air, â€œsince you have had the kindness
to forgive me, I am perfectly indifferent about my confession; this
NA
NA
Colbert turned perfectly livid. â€œThat which conferred upon me, sire,
a grand gown, and a stern air of gravity; the appointment of

The king involuntarily uttered a loud exclamation and looked at Colbert,
who, with his face bedewed with perspiration, felt almost on the point
NA
 inquired the king.
Colbert was obliged to lean against a column of the fireplace. â€œTo a
NA
NA
NA
Fouquet; letting every word fall from his lips with the most inimitable
nonchalance, and with an admirably assumed expression of forgetfulness
and ignorance. And having finished, and having overwhelmed Colbert
beneath the weight of this superiority, the superintendent again saluted
the king and quitted the room, partially revenged by the stupefaction of
the king and the humiliation of the favorite.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Colbert this time did not reply; he had penetrated the kingâ€™s thought,
a thought which amply revenged him for the humiliation he had just been
made to suffer; his hatred was augmented by a feeling of bitter jealousy
of Fouquet; and a threat of disgrace was now added to the plan he had
arranged for his ruin. Colbert felt perfectly assured that for the
future, between Louis XIV. and himself, their hostile feelings and ideas
would meet with no obstacles, and that at the first fault committed by
Fouquet, which could be laid hold of as a pretext, the chastisement
so long impending would be precipitated. Fouquet had thrown aside his
weapons of defense, and hate and jealousy had picked them up. Colbert
was invited by the king to the _fete_ at Vaux; he bowed like a man
confident in himself, and accepted the invitation with the air of
one who almost confers a favor. The king was about writing down
Saint-Aignanâ€™s name on his list of royal commands, when the usher
NA
 entered, Colbert discreetly withdrew.
Chapter LVII. Rivals in Love.
Saint-Aignan had quitted Louis XIV. hardly a couple of hours before; but
in the first effervescence of his affection, whenever Louis XIV. was out
of sight of La Valliere, he was obliged to talk about her. Besides,
the only person with whom he could speak about her at his ease was
Saint-Aignan, and thus Saint-Aignan had become an indispensable.

â€œâ€˜Nothing more than that,â€™ do you say? It is very diverting to find
you treating it with so much disdain. Are you who express such an
indifference on the subject, aware, that as soon as it is known that M.
Fouquet is going to receive me at Vaux next Sunday week, people will
be striving their very utmost to get invited to the _fete?_ I repeat,
NA
â€œVery well, sire; unless I shall, in the meantime, have undertaken a

NA
NA
NA
NA
a way, in truth, that I hardly know what to say, or how to act, in order

â€œVery well; if your majesty will deign to listen to me, I will not keep

admirable companion at table; for, I think, you are referring to the

â€œPrecisely so; but you have omitted to add to his other qualifications,

â€œOf course; answer me as candidly as if it were some one elseâ€™s affair

The king remained silent and thoughtful for a few moments, and then
NA
NA
king probed his friend to the bottom of his heart to ascertain if he
had learned the secret of his flirtation with his sister-in-law. But
Saint-Aignan was not an ordinary courtier; he did not lightly run the
risk of finding out family secrets; and he was too a friend of the Muses
not to think very frequently of poor Ovidius Naso, whose eyes shed so
many tears in expiation of his crime for having once beheld something,
one hardly knows what, in the palace of Augustus. He therefore passed
by Madameâ€™s secret very skillfully. But as he had shown no ordinary
sagacity in indicating Madameâ€™s presence in his rooms in company with
Bragelonne, it was necessary, of course, for him to repay with interest
the kingâ€™s _amour propre_, and reply plainly to the question which had

â€œAh! I beg your pardon, then, sire; but I thought the Comte de Guiche

â€œBesides, I wish to have the whole of this affair explained; I wish to
know how it is that I have been so insolently trifled with, as to have
the sanctuary of my affections pried into. It is not you, Saint-Aignan,
whose business it is to punish those who have acted in this manner, for

â€œI implore your majesty not to overwhelm M. de Bragelonne with your
wrath, for although in the whole of this affair he may have shown
himself deficient in prudence, he has not been so in his feelings of

The king had hardly pronounced these words, which betokened that a fresh
feeling of irritation was mingling with the recollections of old, when
NA
 inquired the king, â€œand why do you presume to come when I have not

NA

NA
NA
The king and Saint-Aignan at this reply exchanged a look which betrayed
more uneasiness than surprise. Louis hesitated for a moment, but
immediately afterwards, seeming to make up his mind, he said:
â€œGo, Saint-Aignan, and find Louise; inform her of the plot against us;
do not let her be ignorant that Madame will return to her system of
persecutions against her, and that she has set those to work who would

NA
â€œIf Louise gets nervous and frightened, reassure her as much as you can;
tell her that the kingâ€™s affection is an impenetrable shield over her;

the king, trembling with passion, â€œtell her, I say, that this time,
instead of defending her, I will avenge her, and that too so terribly

â€œYes, all. Go as quickly as you can, and remain faithful; for, you who
live in the midst of this stake of infernal torments, have not, like

Saint-Aignan exhausted himself in protestations of devotion, took the
kingâ€™s hand, kissed it, and left the room radiant with delight.
Chapter LVIII. King and Noble.
The king endeavored to recover his self-possession as quickly as
possible, in order to meet M. de la Fere with an untroubled countenance.
He clearly saw it was not mere chance that had induced the comteâ€™s
visit, he had some vague impression of its importance; but he felt
that to a man of Athosâ€™s tone of mind, to one of such a high order of
intellect, his first reception ought not to present anything either
disagreeable or otherwise than kind and courteous. As soon as the king
had satisfied himself that, as far as appearances went, he was perfectly
calm again, he gave directions to the ushers to introduce the comte. A
few minutes afterwards Athos, in full court dress, and with his breast
covered with the orders that he alone had the right to wear at the court
of France, presented himself with so grave and solemn an air that the
king perceived, at the first glance, that he was not deceived in his
anticipations. Louis advanced a step towards the comte, and, with a
smile, held out his hand to him, over which Athos bowed with the air of
the deepest respect.

Athos bowed and replied, â€œI should wish always to enjoy the happiness of

The tone, however, in which this reply was conveyed, evidently
signified, â€œI should wish to be one of your majestyâ€™s advisers, to save

position.

almost bound from his seat.

Chapter LIX. After the Storm.
Our readers will doubtlessly have been asking themselves how it happened
that Athos, of whom not a word has been said for some time past, arrived
so very opportunely at court. We will, without delay, endeavor to
satisfy their curiosity.
Porthos, faithful to his duty as an arranger of affairs, had,
immediately after leaving the Palais Royal, set off to join Raoul at the
Minimes in the Bois de Vincennes, and had related everything, even to
the smallest details, which had passed between Saint-Aignan and himself.
He finished by saying that the message which the king had sent to his
favorite would probably not occasion more than a short delay, and that
Saint-Aignan, as soon as he could leave the king, would not lose a
moment in accepting the invitation Raoul had sent him.
But Raoul, less credulous than his old friend, had concluded from
Porthosâ€™s recital that if Saint-Aignan was going to the king,
Saint-Aignan would tell the king everything, and that the king would
most assuredly forbid Saint-Aignan to obey the summons he had received
to the hostile meeting. The consequence of his reflections was, that he
had left Porthos to remain at the place appointed for the meeting, in
the very improbable case that Saint-Aignan would come there; having
endeavored to make Porthos promise that he would not remain there
more than an hour or an hour and a half at the very longest. Porthos,
however, formally refused to do anything of the kind, but, on the
contrary, installed himself in the Minimes as if he were going to
take root there, making Raoul promise that when he had been to see his
father, he would return to his own apartments, in order that Porthosâ€™s
servant might know where to find him in case M. de Saint-Aignan should
happen to come to the rendezvous.
Bragelonne had left Vincennes, and proceeded at once straight to the
apartments of Athos, who had been in Paris during the last two days, the
comte having been already informed of what had taken place, by a letter
from Dâ€™Artagnan. Raoul arrived at his fatherâ€™s; Athos, after having held
out his hand to him, and embraced him most affectionately, made a sign
for him to sit down.
â€œI know you come to me as a man would go to a friend, vicomte, whenever
NA
The young man bowed, and began his recital; more than once in the course
of it his tears almost choked his utterance, and a sob, checked in his
throat, compelled him to suspend his narrative for a few minutes. Athos
most probably already knew how matters stood, as we have just now
said Dâ€™Artagnan had already written to him; but, preserving until the
conclusion that calm, unruffled composure of manner which constituted
the almost superhuman side of his character, he replied, â€œRaoul, I do
not believe there is a word of truth in these rumors; I do not believe
in the existence of what you fear, although I do not deny that persons
best entitled to the fullest credit have already conversed with me on
the subject. In my heart and soul I think it utterly impossible that the
king could be guilty of such an outrage on a gentleman. I will answer
for the king, therefore, and will soon bring you back the proof of what

Raoul, wavering like a drunken man between what he had seen with his own
eyes and the imperturbable faith he had in a man who had never told a
falsehood, bowed and simply answered, â€œGo, then, monsieur le comte; I
NA
Athos dressed, and then left him, in order to wait upon the king; the
result of that interview is already known to our readers.
When he returned to his lodgings, Raoul, pale and dejected, had not
quitted his attitude of despair. At the sound, however, of the opening
doors, and of his fatherâ€™s footsteps as he approached him, the young man
raised his head. Athosâ€™s face was very pale, his head uncovered, and
his manner full of seriousness; he gave his cloak and hat to the lackey,
dismissed him with a gesture, and sat down near Raoul.

NA
â€œI told him, Raoul, that everything was now at an end between him and
ourselves; that you would never serve him again. I told him that I, too,
should remain aloof. Nothing further remains for me, then, but to be

â€œWith reference to your disappointed affection, and--your ideas of

â€œOh, monsieur, with regard to my affection, I shall, perhaps, some day
or other, succeed in tearing it from my heart; I trust I shall do so,
aided by Heavenâ€™s merciful help, and your own wise exhortations. As
far as vengeance is concerned, it occurred to me only when under the
influence of an evil thought, for I could not revenge myself upon the
one who is actually guilty; I have, therefore, already renounced every

NA
â€œNo, monsieur; I sent him a challenge: if M. de Saint-Aignan accepts it,
I will maintain it; if he does not take it up, I will leave things as

NA
â€œYou cannot, I know, have seriously thought that I should dream of

a tear started even to the eyes of his father, who had so many times
in the course of his life bowed beneath his own sorrows and those of
others.
He held out his hand to Raoul, which the latter seized most eagerly.
â€œAnd so, monsieur le comte, you are quite satisfied that the misfortune
NA
NA
NA
it is indeed horrible suffering for me to despise, as I am bound to
do, the one I have loved so devotedly. If I had but some real cause of
complaint against her, I should be happy, I should be able to forgive
NA
Athos looked at his son with a profoundly sorrowful air, for the words
Raoul had just pronounced seemed to have issued out of his own heart. At
this moment the servant announced M. dâ€™Artagnan. This name sounded very
differently to the ears of Athos and Raoul. The musketeer entered the
room with a vague smile on his lips. Raoul paused. Athos walked towards
his friend with an expression of face that did not escape Bragelonne.
Dâ€™Artagnan answered Athosâ€™s look by an imperceptible movement of the
eyelid; and then, advancing towards Raoul, whom he took by the hand, he
said, addressing both father and son, â€œWell, you are trying to console
NA
â€œAnd you, kind and good as usual, have come to help me in my difficult
NA
As he said this, Athos pressed Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s hand between both his own.
Raoul fancied he observed in this pressure something beyond the sense
his mere words conveyed.
NA
NA
â€œYou are most welcome, chevalier; not for the consolation you bring with
NA
he attempted to smile, but the effort was more sad than any tears
Dâ€™Artagnan had ever seen shed.
NA
NA
to give me the details of his interview with the king. You will allow
NA
the musketeer, he seemed to read the very depths of his heart.
NA
unassumed that there was no means of suspecting that his astonishment
NA
NA
â€œAh, indeed; you were unaware, then, that the comte had seen his
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
and affection you have for me, I was afraid you might possibly have
expressed somewhat plainly to his majesty my own sufferings and your
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œFor a moment, and I cannot help confessing it, I trembled lest you had
NA
NA
in which an exact observer might perhaps have wished to have heard a
little more frankness.
NA
NA
â€œTell me, monsieur, for the advice is sure to be good, as it comes from
NA
â€œVery good, then; I advise you, after your long journey from England,
after your visit to M. de Guiche, after your visit to Madame, after your
visit to Porthos, after your journey to Vincennes, I advise you, I say,
to take a few hoursâ€™ rest; go and lie down, sleep for a dozen hours, and
when you wake up, go and ride one of my horses until you have tired him
NA
And drawing Raoul towards him, he embraced him as he would have done his
own child. Athos did the like; only it was very visible that the kiss
was still more affectionate, and the pressure of his lips even warmer
with the father than with the friend. The young man again looked at both
his companions, endeavoring to penetrate their real meaning or their
real feelings with the utmost strength of his intelligence; but his look
was powerless upon the smiling countenance of the musketeer or upon
the calm and composed features of the Comte de la Fere. â€œWhere are you
NA
to go out.
NA
â€œWe shall be sure to find you there, then, if we should have anything to
NA
â€œYes, monsieur; but do you suppose it likely you will have something to
NA
NA
NA
towards the door.
Raoul, observing the perfect composure which marked every gesture of his
two friends, quitted the comteâ€™s room, carrying away with him nothing
but the individual feeling of his own particular distress.
NA
NA
And wrapping himself up in his cloak, in order to conceal from the
passers-by in the streets his gloomy and sorrowful face, he quitted
them, for the purpose of returning to his own rooms, as he had promised
Porthos. The two friends watched the young man as he walked away with
a feeling of genuine disinterested pity; only each expressed it in a
different way.
NA
NA
Chapter LX. Heu! Miser!
NA
in point of fact, to be pitied by both these men, Raoul must indeed have
been most unhappy. And therefore, when he found himself alone, face to
face, as it were, with his own troubles, leaving behind him the intrepid
friend and the indulgent father; when he recalled the avowal of the
kingâ€™s affection, which had robbed him of Louise de la Valliere, whom
he loved so deeply, he felt his heart almost breaking, as indeed we all
have at least once in our lives, at the first illusion destroyed, the
NA
is now left me in this world. Nothing to look forward to, nothing to
hope for. Guiche has told me so, my father has told me so, M. dâ€™Artagnan
has told me so. All life is but an idle dream. The future which I have
been hopelessly pursuing for the last ten years is a dream! the union of
hearts, a dream! a life of love and happiness, a dream! Poor fool that
NA
publicly, and in the face of others, friends and enemies--and for what
purpose, too? in order that my friends may be saddened by my troubles,
and my enemies may laugh at my sorrows. And so my unhappiness will soon
become a notorious disgrace, a public scandal; and who knows but that
NA
And, despite the composure which he had promised his father and
Dâ€™Artagnan to observe, Raoul could not resist uttering a few words of
NA
if I had the pliancy of character and strength of will of M. dâ€™Artagnan,
I should laugh, with my lips at least; I should convince other women
that this perfidious girl, honored by the affection I have wasted on
her, leaves me only one regret, that of having been abused and deceived
by her seemingly modest and irreproachable conduct; a few might perhaps
fawn on the king by jesting at my expense; I should put myself on
the track of some of those buffoons; I should chastise a few of them,
perhaps; the men would fear me, and by the time I had laid three dying
or dead at my feet, I should be adored by the women. Yes, yes, that,
indeed, would be the proper course to adopt, and the Comte de la Fere
himself would not object to it. Has not he also been tried, in his
earlier days, in the same manner as I have just been tried myself? Did
he not replace affection by intoxication? He has often told me so. Why
should I not replace love by pleasure? He must have suffered as much as
I suffer, even more--if that is possible. The history of one man is the
history of all, a dragging trial, more or less prolonged, more or less
bitter--sorrowful. The note of human nature is nothing but one sustained
cry. But what are the sufferings of others compared to those from which
I am now suffering? Does the open wound in anotherâ€™s breast soften the
anguish of the gaping ulcer in our own? Does the blood which is welling
from another manâ€™s side stanch that which is pouring from our own? Does
the general grief of our fellow-creatures lessen our own private and
particular woe? No, no, each suffers on his own account, each struggles
NA
â€œwhat has my life been up to the present moment? A cold, barren, sterile
arena, in which I have always fought for others, never for myself.
Sometimes for a king, sometimes for a woman. The king has betrayed, the
woman disdained me. Miserable, unlucky wretch that I am! Women! Can I
not make all expiate the crime of one of their sex? What does that
need? To have a heart no longer, or to forget that I ever had one; to
be strong, even against weakness itself; to lean always, even when
one feels that the support is giving way. What is needed to attain, or
succeed in all that? To be young, handsome, strong, valiant, rich. I
NA
honor after all? A theory which every man understands in his own way. My
father tells me: â€˜Honor is the consideration of what is due to others,
and particularly what is due to oneself.â€™ But Guiche, and Manicamp,
and Saint-Aignan particularly, would say to me: â€˜Whatâ€™s honor? Honor
consists in studying and yielding to the passions and pleasures of oneâ€™s
king.â€™ Honor such as that indeed, is easy and productive enough. With
honor like that, I can keep my post at the court, become a gentleman of
the chamber, and accept the command of a regiment, which may at any time
be presented to me. With honor such as that, I can be duke and peer.
â€œThe stain which that woman has stamped upon me, the grief that has
broken my heart, the heart of the friend and playmate of her childhood,
in no way affects M. de Bragelonne, an excellent officer, a courageous
leader, who will cover himself with glory at the first encounter, and
who will become a hundred times greater than Mademoiselle de la Valliere
is to-day, the mistress of the king--for the king will not marry
her--and the more publicly he will proclaim her as his mistress, the
more opaque will grow the shadow of shame he casts upon her face, in the
guise of a crown; and in proportion as others despise, as I despise her,
I shall be gleaning honors in the field. Alas! we had walked together
side by side, she and I, during the earliest, the brightest, the most
angelic portion of our existence, hand in hand along the charming path
of life, covered with the blossoms of youth; and then, alas! we reach
a cross-road, where she separates herself from me, in which we have
to follow a different route, whereby we become more and more widely
separated from each other. And to attain the end of this path, oh,
Heaven! I am now alone, in utter despair, and crushed to the very
NA
Such were the sinister reflections in which Raoul indulged, when his
foot mechanically paused at the door of his own dwelling. He had reached
it without remarking the streets through which he passed, without
knowing how he had come; he pushed open the door, continued to advance,
and ascended the staircase. The staircase, as in most of the houses at
that period, was very dark, and the landings most obscure. Raoul lived
on the first floor; he paused in order to ring. Olivain appeared, took
his sword and cloak from his hands; Raoul himself opened the door which,
from the ante-chamber, led into a small _salon_, richly furnished enough
for the _salon_ of a young man, and completely filled with flowers by
Olivain, who, knowing his masterâ€™s tastes, had shown himself studiously
attentive in gratifying them, without caring whether his master
perceived his attention or not. There was a portrait of La Valliere in
the _salon_, which had been drawn by herself and given by her to Raoul.
This portrait, fastened above a large easy chair covered with dark
colored damask, was the first point towards which Raoul bent his
steps--the first object on which he fixed his eyes. It was, moreover,
Raoulâ€™s usual habit to do so; every time he entered his room, this
portrait, before anything else, attracted his attention. This time, as
usual, he walked straight up to the portrait, placed his knees upon the
arm chair, and paused to look at it sadly. His arms were crossed upon
his breast, his head slightly thrown back, his eyes filled with tears,
his mouth worked into a bitter smile. He looked at the portrait of
the one he had so tenderly loved; and then all that he had said passed
before his mind again, all that he had suffered seemed again to assail
his heart; and, after a long silence, he murmured for the third time,
NA
He had hardly pronounced these words, when he heard the sound of a sigh
and a groan behind him. He turned sharply round and perceived, in the
angle of the _salon_, standing up, a bending veiled female figure, which
he had been the means of concealing behind the door as he opened it,
and which he had not perceived as he entered. He advanced towards the
figure, whose presence in his room had not been announced to him; and
as he bowed, and inquired at the same moment who she was, she suddenly
raised her head, and removed the veil from her face, revealing her pale
and sorrow-stricken features. Raoul staggered back as if he had seen a
ghost.
NA
have thought the human voice was capable of so desponding a cry, without
the snapping of the human heart.
Chapter LXI. Wounds within Wounds.
Mademoiselle de la Valliere--for it was indeed she--advanced a few steps
NA
But this interval, short as it had been, was quite sufficient for Raoul
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
as Raoul did not attempt to interrupt her, a momentâ€™s silence ensued,
during which the sound of their throbbing hearts might have been heard,
not in unison with each other, but the one beating as violently as the
other. It was for Louise to speak, and she made an effort to do so.
NA
I should see you--myself--alone. I have not hesitated to adopt a step
which must remain secret; for no one, except yourself, could understand
NA
NA
emotion, â€œas far as I am concerned, and despite the good opinion you

Louise, interrupting him with her soft, sweet voice.
Bragelonne looked at her for a moment; then mournfully shaking his head,
NA
She cast a glance all round her. This look was a timid entreaty, and
implored secrecy far more effectually than her expressed words had
done a few minutes before. Raoul rouse, and went to the door, which he

NA
Nothing could have produced a greater effect upon Louise than these few
words, which seemed to signify, â€œYou see that I still understand

rebellious tear which she could not restrain; and then, having collected
herself for a moment, she said, â€œRaoul, do not turn your kind, frank
look away from me. You are not one of those men who despise a woman
for having given her heart to another, even though her affection might

NA
one, and I cannot tell in what way to begin. It will be better for me,
I think, to relate to you, very simply, everything that has befallen me.
As I shall speak but the pure and simple truth, I shall always find my
path clear before me in spite of the obscurity and obstacles I have to
brave in order to solace my heart, which is full to overflowing, and

Raoul continued to preserve the same unbroken silence. La Valliere
looked at him with an air that seemed to say, â€œEncourage me; for pityâ€™s

passed across his lips.

I have told you all--wait until I have said to you all that I had to

Raoul, by the strength of his iron will, forced his features to assume a
calmer expression, and the disdainful smile upon his lip passed away.
NA
hands raised in entreaty towards you, with my forehead bowed to the
ground before you, I entreat you, as the most generous, as the noblest
of men, to pardon, to forgive me. If I have left you in ignorance
of what was passing in my own bosom, never, at least, would I have
consented to deceive you. Oh! I entreat you, Raoul--I implore you on my
knees--answer me one word, even though you wrong me in doing so. Better,
far better, an injurious word from your lips, than suspicion resting in
NA
NA
an effort to remain calm. â€œTo leave another in ignorance that you are
deceiving him, is loyal; but to deceive him--it seems that would be very

â€œMonsieur, for a long time I thought that I loved you better than
anything else; and so long as I believed in my affection for you, I told
you that loved you. I could have sworn it on the altar; but a day came

you, true loyalty of conduct should have forced you to inform me you had

â€œBut on that day, Raoul--on that day, when I read in the depths of my
own heart, when I confessed to myself that you no longer filled my mind
entirely, when I saw another future before me than that of being your
friend, your life-long companion, your wife--on that day, Raoul, you

NA
â€œRaoul, I did not dare to do so. Raoul, I have been weak and cowardly.
I knew you so thoroughly--I knew how devotedly you loved me, that I
trembled at the bare idea of the grief I was about to cause you; and
that is so true, Raoul, that this very moment I am now speaking to you,
bending thus before you, my heart crushed in my bosom, my voice full of
sighs, my eyes full of tears, it is so perfectly true, that I have no
other defense than my frankness, I have no other sorrow greater than

Raoul attempted to smile.
NA
not do me so foul a wrong as to disguise your feelings before me now!
You loved me; you were sure of your affection for me; you did not

upon her knees.

NA
NA
that other--oh! for Heavenâ€™s sake let me say it, Raoul, for it is my
only excuse--that other I love better than my own life, better than my
own soul even. Forgive my fault, or punish my treason, Raoul. I came
here in no way to defend myself, but merely to say to you: â€˜You know
what it is to love!â€™--in such a case am I! I love to that degree, that
I would give my life, my very soul, to the man I love. If he should ever
cease to love me, I shall die of grief and despair, unless Heaven come
to my assistance, unless Heaven does show pity upon me. Raoul, I came
here to submit myself to your will, whatever it might be--to die, if it
were your wish I should die. Kill me, then, Raoul! if in your heart you

in your life; I, too, who have been wrong, for, in deceiving myself, I

enlightened you. I ought not to have relied upon uncertainty; I ought to
have extracted an answer from your heart, whilst I hardly even sought an

suffered myself to be torn to pieces for your sake, have sacrificed my
very future for you. I love you so deeply, Louise, that my heart feels
dead and crushed within me,--my faith in human nature all is gone,--my
eyes have lost their light; I loved you so deeply, that I now no longer

she was on the point of crying out in bitter agony at this remark, he
placed his hand on her mouth to stifle the exclamation. She pressed her

â€œtake this young lady and bear her to the carriage which is waiting for
NA
to dart towards La Valliere, in order to give her a first and last kiss,
but, stopping abruptly, he said, â€œNo! she is not mine. I am no thief--as

carried La Valliere, still fainting, to the carriage.
Chapter LXII. What Raoul Had Guessed.
As soon as Raoul had quitted Athos and Dâ€™Artagnan, as the two
exclamations that had followed his departure escaped their lips, they
found themselves face to face alone. Athos immediately resumed the
earnest air that he had assumed at Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s arrival.
NA
NA
NA
Athos, smiling.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI have plenty of time. Are you not curious, besides, to know how things
NA
â€œIf you will be good enough to tell me, I will listen with the greatest
NA
which the latter threw himself, assuming the easiest possible attitude.
NA
conversation is rather curious, I must say. In the first place the king
NA
NA
â€œYou were just going down the last steps of the staircase, as the
musketeers told me. I arrived. My dear Athos, he was not red in the face
merely, he was positively purple. I was not aware, of course, of what
had passed; only, on the ground, lying on the floor, I saw a sword
NA
â€œâ€˜Captain dâ€™Artagnan,â€™ cried the king, as soon as he saw me.
â€œâ€˜Sire,â€™ I replied.
â€œâ€˜M. de la Fere has just left me; he is an insolent man.â€™
â€œâ€˜An insolent man!â€™ I exclaimed, in such a tone that the king stopped
suddenly short.
â€œâ€˜Captain dâ€™Artagnan,â€™ resumed the king, with his teeth clenched, â€˜you
will be good enough to listen to and hear me.â€™
â€œâ€˜That is my duty, sire.â€™
â€œâ€˜I have, out of consideration for M. de la Fere, wished to spare
him--he is a man of whom I still retain some kind recollections--the
discredit of being arrested in my palace. You will therefore take a
carriage.â€™ At this I made a slight movement.
â€œâ€˜If you object to arrest him yourself,â€™ continued the king, â€˜send me my
captain of the guards.â€™
â€œâ€˜Sire,â€™ I replied, â€˜there is no necessity for the captain of the
guards, since I am on duty.â€™
â€œâ€˜I should not like to annoy you,â€™ said the king, kindly, â€˜for you have
always served me well, Monsieur Dâ€™Artagnan.â€™
NA
â€œâ€˜But,â€™ said the king, in astonishment, â€˜I believe the comte is your
friend?â€™
â€œâ€˜If he were my father, sire, it would not make me less on duty than I
am.â€™
â€œThe king looked at me; he saw how unmoved my face was, and seemed
satisfied. â€˜You will arrest M. le Comte de la Fere, then?â€™ he inquired.
â€œâ€˜Most certainly, sire, if you give me the order to do so.â€™
â€œâ€˜Very well; I order you to do so.â€™
â€œI bowed, and replied, â€˜Where is the comte, sire?â€™
â€œâ€˜You will look for him.â€™
â€œâ€˜And am I to arrest him, wherever he may be?â€™
â€œâ€˜Yes; but try that he may be at his own house. If he should have
started for his own estate, leave Paris at once, and arrest him on his
way thither.â€™
â€œI bowed; but as I did not move, he said, â€˜Well, what are you waiting
for?â€™
â€œâ€˜For the order to arrest the comte, signed by yourself.â€™
â€œThe king seemed annoyed; for, in point of fact, it was the exercise of
a fresh act of authority, a repetition of the arbitrary act, if, indeed,
it is to be considered as such. He took hold of his pen slowly, and
evidently in no very good temper; and then he wrote, â€˜Order for M. le
Chevalier dâ€™Artagnan, captain of my musketeers, to arrest M. le Comte de
la Fere, wherever he is to be found.â€™ He then turned towards me; but I
was looking on without moving a muscle of my face. In all probability he
thought he perceived something like bravado in my tranquil manner,
for he signed hurriedly, and then handing me the order, he said, â€˜Go,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhy, you know, Dâ€™Artagnan, that I have always been a very simple
traveler on this earth, ready to go to the end of the world by the order
of my sovereign; ready to quit it at the summons of my Maker. What does
a man who is thus prepared require in such a case?--a portmanteau, or
a shroud. I am ready at this moment, as I have always been, my dear
NA
NA
â€œI have brought him up in the same principles I laid down for my
own guidance; and you observed that, as soon as he perceived you, he
guessed, that very moment, the motive of your visit. We have thrown him
off his guard for a moment; but do not be uneasy, he is sufficiently
prepared for my disgrace not to be too much alarmed at it. So, let us
NA
NA
â€œAs I broke my sword in the kingâ€™s presence, and threw the pieces at his
feet, I presume that will dispense with the necessity of delivering it

â€œYou are quite right; and besides that, what the deuce do you suppose I

NA
NA
comteâ€™s arm to descend the staircase; and in this manner they arrived at
the landing. Grimaud, whom they had met in the ante-room, looked at them
as they went out together in this manner, with some little uneasiness;
his experience of affairs was quite sufficient to give him good reason
to suspect that there was something wrong.
NA
NA
nod of the head.
Grimaud thanked Dâ€™Artagnan by a grimace, which was evidently intended
for a smile, and accompanied both the friends to the door. Athos entered
first into the carriage; Dâ€™Artagnan followed him without saying a word
to the coachman. The departure had taken place so quietly, that it
excited no disturbance or attention even in the neighborhood. When the
carriage had reached the quays, â€œYou are taking me to the Bastile, I
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
that I undertook the mission with no other object in view than that of
carrying it out exactly as you liked. You surely did not expect that I
was going to get you thrown into prison like that, brutally, and without
any reflection. If I had anticipated that, I should have let the captain
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, it seems simple enough to me. The coachman will take you to the
barrier of the Cours-la-Reine; you will find a horse there which I have
ordered to be kept ready for you; with that horse you will be able to do
three posts without stopping; and I, on my side, will take care not to
return to the king, to tell him that you have gone away, until the very
moment it will be impossible to overtake you. In the meantime you will
have reached Le Havre, and from Le Havre across to England, where you
will find the charming residence of which M. Monk made me a present,
without speaking of the hospitality which King Charles will not fail to
NA
Athos shook his head, and then said, smiling as he did so, â€œNo, no, take
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThat you are no longer twenty years of age. Believe me, I speak
according to my own knowledge and experience. A prison is certain death
for men who are at our time of life. No, no; I will never allow you to
languish in prison in such a way. Why, the very thought of it makes my
NA
NA
as strong, powerful, and enduring as my mind; and, rely upon it, I shall

NA
â€œNo, Dâ€™Artagnan, it is the highest order of reasoning. Do not suppose
that I should in the slightest degree in the world discuss the question
with you, whether you would not be ruined in endeavoring to save me. I
should have done precisely as you propose if flight had been part of
my plan of action; I should, therefore, have accepted from you what,
without any doubt, you would have accepted from me. No! I know you too

NA
NA
NA
â€œOh! that is all the same to me; and king though he be, I would plainly
tell him, â€˜Sire, imprison, exile, kill every one in France and Europe;

Dâ€™Artagnan made a slight movement of his shoulders.
â€œNay, I wish it, I repeat, more than anything; if you were to let me
escape, it would be only to return of my own accord, and constitute
myself a prisoner. I wish to prove to this young man, who is dazzled
by the power and splendor of his crown, that he can be regarded as the
first and chiefest among men only on the one condition of his proving
himself to be the most generous and the wisest. He may punish me,
imprison, torture me, it matters not. He abuses his opportunities, and

And throwing himself back in the carriage, he gnawed the ends of his
mustache with a fury which, for Athos, who knew him well, signified a
resolution either already taken or in course of formation. A profound
silence ensued in the carriage, which continued to roll on, but neither
faster nor slower than before. Athos took the musketeer by the hand.

Chapter LXIII. Three Guests Astonished to Find Themselves at Supper
Together.
The carriage arrived at the outside of the gate of the Bastile. A
soldier on guard stopped it, but Dâ€™Artagnan had only to utter a single
word to procure admittance, and the carriage passed on without further
difficulty. Whilst they were proceeding along the covered way which led
to the courtyard of the governorâ€™s residence, Dâ€™Artagnan, whose lynx
eyes saw everything, even through the walls, suddenly cried out, â€œWhat

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œMake haste and look again, and look at the man who is just getting out
NA
At that very moment a second sentinel stopped Dâ€™Artagnan, and while the
formalities were being gone through, Athos could see at a hundred paces
from him the man whom his friend had pointed out to him. He was, in
fact, getting out of the carriage at the door of the governorâ€™s house.
NA
NA
NA
â€œI cannot very well tell; he is, as I have just now told you, a man in a

â€œUnfortunately, there is no remedy for it; whenever any one meets

â€œAthos, I have an idea; the question is, to spare Aramis the annoyance

NA
â€œI will tell you; or in order to explain myself in the best possible
way, let me relate the affair in my own manner; I will not recommend you
to tell a falsehood, for that would be impossible for you to do; but I
will tell falsehoods enough for both; it is easy to do that when one is
NA
Athos smiled. The carriage stopped where the one we have just now
pointed out had stopped; namely, at the door of the governorâ€™s house.
NA
Athos consented by a gesture. They ascended the staircase. There will
be no occasion for surprise at the facility with which they had entered
into the Bastile, if it be remembered that, before passing the first
gate, in fact, the most difficult of all, Dâ€™Artagnan had announced that
he had brought a prisoner of state. At the third gate, on the contrary,
that is to say, when he had once fairly entered the prison, he merely
NA
few minutes they were in the governorâ€™s dining-room, and the first face
which attracted Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s observation was that of Aramis, who was
seated side by side with Baisemeaux, awaiting the announcement of a
meal whose odor impregnated the whole apartment. If Dâ€™Artagnan pretended
surprise, Aramis did not pretend at all; he started when he saw his
two friends, and his emotion was very apparent. Athos and Dâ€™Artagnan,
however, complimented him as usual, and Baisemeaux, amazed, completely
stupefied by the presence of his three guests, began to perform a few
evolutions around them.

NA
NA
â€œYes, of course you did, although you now seem so struck with amazement.

him, and finished by stammering out, â€œCertainly--I am delighted--but,
upon my honor--I have not the slightest--Ah! I have such a wretched

Baisemeaux hurried towards him. â€œDo not stand on ceremony, my dear

Baisemeaux interrupted the musketeer in the middle of his revelations.
â€œYes, yes; youâ€™re quite right; how could I have forgotten; I remember it
now as well as possible; I beg you a thousand pardons. But now, once for
all, my dear M. dâ€™Artagnan, be sure that at this present time, as at any
other, whether invited or not, you are perfectly at home here, you and
NA
NA
NA
â€œand that is the reason I came. Having nothing to do this evening at the
Palais Royal, I wished to judge for myself what your ordinary style of

Athos bowed. â€œThe comte, who had just left his majesty, handed me an
order which required immediate attention. We were close by here; I
wished to call in, even if it were for no other object than that of
shaking hands with you and of presenting the comte to you, of whom you

NA
NA
NA
â€œAnd he will sup with you two, I suppose, whilst I, unfortunate dog that
I am, must run off on a matter of duty. Oh! what happy beings you are,

NA
with the same expression of delighted surprise, the tone of which was
immediately noticed by Dâ€™Artagnan.
NA
he touched Athos gently on the shoulder, who, astonished also, could not
help exhibiting his surprise a little; which was noticed by Aramis only,
for M. de Baisemeaux was not quite equal to the three friends in point
of intelligence.
NA
â€œI shall only be about an hour, or an hour and a half. I will return in
NA
NA
NA
NA
doubt.
NA
he added, in a low voice, â€œWait for me, Athos; be cheerful and lively
as possible, and above all, donâ€™t allude even to business affairs, for
NA
And with a renewed pressure of the hand, he seemed to warn the comte of
the necessity of keeping perfectly discreet and impenetrable. Baisemeaux
led Dâ€™Artagnan to the gate. Aramis, with many friendly protestations
of delight, sat down by Athos, determined to make him speak; but Athos
possessed every virtue and quality to the very highest degree. If
necessity had required it, he would have been the finest orator in the
world, but on other occasions he would rather have died than have opened
his lips.
Ten minutes after Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s departure, the three gentlemen sat
down to table, which was covered with the most substantial display
of gastronomic luxury. Large joints, exquisite dishes, preserves, the
greatest variety of wines, appeared successively upon the table, which
was served at the kingâ€™s expense, and of which expense M. Colbert would
have found no difficulty in saving two thirds, without any one in the
Bastile being the worse for it. Baisemeaux was the only one who ate and
drank with gastronomic resolution. Aramis allowed nothing to pass by
him, but merely touched everything he took; Athos, after the soup and
three _hors dâ€™oeuvres_, ate nothing more. The style of conversation was
such as might have been anticipated between three men so opposite
in temper and ideas. Aramis was incessantly asking himself by what
extraordinary chance Athos was there at Baisemeauxâ€™s when Dâ€™Artagnan was
no longer there, and why Dâ€™Artagnan did not remain when Athos was there.
Athos sounded all the depths of the mind of Aramis, who lived in the
midst of subterfuge, evasion, and intrigue; he studied his man well and
thoroughly, and felt convinced that he was engaged upon some important
project. And then he too began to think of his own personal affair, and
to lose himself in conjectures as to Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s reason for having left
the Bastile so abruptly, and for leaving behind him a prisoner so badly
introduced and so badly looked after by the prison authorities. But
we shall not pause to examine into the thoughts and feelings of these
personages, but will leave them to themselves, surrounded by the remains
of poultry, game, and fish, which Baisemeauxâ€™s generous knife and
fork had so mutilated. We are going to follow Dâ€™Artagnan instead, who,
getting into the carriage which had brought him, said to the coachman,

Chapter LXIV. What Took Place at the Louvre During the Supper at the
Bastile.
M. de Saint-Aignan had executed the commission with which the king had
intrusted him for La Valliere--as we have already seen in one of the
preceding chapters; but, whatever his eloquence, he did not succeed in
persuading the young girl that she had in the king a protector powerful
enough for her under any combination of circumstances, and that she had
no need of any one else in the world when the king was on her side. In
point of fact, at the very first word which the favorite mentioned
of the discovery of the famous secret, Louise, in a passion of tears,
abandoned herself in utter despair to a sorrow which would have been far
from flattering for the king, if he had been a witness of it from one of
the corners of the room. Saint-Aignan, in his character of ambassador,
felt almost as greatly offended at it as his master himself would have
been, and returned to inform the king what he had seen and heard; and it
is thus we find him, in a state of great agitation, in the presence of
the king, who was, if possible, in a state of even greater flurry than
himself.

the greatest austerity and formality. This young engaged couple coldly
exchanged their little vows in the prim presence of the moon and stars;
and now, when they find they have to break those vows asunder, it plays
NA
Saint-Aignan thought to have made the king laugh; but on the contrary,
from a mere smile Louis passed to the greatest seriousness of manner.
He already began to experience that remorse which the comte had promised
Dâ€™Artagnan he would inflict upon him. He reflected that, in fact, these
young persons had loved and sworn fidelity to each other; that one of
the two had kept his word, and that the other was too conscientious
not to feel her perjury most bitterly. And his remorse was not
unaccompanied; for bitter pangs of jealousy began to beset the kingâ€™s
heart. He did not say another word, and instead of going to pay a visit
to his mother, or the queen, or Madame, in order to amuse himself a
little, and make the ladies laugh, as he himself used to say, he threw
himself into the huge armchair in which his august father Louis XIII.
had passed so many weary days and years in company with Barradat and
Cinq-Mars. Saint-Aignan perceived the king was not to be amused at that
moment; he tried a last resource, and pronounced Louiseâ€™s name, which
made the king look up immediately. â€œWhat does your majesty intend to
do this evening--shall Mademoiselle de la Valliere be informed of your

NA
NA
pass our time in thinking, and musing, and dreaming; when Mademoiselle
de la Valliere shall have sufficiently regretted what she now regrets,
NA
â€œAh! sire, is it possible you can so misunderstand her heart, which is
NA
The king rose, flushed from vexation and annoyance; he was a prey to
jealousy as well as to remorse. Saint-Aignan was just beginning to feel
that his position was becoming awkward, when the curtain before the door
was raised. The king turned hastily round; his first idea was that a
letter from Louise had arrived; but, instead of a letter of love, he
only saw his captain of musketeers, standing upright, and perfectly
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan looked at Saint-Aignan; the kingâ€™s eyes took the same
direction as those of his captain; these looks would have been clear to
any one, and for a still greater reason they were so for Saint-Aignan.
The courtier bowed and quitted the room, leaving the king and Dâ€™Artagnan
alone.
NA
NA
NA
The king was unable to say another word. Pride, however, obliged him
not to pause at what he had done; whenever a sovereign has adopted a
decisive course, even though it be unjust, he is compelled to prove
to all witnesses, and particularly to prove it to himself, that he was
quite right all through. A good means for effecting that--an almost
infallible means, indeed--is, to try and prove his victim to be in the
wrong. Louis, brought up by Mazarin and Anne of Austria, knew better
than any one else his vocation as a monarch; he therefore endeavored to
prove it on the present occasion. After a few momentâ€™s pause, which he
had employed in making silently to himself the same reflections which
we have just expressed aloud, he said, in an indifferent tone: â€œWhat did
NA
NA
â€œSurely he did not allow himself to be arrested without saying

â€œWhy, sire, in order that M. le Comte de la Fere might be able to reach
NA
NA
pride.

There was nothing to say in answer to statements made in such a tone;
the king was astounded at such an obstinate and open resistance on the
part of Dâ€™Artagnan. â€œAt least you had a reason, Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan, for

â€œYour reason cannot be your friendship for the comte, at all
events,--the only one that can be of any avail, the only one that could

himself; and I have come to propose to your majesty to permit me to bear

NA
The king darted towards the table and seized hold of a pen to write the
order for Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s imprisonment. â€œPay attention, monsieur, that this
NA

once done such an act as that, you will never be able to look me in the

moment. Your majesty took up your pen just now to send me to the

it would be your own fault. I should tell you what he, a man full of
the finest sense of delicacy, did not tell you; I should say--â€˜Sire,
you have sacrificed his son, and he defended his son--you sacrificed
himself; he addressed you in the name of honor, of religion, of
virtue--you repulsed, drove him away, imprisoned him.â€™ I should be
harder than he was, for I should say to you--â€˜Sire; it is for you
to choose. Do you wish to have friends or lackeys--soldiers or
slaves--great men or mere puppets? Do you wish men to serve you, or to
bend and crouch before you? Do you wish men to love you, or to be afraid
of you? If you prefer baseness, intrigue, cowardice, say so at once,
sire, and we will leave you,--we who are the only individuals who are
left,--nay, I will say more, the only models of the valor of former
times; we who have done our duty, and have exceeded, perhaps, in courage
and in merit, the men already great for posterity. Choose, sire! and
that, too, without delay. Whatever relics remain to you of the great
nobility, guard them with a jealous eye; you will never be deficient in
courtiers. Delay not--and send me to the Bastile with my friend; for, if
you did not know how to listen to the Comte de la Fere, whose voice is
the sweetest and noblest in all the world when honor is the theme; if
you do not know how to listen to Dâ€™Artagnan, the frankest and honestest
voice of sincerity, you are a bad king, and to-morrow will be a poor
king. And learn from me, sire, that bad kings are hated by their people,
and poor kings are driven ignominiously away.â€™ That is what I had to say
NA
The king threw himself back in his chair, cold as death, and as livid as
a corpse. Had a thunderbolt fallen at his feet, he could not have been
more astonished; he seemed as if his respiration had utterly ceased,
and that he was at the point of death. The honest voice of sincerity,
as Dâ€™Artagnan had called it, had pierced through his heart like a
sword-blade.
Dâ€™Artagnan had said all he had to say. Comprehending the kingâ€™s anger,
he drew his sword, and, approaching Louis XIV. respectfully, he placed
it on the table. But the king, with a furious gesture, thrust aside
the sword, which fell on the ground and rolled to Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s feet.
Notwithstanding the perfect mastery which Dâ€™Artagnan exercised over
himself, he, too, in his turn, became pale, and, trembling with
indignation, said: â€œA king may disgrace a soldier,--he may exile him,
and may even condemn him to death; but were he a hundred times a king,
he has no right to insult him by casting a dishonor upon his sword!
Sire, a king of France has never repulsed with contempt the sword of
a man such as I am! Stained with disgrace as this sword now is, it has
henceforth no other sheath than either your heart or my own! I choose
my own, sire; and you have to thank Heaven and my own patience that I

NA
directed the point of the blade towards his breast. The king, however,
with a movement far more rapid than that of Dâ€™Artagnan, threw his right
arm around the musketeerâ€™s neck, and with his left hand seized hold
of the blade by the middle, and returned it silently to the scabbard.
Dâ€™Artagnan, upright, pale, and still trembling, let the king do all to
the very end. Louis, overcome and softened by gentler feelings, returned
to the table, took a pen in his hand, wrote a few lines, signed them,
and then held it out to Dâ€™Artagnan.

Dâ€™Artagnan seized the kingâ€™s hand, and imprinted a kiss upon it; he then
folded the order, placed it in his belt, and quitted the room. Neither
the king nor the captain had uttered a syllable.

Chapter LXV. Political Rivals.
Dâ€™Artagnan had promised M. de Baisemeaux to return in time for dessert,
and he kept his word. They had just reached the finer and more delicate
class of wines and liqueurs with which the governorâ€™s cellar had the
reputation of being most admirably stocked, when the silver spurs of
the captain resounded in the corridor, and he himself appeared at the
threshold. Athos and Aramis had played a close game; neither of the two
had been able to gain the slightest advantage over the other. They had
supped, talked a good deal about the Bastile, of the last journey to
Fontainebleau, of the intended _fete_ that M. Fouquet was about to give
at Vaux; they had generalized on every possible subject; and no one,
excepting Baisemeaux, had in the slightest degree alluded to private
matters. Dâ€™Artagnan arrived in the very midst of the conversation,
still pale and much disturbed by his interview with the king. Baisemeaux
hastened to give him a chair; Dâ€™Artagnan accepted a glass of wine, and
set it down empty. Athos and Aramis both remarked his emotion; as
for Baisemeaux, he saw nothing more than the captain of the kingâ€™s
musketeers, to whom he endeavored to show every possible attention. But,
although Aramis had remarked his emotion, he had not been able to guess
the cause of it. Athos alone believed he had detected it. For him,
Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s return, and particularly the manner in which he, usually
so impassible, seemed overcome, signified, â€œI have just asked the king
NA
conjecture was correct, Athos smiled, rose from the table, and made a
sign to Dâ€™Artagnan, as if to remind him that they had something else
to do than to sup together. Dâ€™Artagnan immediately understood him,
and replied by another sign. Aramis and Baisemeaux watched this silent
dialogue, and looked inquiringly at each other. Athos felt that he was
called upon to give an explanation of what was passing.
NA
â€œthat you, Aramis, have been supping with a state criminal, and you,
NA
Baisemeaux uttered an exclamation of surprise, and almost of delight;
for he was exceedingly proud and vain of his fortress, and for his own
individual profit, the more prisoners he had, the happier he was, and
the higher in rank the prisoners happened to be, the prouder he felt.
Aramis assumed the expression of countenance he thought the position
justified, and said, â€œWell, dear Athos, forgive me, but I almost
suspected what has happened. Some prank of Raoul and La Valliere, I

are, forgetful that courtiers now exist--you have been to the king, I

peeping out of his belt, and which assuredly can be nothing else than

Baisemeaux held out his hand with his accustomed eagerness. Dâ€™Artagnan
drew two papers from his belt, and presented one of them to the
governor, who unfolded it, and then read, in a low tone of voice,
looking at Athos over the paper, as he did so, and pausing from time to
time: â€œâ€˜Order to detain, in my chateau of the Bastile, Monsieur le Comte

NA
NA
â€œOh, no, on the contrary. I wish the king no harm; and the greatest evil

act of injustice. But you have had a difficult and painful task, I know.

Aramis looked fixedly at Dâ€™Artagnan, and saw that he was not speaking
the truth. But Baisemeaux had eyes for nothing but Dâ€™Artagnan, so great
was his admiration for a man who seemed to make the king do all he
wished.

 replied Dâ€™Artagnan; â€œbut I think the comte could not well do better

your kind and friendly disposition towards me, and particularly for
the enjoyable specimen you have given me of the ordinary fare of the
NA
Baisemeaux, and having received best wishes for a pleasant journey from
them both, Athos set off with Dâ€™Artagnan.
Whilst the _denouement_ of the scene of the Palais Royal was taking
place at the Bastile, let us relate what was going on at the lodgings
of Athos and Bragelonne. Grimaud, as we have seen, had accompanied his
master to Paris; and, as we have said, he was present when Athos went
out; he had observed Dâ€™Artagnan gnaw the corners of his mustache; he
had seen his master get into the carriage; he had narrowly examined both
their countenances, and he had known them both for a sufficiently long
period to read and understand, through the mask of their impassibility,
that something serious was the matter. As soon as Athos had gone, he
began to reflect; he then, and then only, remembered the strange manner
in which Athos had taken leave of him, the embarrassment--imperceptible
as it would have been to any but himself--of the master whose ideas
were, to him, so clear and defined, and the expression of whose wishes
was so precise. He knew that Athos had taken nothing with him but the
clothes he had on him at the time; and yet he seemed to fancy that Athos
had not left for an hour merely; or even for a day. A long absence was
NA
 All these circumstances recurred to his mind, with feelings of deep
affection for Athos, with that horror of isolation and solitude which
invariably besets the minds of those who love; and all these combined
rendered poor Grimaud very melancholy, and particularly uneasy. Without
being able to account to himself for what he did since his masterâ€™s
departure, he wandered about the room, seeking, as it were, for some
traces of him, like a faithful dog, who is not exactly uneasy about his
absent master, but at least is restless. Only as, in addition to the
instinct of the animal, Grimaud subjoined the reasoning faculties of the
man, Grimaud therefore felt uneasy and restless too. Not having found
any indication which could serve as a guide, and having neither seen
nor discovered anything which could satisfy his doubts, Grimaud began
to wonder what could possibly have happened. Besides, imagination is
the resource, or rather the plague of gentle and affectionate hearts. In
fact, never does a feeling heart represent its absent friend to itself
as being happy or cheerful. Never does the dove that wings its flight in
search of adventures inspire anything but terror at home.
Grimaud soon passed from uneasiness to terror; he carefully went over,
in his own mind, everything that had taken place: Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s letter
to Athos, the letter which had seemed to distress Athos so much after
he had read it; then Raoulâ€™s visit to Athos, which resulted in Athos
desiring him (Grimaud) to get his various orders and his court dress
ready to put on; then his interview with the king, at the end of which
Athos had returned home so unusually gloomy; then the explanation
between the father and the son, at the termination of which Athos had
embraced Raoul with such sadness of expression, while Raoul himself went
away equally weary and melancholy; and finally, Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s arrival,
biting, as if he were vexed, the end of his mustache, and leaving again
in the carriage, accompanied by the Comte de la Fere. All this composed
a drama in five acts very clearly, particularly for so analytical an
observer as Grimaud.
The first step he took was to search in his masterâ€™s coat for M.
dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s letter; he found the letter still there, and its contents
were found to run as follows:
â€œMY DEAR FRIEND,--Raoul has been to ask me for some particulars about
the conduct of Mademoiselle de la Valliere, during our young friendâ€™s
residence in London. I am a poor captain of musketeers, and I am
sickened to death every day by hearing all the scandal of the barracks
and bedside conversations. If I had told Raoul all I believe, I know the
poor fellow would have died of it; but I am in the kingâ€™s service, and
cannot relate all I hear about the kingâ€™s affairs. If your heart tells
you to do it, set off at once; the matter concerns you more than it does

Grimaud tore, not a handful, but a finger-and-thumbful of hair out of
his head; he would have done more if his head of hair had been in a more
flourishing condition.
NA
been playing her pranks; what people say about her and the king is true,
then; our young master has been deceived; he ought to know it. Monsieur
le comte has been to see the king, and has told him a piece of his mind;
and then the king sent M. dâ€™Artagnan to arrange the affair. Ah! gracious
NA
NA
This discovery made the perspiration break out all over poor Grimaudâ€™s
face. He did not waste any more time in useless conjecture, but clapped
his hat on his head, and ran to Raoulâ€™s lodgings.
Raoul, after Louise had left him, had mastered his grief, if not his
affection; and, compelled to look forward on that perilous road over
which madness and revulsion were hurrying him, he had seen, from the
very first glance, his father exposed to the royal obstinacy, since
Athos had himself been the first to oppose any resistance to the royal
will. At this moment, from a very natural sequence of feeling, the
unhappy young man remembered the mysterious signs which Athos had made,
and the unexpected visit of Dâ€™Artagnan; the result of the conflict
between a sovereign and a subject revealed itself to his terrified
vision. As Dâ€™Artagnan was on duty, that is, a fixture at his post
without the possibility of leaving it, it was certainly not likely that
he had come to pay Athos a visit merely for the pleasure of seeing him.
He must have come to say something to him. This something in the
midst of such painful conjectures must have been the news of either a
misfortune or a danger. Raoul trembled at having been so selfish as
to have forgotten his father for his affection; at having, in a word,
passed his time in idle dreams, or in an indulgence of despair, at a
time when a necessity existed for repelling such an imminent attack on
Athos. The very idea nearly drove him frantic; he buckled on his sword
and ran towards his fatherâ€™s lodgings. On his way there he encountered
Grimaud, who, having set off from the opposite pole, was running with
equal eagerness in search of the truth. The two men embraced each other
most warmly.

Chapter LXVI. In Which Porthos Is Convinced without Having Understood
Anything.
The good and worthy Porthos, faithful to all the laws of ancient
chivalry, had determined to wait for M. de Saint-Aignan until sunset;
and as Saint-Aignan did not come, as Raoul had forgotten to communicate
with his second, and as he found that waiting so long was very
wearisome, Porthos had desired one of the gate-keepers to fetch him a
few bottles of good wine and a good joint of meat,--so that, at least,
he might pass away the time by means of a glass or two and a mouthful of
something to eat. He had just finished when Raoul arrived, escorted by
Grimaud, both of them riding at full speed. As soon as Porthos saw the
two cavaliers riding at such a pace along the road, he did not for a
moment doubt but that they were the men he was expecting, and he rose
from the grass upon which he had been indolently reclining and began to
stretch his legs and arms, saying, â€œSee what it is to have good habits.
The fellow has finished by coming, after all. If I had gone away he
NA
then threw himself into a martial attitude, and drew himself up to the
full height of his gigantic stature. But instead of Saint-Aignan, he
only saw Raoul, who, with the most despairing gestures, accosted him by

â€œFor having forgotten you. But I assure you my head seems utterly lost.

Porthos gave a start that would have thrown down a wall.
NA
NA

Porthos turned towards Grimaud, as if he needed a second confirmation of
the intelligence.
NA
NA
NA
â€œAs we came along we questioned some persons, who saw the carriage pass;

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Porthos looked at the young man, as if to say, â€œWhat does that matter to

did not ask any other question. He mounted his horse again; and Porthos,
assisted by Grimaud, had already done the same.
NA
NA
Raoul sighed deeply, and then paused suddenly.
NA
â€œNo, only I feel how utterly helpless our position is. Can we three
NA
NA
NA
Raoul could not resist a feeling of admiration at the sight of such
perfect confidence, heroic in its simplicity. These were truly the
celebrated men who, by three or four, attacked armies and assaulted
castles! Men who had terrified death itself, who had survived the wrecks
of a tempestuous age, and still stood, stronger than the most robust of
the young.
NA
NA
NA
â€œHe ought by this time to have returned home, after having taken my
NA
NA
speaking little, but that to the purpose.
Accordingly, they hastened towards the fortress, when one of those
chances which Heaven bestows on men of strong will caused Grimaud
suddenly to perceive the carriage, which was entering by the great gate
of the drawbridge. This was the moment that Dâ€™Artagnan was, as we have
seen, returning from his visit to the king. In vain was it that Raoul
urged on his horse in order to join the carriage, and to see whom it
contained. The horses had already gained the other side of the great
gate, which again closed, while one of the sentries struck the nose of
Raoulâ€™s horse with his musket; Raoul turned about, only too happy to
find he had ascertained something respecting the carriage which had
contained his father.
NA
â€œIf we wait a little it is certain he will leave; donâ€™t you think so, my
NA
NA
NA
Raoul returned no answer, for any hypothesis was admissible.
He instructed Grimaud to lead the horses to the little street
Jean-Beausire, so as to give rise to less suspicion, and himself with
his piercing gaze watched for the exit either of Dâ€™Artagnan or the
carriage. Nor had he decided wrongly; for twenty minutes had not elapsed
before the gate reopened and the carriage reappeared. A dazzling of
the eyes prevented Raoul from distinguishing what figures occupied the
interior. Grimaud averred that he had seen two persons, and that one of
them was his master. Porthos kept looking at Raoul and Grimaud by turns,
in the hope of understanding their idea.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
horses were just disappearing down the Faubourg St. Antoine.
NA
NA
NA
Porthos darted a second glance at Raoul, quite worthy of the first.
Raoul replied only by spurring the flanks of his steed. In a few moments
the three cavaliers had overtaken the carriage, and followed it so
closely that their horsesâ€™ breath moistened the back of it. Dâ€™Artagnan,
whose senses were ever on the alert, heard the trot of the horses, at
the moment when Raoul was telling Porthos to pass the chariot, so as to
see who was the person accompanying Athos. Porthos complied, but could
not see anything, for the blinds were lowered. Rage and impatience were
gaining mastery over Raoul. He had just noticed the mystery preserved by
Athosâ€™s companion, and determined on proceeding to extremities. On his
part Dâ€™Artagnan had perfectly recognized Porthos, and Raoul also, from
under the blinds, and had communicated to the comte the result of his
observation. They were desirous only of seeing whether Raoul and Porthos
would push the affair to the uttermost. And this they speedily did, for
Raoul, presenting his pistol, threw himself on the leader, commanding
the coachmen to stop. Porthos seized the coachman, and dragged him from
his seat. Grimaud already had hold of the carriage door. Raoul threw

them.

â€œOh! as for me, I was only accompanying Athos as far as the barrier, and

 continued the comte, â€œyou will return quietly to Paris with your horse

Raoul hung down his head and said not a word more. Athos descended from
the carriage and mounted the horse which had brought Porthos, and
which seemed no little pleased at the exchange. Then they embraced,
and clasped each otherâ€™s hands, and interchanged a thousand pledges of
eternal friendship. Porthos promised to spend a month with Athos at the
first opportunity. Dâ€™Artagnan engaged to take advantage of his first
leave of absence; and then, having embraced Raoul for the last time: â€œTo

knew wrote very seldom, these words expressed everything. Raoul was
moved even to tears. He tore himself away from the musketeer and
departed.

The reader has not forgotten that, on quitting the Bastile, Dâ€™Artagnan
and the Comte de la Fere had left Aramis in close confabulation with
Baisemeaux. When once these two guests had departed, Baisemeaux did not
in the least perceive that the conversation suffered by their absence.
He used to think that wine after supper, and that of the Bastile
in particular, was excellent, and that it was a stimulation quite
sufficient to make any honest man talkative. But he little knew
his Greatness, who was never more impenetrable than at dessert. His
Greatness, however, perfectly understood M. de Baisemeaux, when he
reckoned on making the governor discourse by the means which the latter
regarded as efficacious. The conversation, therefore, without flagging
in appearance, flagged in reality; for Baisemeaux not only had it nearly
all to himself, but further, kept speaking only of that singular event,
the incarceration of Athos, followed by so prompt an order to set him
again at liberty. Nor, moreover, had Baisemeaux failed to observe that
the two orders of arrest and of liberation, were both in the kingâ€™s
hand. But then, the king would not take the trouble to write similar
orders except under pressing circumstances. All this was very
interesting, and, above all, very puzzling to Baisemeaux; but as, on the
other hand, all this was very clear to Aramis, the latter did not
attach to the occurrence the same importance as did the worthy governor.
Besides, Aramis rarely put himself out of the way for anything, and he
had not yet told M. de Baisemeaux for what reason he had now done so.
And so at the very climax of Baisemeauxâ€™s dissertation, Aramis suddenly
interrupted him.

little society at present. If I must own it to you, dear M. dâ€™Herblay,
the fact is, to stay at the Bastile appears, for the most part,
distressing and distasteful to persons of the gay world. As for the
ladies, it is never without a certain dread, which costs me infinite
trouble to allay, that they succeed in reaching my quarters. And,
indeed, how should they avoid trembling a little, poor things, when
they see those gloomy dungeons, and reflect that they are inhabited

concentrated their gaze on the face of Aramis, the worthy governorâ€™s
tongue faltered more and more until it ended by stopping altogether.
â€œNo, you donâ€™t understand me, my dear M. Baisemeaux; you donâ€™t
understand me. I do not at all mean to speak of society in general, but
of a particular society--of _the_ society, in a word--to which you are

Baisemeaux nearly dropped the glass of muscat which he was in the act of
NA
NA
self-possession. â€œAre you not a member of a secret society, my dear M.

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œListen to me, my dear M. Baisemeaux; I say yes, you say no; one of us
two necessarily says what is true, and the other, it inevitably follows,

NA
Baisemeaux rose, manifesting unspeakable emotion: â€œGo on, dear M.
NA
Aramis then spoke, or rather recited the following paragraph, in the
same tone as if he had been reading it from a book: â€œThe aforesaid
captain or governor of a fortress shall allow to enter, when need shall
arise, and on demand of the prisoner, a confessor affiliated to the

loyally, dear De Baisemeaux, and having heard you to believe no more

Aramis, gravely, â€œdoes not faithfully serve the masters whom he

â€œOh, yes! I understand that it is a more difficult position to have

I shall return to tell them that they are mistaken, and that they must

But, gentle as the words were, they had the same effect on the unhappy
governor as a clap of thunder. Baisemeaux became livid, and it seemed to
him as if Aramisâ€™s beaming eyes were two forks of flame, piercing to

NA
â€œYes, I; but we have nothing to unravel together, seeing that you are

â€œDoes not the Gospel say, â€˜Watch, for the moment is known only of God?â€™
Do not the rules of the order say, â€˜Watch, for that which I will, you

Baisemeauxâ€™s servant appeared at the threshold of the door.
NA

Aramis looked at De Baisemeaux with a calm and confident eye.

The messenger entered, saluted, and handed in the report. Baisemeaux
ran his eye over it, and raising his head, said in surprise, â€œNo. 12 is

The governor then made a sign to the messenger, and when he had quitted
