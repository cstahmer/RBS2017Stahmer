Introduction
I found myself in Twilight Land. How I ever got there I cannot tell, but
there I was in Twilight Land.
What is Twilight Land? It is a wonderful, wonderful place where no sun
shines to scorch your back as you jog along the way, where no rain falls
to make the road muddy and hard to travel, where no wind blows the dust
into your eyes or the chill into your marrow. Where all is sweet and
quiet and ready to go to bed.
Where is Twilight Land? Ah! that I cannot tell you. You will either have
to ask your mother or find it for yourself.
There I was in Twilight Land. The birds were singing their good-night
NA
was full of still brightness, and the moon in the east hung in the
purple gray like a great bubble as yellow as gold. All the air was full
of the smell of growing things. The high-road was gray, and the trees
were dark.
I drifted along the road as a soap-bubble floats before the wind, or as
a body floats in a dream. I floated along and I floated along past the
trees, past the bushes, past the mill-pond, past the mill where the old
miller stood at the door looking at me.
I floated on, and there was the Inn, and it was the Sign of Mother
Goose.
The sign hung on a pole, and on it was painted a picture of Mother Goose
with her gray gander.
It was to the Inn I wished to come.
I floated on, and I would have floated past the Inn, and perhaps have
gotten into the Land of Never-Come-Back-Again, only I caught at
the branch of an apple-tree, and so I stopped myself, though the
apple-blossoms came falling down like pink and white snowflakes.
The earth and the air and the sky were all still, just as it is at
twilight, and I heard them laughing and talking in the tap-room of
the Inn of the Sign of Mother Goose--the clinking of glasses, and the
rattling and clatter of knives and forks and plates and dishes. That was
where I wished to go.
So in I went. Mother Goose herself opened the door, and there I was.
The room was all full of twilight; but there they sat, every one of
them. I did not count them, but there were ever so many: Aladdin, and
Ali Baba, and Fortunatis, and Jack-the-Giant-Killer, and Doctor Faustus,
and Bidpai, and Cinderella, and Patient Grizzle, and the Soldier who
cheated the Devil, and St. George, and Hans in Luck, who traded and
traded his lump of gold until he had only an empty churn to show for it;
and there was Sindbad the Sailor, and the Tailor who killed seven flies
at a blow, and the Fisherman who fished up the Genie, and the Lad who
fiddled for the Jew in the bramble-bush, and the Blacksmith who made
Death sit in his apple-tree, and Boots, who always marries the Princess,
whether he wants to or not--a rag-tag lot as ever you saw in your life,
gathered from every place, and brought together in Twilight Land.
Each one of them was telling a story, and now it was the turn of the
Soldier who cheated the Devil.

He filled his long pipe full of tobacco, and then he tilted it upside
down and sucked in the light of the candle.
Puff! puff! puff! and a cloud of smoke went up about his head, so that
you could just see his red nose shining through it, and his bright eyes
twinkling in the midst of the smoke-wreath, like two stars through a
thin cloud on a summer night.

He took a drink from his mug of beer, and then he began.

The Stool of Fortune
Once upon a time there came a soldier marching along the road, kicking
up a little cloud of dust at each step--as strapping and merry and
bright-eyed a fellow as you would wish to see in a summer day. Tramp!
tramp! tramp! he marched, whistling as he jogged along, though he
carried a heavy musket over his shoulder and though the sun shone hot
and strong and there was never a tree in sight to give him a bit of
shelter.
At last he came in sight of the Kingâ€™s Town and to a great field of
stocks and stones, and there sat a little old man as withered and brown
as a dead leaf, and clad all in scarlet from head to foot.

to drop into your gun instead of a bullet. Wait you here, and about
sunset there will come a great black bird flying. In one claw it carries
a feather cap and in the other a round stone. Shoot me the silver button
at that bird, and if your aim is good it will drop the feather cap and
the pebble. Bring them to me to the great town-gate and I will pay you a

NA
Well, there he sat and sat and sat and sat until the sun touched the rim
of the ground, and then, just as the old man said, there came flying a
great black bird as silent as night. The soldier did not tarry to look
or to think. As the bird flew by up came the gun to his shoulder, squint
went his eye along the barrel--Puff! bang--!
I vow and declare that if the shot he fired had cracked the sky he
could not have been more frightened. The great black bird gave a yell so
terrible that it curdled the very blood in his veins and made his hair
stand upon end. Away it flew like a flash--a bird no longer, but a
great, black demon, smoking and smelling most horribly of brimstone,
and when the soldier gathered his wits, there lay the feather cap and a
little, round, black stone upon the ground.
NA
NA
the feather cap into one pocket and the round stone into another, and
shouldering his musket marched away until he reached the town-gate, and
there was the old man waiting for him.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA

I bargained for, and so itâ€™s ten dollars and not one you shall pay me
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
 said he, â€œif it is a hundred dollars you want, you will have to come
NA
town with the soldier at his heels.
Up one street he went and down another, until at last he came to a
great, black, ancient ramshackle house; and that was where he lived. In
he walked without so much as a rap at the door, and so led the way to
a great room with furnaces and books and bottles and jars and dust and
cobwebs, and three grinning skulls upon the mantelpiece, each with a
candle stuck atop of it, and there he left the soldier while he went to
get the hundred dollars.
The soldier sat him down upon a three-legged stool in the corner and
began staring about him; and he liked the looks of the place as little
as any he had seen in all of his life, for it smelled musty and dusty,
it did: the three skulls grinned at him, and he began to think that the

Now the little old man in scarlet was a great magician, and there was
little or nothing in that house that had not some magic about it, and of
all things the three-legged stool had been conjured the most.
â€œI wish that instead of being here I might be well out of my scrape,
NA
words left his lips when--whisk! whir!--away flew the stool through the
window, so suddenly that the soldier had only just time enough to gripe
it tight by the legs to save himself from falling. Whir! whiz!--away it
flew like a bullet. Up and up it went--so high in the air that the earth
below looked like a black blanket spread out in the night; and then down
it came again, with the soldier still griping tight to the legs, until
at last it settled as light as a feather upon a balcony of the kingâ€™s
palace; and when the soldier caught his wind again he found himself
without a hat, and with hardly any wits in his head.
There he sat upon the stool for a long time without daring to move, for
he did not know what might happen to him next. There he sat and sat, and
by-and-by his ears got cold in the night air, and then he noticed for
the first time that he had lost his head gear, and bethought himself of
the feather cap in his pocket. So out he drew it and clapped it upon his
head, and then--lo and behold!--he found he had become as invisible as
NA
NA
to find some place not so cool as where he sat.
He stepped in at an open window, and there he found himself in a
beautiful room, hung with cloth of silver and blue, and with chairs and
tables of white and gold; dozens and scores of waxlights shone like so
many stars, and lit every crack and cranny as bright as day, and there
at one end of the room upon a couch, with her eyelids closed and fast
asleep, lay the prettiest princess that ever the sun shone upon. The
soldier stood and looked and looked at her, and looked and looked at
her, until his heart melted within him like soft butter, and then he
kissed her.
NA

head.

garden and fell in love with you, and now I have come to ask you if you

NA
NA
from now I will come again, and will show myself to you, but just now it

NA
NA
Thereupon the soldier kissed her and said good-bye, and then stepped
out of the window as he had stepped in. He sat him down upon his
NA
NA
good living was to be had.
Whir! whiz! away flew the stool as high and higher than it had flown
before, and then down it came again, and down and down until it lit as
light as a feather in the street before the tavern door. The soldier
tucked his feather cap in his pocket, and the three-legged stool under
his arm, and in he went and ordered a pot of beer and some white bread
and cheese.
Meantime, at the kingâ€™s palace was such a gossiping and such a hubbub as
had not been heard there for many a day; for the pretty princess was not
slow in telling how the invisible King of the Wind had come and asked
her to marry him; and some said it was true and some said it was not
true, and everybody wondered and talked, and told their own notions of
the matter. But all agreed that three days would show whether what had
been told was true or no.
As for the soldier, he knew no more how to do what he had promised to do
than my grandmotherâ€™s cat; for where was he to get clothes fine enough
for the King of the Wind to wear? So there he sat on his three-legged
stool thinking and thinking, and if he had known all that I know he
NA
last--â€œI wish that this stool could help me now as well as it can carry
NA
NA
The wonders of the three-legged stool were wonders indeed!
Hardly had the words left the soldierâ€™s lips when down came something
tumbling about his ears from up in the air; and what should it be but
just such a suit of clothes as he had in his mind--all crusted over with
gold and silver and jewels.
NA
NA
I, if I had been in his place, and had a few minutes to think of all
that I wanted.
So he found out the trick of the stool, and after that wishing and
having were easy enough, and by the time the three days were ended the
real King of the Wind himself could not have cut a finer figure. Then
down sat the soldier upon his stool, and wished himself at the kingâ€™s
palace. Away he flew through the air, and by-and-by there he was, just
where he had been before. He put his feather cap upon his head, and
stepped in through the window, and there he found the princess with her
father, the king, and her mother, the queen, and all the great lords and
nobles waiting for his coming; but never a stitch nor a hair did they
see of him until he stood in the very midst of them all. Then he whipped
the feather cap off of his head, and there he was, shining with silver
and gold and glistening with jewels--such a sight as manâ€™s eyes never
saw before.
NA
handsome in his fine clothes that the princess was as glad to hear those
words as any she had ever listened to in all of her life.
NA
NA
a palace upon that shall be fit for the wife of the King of the Wind to
NA
NA
ground back of the palace, which is so wide and long that all my army
can march round and round in it without getting into its own way; and
NA
NA
and disappeared from the sight of all as quickly as one might snuff out
a candle.
He mounted his three-legged stool and away he flew through the air until
he had come again to the tavern where he was lodging. There he sat him
down and began to churn his thoughts, and the butter he made was worth
the having, I can tell you. He wished for a grand palace of white
marble, and then he wished for all sorts of things to fill it--the
finest that could be had. Then he wished for servants in clothes of gold
and silver, and then he wished for fine horses and gilded coaches.
Then he wished for gardens and orchards and lawns and flower-plats and
fountains, and all kinds and sorts of things, until the sweat ran down
his face from hard thinking and wishing. And as he thought and wished,
all the things he thought and wished for grew up like soap-bubbles from
nothing at all.
Then, when day began to break, he wished himself with his fine clothes
to be in the palace that his own wits had made, and away he flew through
the air until he had come there safe and sound.
But when the sun rose and shone down upon the beautiful palace and all
the gardens and orchards around it, the king and queen and all the court
stood dumb with wonder at the sight. Then, as they stood staring, the
gates opened and out came the soldier riding in his gilded coach with
his servants in silver and gold marching beside him, and such a sight
the daylight never looked upon before that day.
Well, the princess and the soldier were married, and if no couple had
ever been happy in the world before, they were then. Nothing was heard
but feasting and merrymaking, and at night all the sky was lit with
fireworks. Such a wedding had never been before, and all the world was
glad that it had happened.
That is, all the world but one; that one was the old man dressed in
scarlet that the soldier had met when he first came to town. While all
the rest were in the hubbub of rejoicing, he put on his thinking-cap,
and by-and-by began to see pretty well how things lay, and that, as they
NA
â€œso the soldier has found out all about the three-legged stool, has he?
NA
to watch for his chance to do the soldier an ill turn.
Now, a week or two after the wedding, and after all the gay doings had
ended, a grand hunt was declared, and the king and his new son-in-law
and all the court went to it. That was just such a chance as the old
magician had been waiting for; so the night before the hunting-party
returned he climbed the walls of the garden, and so came to the
wonderful palace that the soldier had built out of nothing at all, and
there stood three men keeping guard so that no one might enter.
But little that troubled the magician. He began to mutter spells and
strange words, and all of a sudden he was gone, and in his place was
a great black ant, for he had changed himself into an ant. In he ran
through a crack of the door (and mischief has got into many a manâ€™s
house through a smaller hole for the matter of that). In and out ran the
ant through one room and another, and up and down and here and there,
until at last in a far-away part of the magic palace he found the
three-legged stool, and if I had been in the soldierâ€™s place I would
have chopped it up into kindling-wood after I had gotten all that I
wanted. But there it was, and in an instant the magician resumed his
NA
palace and the princess and all who are within it, together with its
orchards and its lawns and its gardens and everything, may be removed to
NA
And as the stool had obeyed the soldier, so everything was done now just
as the magician said.
The next morning back came the hunting-party, and as they rode over the
hill--lo and behold!--there lay stretched out the great parade ground
in which the kingâ€™s armies used to march around and around, and the land
was as bare as the palm of my hand. Not a stick or a stone of the palace
was left; not a leaf or a blade of the orchards or gardens was to be
seen.
The soldier sat as dumb as a fish, and the king stared with eyes and
NA
he, at last, finding words and wit.
NA
NA
NA
But that was easier said than done, for, quick as a wink, as they came
to lay hold of him, the soldier whisked the feather cap from his pocket
and clapped it upon his head, and then they might as well have hoped to
find the south wind in winter as to find him.
But though he got safe away from that trouble he was deep enough in the
dumps, you may be sure of that. Away he went, out into the wide world,
leaving that town behind him. Away he went, until by-and-by he came to
a great forest, and for three days he travelled on and on--he knew not
whither. On the third night, as he sat beside a fire which he had built
to keep him warm, he suddenly bethought himself of the little round
stone which had dropped from the birdâ€™s claw, and which he still had in
NA
NA
and looking at it, but he could make nothing of it for the life of him.
Nevertheless, it might have some wishing power about it, like the
NA
NA
case; but just now it did the soldier no more good to wish than it does
NA
NA
Puff! Bang! Away flew the embers upon every side, and back tumbled the
soldier, and there in the middle of the flame stood just such a grim,
black being as he had one time shot at with the silver button.
As for the poor soldier, he just lay flat on his back and stared with
eyes like saucers, for he thought that his end had come for sure.
NA
marrow of the soldierâ€™s bones.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Without a word the spirit of the stone snatched the soldier up, and
flew away with him swifter than the wind. Over forest, over field, over
mountain and over valley he flew, until at last, just at the crack of
day, he set him down in front of his own palace gate in the far country
where the magician had transported it.
After that the soldier knew his way quickly enough. He clapped his
feather cap upon his head and into the palace he went, and from one room
to another, until at last he came to where the princess sat weeping and
wailing, with her pretty eyes red from long crying.
Then the soldier took off his cap again, and you may guess what sounds
of rejoicing followed. They sat down beside one another, and after the
soldier had eaten, the princess told him all that had happened to her;
how the magician had found the stool, and how he had transported the
palace to this far-away land; how he came every day and begged her to
marry him--which she would rather die than do.
To all this the soldier listened, and when she had ended her story he
bade her to dry her tears, for, after all, the jug was only cracked,
and not past mending. Then he told her that when the sorcerer came again
that day she should say so and so and so and so, and that he would be by
to help her with his feather cap upon his head.
After that they sat talking together as happy as two turtle-doves,
until the magicianâ€™s foot was heard on the stairs. And then the soldier
clapped his feather cap upon his head just as the door opened.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
into a lion. If you can do that I may perhaps believe you to be as great
NA
NA
and strange words, and then all of a sudden he was gone, and in his
place there stood a lion with bristling mane and flaming eyes--a sight
fit of itself to kill a body with terror.
NA
and thereupon the magician took his own shape again.
NA
NA
yourself, now I wish to see how little you can become. Let me see you
NA
NA
Then all of a sudden he was gone just as he was gone before, and in his
place was a little mouse sitting up and looking at the princess with a
pair of eyes like glass beads.
But he did not sit there long. This was what the soldier had planned
for, and all the while he had been standing by with his feather hat upon
his head. Up he raised his foot, and down he set it upon the mouse.
Crunch!--that was an end of the magician.
After that all was clear sailing; the soldier hunted up the three-legged
stool and down he sat upon it, and by dint of no more than just a little
wishing, back flew palace and garden and all through the air again to
the place whence it came.
I do not know whether the old king ever believed again that his
son-in-law was the King of the Wind; anyhow, all was peace and
friendliness thereafter, for when a body can sit upon a three-legged
stool and wish to such good purpose as the soldier wished, a body is
just as good as a king, and a good deal better, to my mind.
The Soldier who cheated the Devil looked into his pipe; it was nearly
out. He puffed and puffed and the coal glowed brighter, and fresh clouds
of smoke rolled up into the air. Little Brown Betty came and refilled,
from a crock of brown foaming ale, the mug which he had emptied. The
Soldier who had cheated the Devil looked up at her and winked one eye.
NA
pointed, as he spoke, with the stem of his pipe towards old Bidpai, who
sat with closed eyes meditating inside of himself.
The old man opened his eyes, the whites of which were as yellow as
saffron, and wrinkled his face into innumerable cracks and lines. Then
he closed his eyes again; then he opened them again; then he cleared
his throat and began: â€œThere was once upon a time a man whom other men

The Talisman of Solomon
There was once upon a time a man whom other men called Aben Hassen
the Wise. He had read a thousand books of magic, and knew all that the
ancients or moderns had to tell of the hidden arts.
The King of the Demons of the Earth, a great and hideous monster,
named Zadok, was his servant, and came and went as Aben Hassen the Wise
ordered, and did as he bade. After Aben Hassen learned all that it was
possible for man to know, he said to himself, â€œNow I will take my ease
NA
monster, â€œI have read in my books that there is a treasure that was one
time hidden by the ancient kings of Egypt--a treasure such as the eyes

NA
NA
 said Aben Hassen the Wise.
NA
Man and transported him across mountain and valley, across land and
sea, until he brought him to a country known as the â€œLand of the Black
NA
showed the Magician the treasure, and it was a sight such as man had
never looked upon before or since the days that the dark, ancient ones
hid it. With his treasure Aben Hassen built himself palaces and gardens
and paradises such as the world never saw before. He lived like an
emperor, and the fame of his doings rang through all the four corners of
the earth.
Now the queen of the Black Isles was the most beautiful woman in the
world, but she was as cruel and wicked and cunning as she was beautiful.
No man that looked upon her could help loving her; for not only was
she as beautiful as a dream, but her beauty was of that sort that it
bewitched a man in spite of himself.
NA
â€œis it true that men say of you that you have discovered a hidden
NA
Hassen so that his wisdom all crumbled away like sand, and he became
just as foolish as other men.
NA
Aben Hassen the Wise spent all that day with the queen, and when he left
the palace he was like a man drunk and dizzy with love. Moreover, he had
promised to show the queen the hidden treasure the next day.
As Aben Hassen, like a man in a dream, walked towards his own house, he
met an old man standing at the corner of the street. The old man had a
talisman that hung dangling from a chain, and which he offered for sale.
When Aben Hassen saw the talisman he knew very well what it was--that
it was the famous talisman of King Solomon the Wise. If he who possessed
the talisman asked it to speak, it would tell that man both what to do
and what not to do.
The Wise Man bought the talisman for three pieces of silver (and wisdom
has been sold for less than that many a time), and as soon as he had the
talisman in his hands he hurried home with it and locked himself in a
room.
NA
NA
NA

The Wise Man sat all that night pondering and thinking upon what the
Talisman had said. When morning came he washed and dressed himself, and
NA
NA
the steps of the palace.
NA
the Demon brought from under his clothes a wand, one-half of which was
of silver and one-half of which was of gold. The Wise Man touched the
steps of the palace with the silver end of the staff. Instantly all
the sound and hum of life was hushed. The thread of life was cut by the
knife of silence, and in a moment all was as still as death.
NA
NA
NA
power to enter here but the master of Zadok, the King of the Demons of
NA
NA
NA
was commanded; and of all the treasure that he had, the Wise Man took
nothing with him but a jar of golden money and a jar of silver money.
As soon as the Wise Man stood upon the ground of India, he drew from
beneath his robe a little jar of glass.
NA
Then the Demon knew that now his turn had come. He besought and implored
the Wise Man to have mercy upon him; but it was all in vain. Then the
Demon roared and bellowed till the earth shook and the sky grew dark
overhead. But all was of no avail; into the jar he must go, and into the
jar he went. Then the Wise Man stoppered the jar and sealed it. He wrote
an inscription of warning upon it, and then he buried it in the ground.
NA
NA
NA
golden money and the jar of silver money with thee; for that which is
evil in the greatest is evil in the least. Thou fool! The treasure is
NA
NA
the jar of gold and the jar of silver that he had brought with him, and
then he stamped the mould down upon it. After that the Wise Man began
his life all over again. He bought, and he sold, and he traded, and
by-and-by he became rich. Then he built himself a great house, and in
the foundation he laid the jar in which the Demon was bottled.
Then he married a young and handsome wife. By-and-by the wife bore him a
son, and then she died.
This son was the pride of his fatherâ€™s heart; but he was as vain and
foolish as his father was wise, so that all men called him Aben Hassen
the Fool, as they called the father Aben Hassen the Wise.
Then one day death came and called the old man, and he left his son all
that belonged to him--even the Talisman of Solomon.
Young Aben Hassen the Fool had never seen so much money as now belonged
to him. It seemed to him that there was nothing in the world he could
not enjoy. He found friends by the dozens and scores, and everybody
seemed to be very fond of him.
He asked no questions of the Talisman of Solomon, for to his mind there
was no need of being both wise and rich. So he began enjoying himself
with his new friends. Day and night there was feasting and drinking and
singing and dancing and merrymaking and carousing; and the money that
the old man had made by trading and wise living poured out like water
through a sieve.
Then, one day came an end to all this junketing, and nothing remained to
the young spend-thrift of all the wealth that his father had left him.
Then the officers of the law came down upon him and seized all that was
left of the fine things, and his fair-weather friends flew away from his
troubles like flies from vinegar. Then the young man began to think of
the Talisman of Wisdom. For it was with him as it is with so many of
us: When folly has emptied the platter, wisdom is called in to pick the
bones.

So he straightway took a spade and went out into the garden, where the
Talisman had told him not to go. He dug and dug under the cherry-tree,
and by-and-by his spade struck something hard. It was a vessel of brass,
and it was full of silver money. Upon the lid of the vessel were these
words, engraved in the handwriting of the old man who had died:
â€œMy son, this vessel full of silver has been brought from the
treasure-house of the ancient kings of Egypt. Take this, then, that thou

NA

The next day he began to spend the money he had found, and his friends
soon gathered around him again.
The vessel of silver money lasted a week, and then it was all gone; not
a single piece was left.
Then the young man bethought himself again of the Talisman of Solomon.

The young man did not tarry long after he heard what the Talisman had
said. He seized a spade and hurried away to the fig-tree in the garden
as fast as he could run. He dug and dug, and by-and-by his spade struck
something hard. It was a copper vessel, and it was filled with gold
money. Upon the lid of the vessel was engraved these words in the
NA
â€œthou hast been warned once; be warned again. The gold money in this
vessel has been brought from the treasure-house of the ancient kings
of Egypt. Take it; be advised by the Talisman of Solomon; be wise and

The gold in the vessel lasted maybe for a month of jollity and
merrymaking, but at the end of that time there was nothing left--not a
copper farthing.

built into the wall. The red stone turns upon a pivot. Behind the stone
is a hollow space. As thou wouldst save thy life from peril, go not near

He lit a lantern and went down into the vault beneath the house. There,
as the Talisman had said, was the red stone built into the wall. He
pressed the stone, and it turned upon its pivot as the Talisman had said
it would turn. Within was a hollow space, as the Talisman said there
would be. In the hollow space there was a casket of silver. The young
man snatched it up, and his hands trembled for joy.
Upon the lid of the box were these words in the fatherâ€™s handwriting,
written in letters as red as blood: â€œFool, fool! Thou hast been a fool
once, thou hast been a fool twice; be not a fool for a third time.
NA
NA
He opened it. There was nothing in it but a hollow glass jar the size of
an egg. The young man took the jar from the box; it was as hot as fire.
He cried out and let it fall. The jar burst upon the floor with a crack
of thunder; the house shook and rocked, and the dust flew about in
clouds. Then all was still; and when Aben Hassen the Fool could see
through the cloud of terror that enveloped him he beheld a great, tall,
hideous being as black as ink, and with eyes that shone like coals of
fire.
When the young man saw that terrible creature his tongue clave to
the roof of his mouth, and his knees smote together with fear, for he
thought that his end had now certainly come.
NA
NA
 answered the being. â€œI was once thy fatherâ€™s slave, and now I am thine,
thou being his son. When thou speakest I must obey, and whatever thou

And thereupon the Demon vanished like a flash.

NA
Such riches were never seen in that land as the young man now possessed.
There was no end to the treasure that poured in upon him. He lived like
an emperor. He built a palace more splendid than the palace of the king.
He laid out vast gardens of the most exquisite beauty, in which there
were fountains as white as snow, trees of rare fruit and flowers that
filled all the air with their perfume, summer-houses of alabaster and
ebony.
Every one who visited him was received like a prince, entertained like a
king, given a present fit for an emperor, and sent away happy. The fame
of all these things went out through all the land, and every one talked
of him and the magnificence that surrounded him.
It came at last to the ears of the king himself, and one day he said
to his minister, â€œLet us go and see with our own eyes if all the things
NA
So the king and his minister disguised themselves as foreign merchants,
and went that evening to the palace where the young man lived. A servant
dressed in clothes of gold and silver cloth stood at the door, and
called to them to come in and be made welcome. He led them in, and to a
chamber lit with perfumed lamps of gold. Then six black slaves took them
in charge and led them to a bath of white marble. They were bathed in
perfumed water and dried with towels of fine linen. When they came
forth they were clad in clothes of cloth of silver, stiff with gold and
jewels. Then twelve handsome white slaves led them through a vast and
splendid hall to a banqueting-room.
When they entered they were deafened with the noise of carousing and
merrymaking.
Aben Hassen the Fool sat at the head of the table upon a throne of
gold, with a canopy of gold above his head. When he saw the king and
the minister enter, he beckoned to them to come and sit beside him.
He showed them special favor because they were strangers, and special
servants waited upon them.
The king and his minister had never seen anything like what they then
saw. They could hardly believe it was not all magic and enchantment.
At the end of the feast each of the guests was given a present of great
value, and was sent away rejoicing. The king received a pearl as big as
a marble; the minister a cup of wrought gold.
The next morning the king and the prime-minister were talking over what

that the young man has discovered some vast hidden treasure. Now,
according to the laws of this kingdom, the half of any treasure that is
discovered shall belong to the kingâ€™s treasury. If I were in your place

NA
NA
So they sent a royal guard and brought the young man to the kingâ€™s
palace. When the young man saw in the king and the prime-minister his
guests of the night before, whom he had thought to be only foreign
merchants, he fell on his face and kissed the ground before the throne.
But the king spoke to him kindly, and raised him up and sat him on the
seat beside him. They talked for a while concerning different things,
and then the king said at last, â€œTell me, my friend, whence comes all
the inestimable wealth that you must possess to allow you to live as you

Aben Hassen the Fool was trying to deceive him. He laughed; he was
NA
unbelievable tale? Now I am more than ever sure that you have discovered
a treasure and that you wish to keep the knowledge of it from me,
knowing, as you do, that the one-half of it by law belongs to me. Take
NA
him into prison. He shall stay there and have fifty lashes every day
NA
It was done as the king said, and by-and-by Aben Hassen the Fool lay in
the prison, smarting and sore with the whipping he had had.
Then he began again to think of the Talisman of Solomon.

NA
NA
will by-and-by pardon thee and will let thee go. In the meantime bear
thy punishment; perhaps it will cure thee of thy folly. Only do not call

In an instant there sounded a rumble as of thunder. The floor swayed and
rocked beneath the young manâ€™s feet. The dust flew in clouds, and there
stood Zadok as black as ink, and with eyes that shone like coals of
fire.
NA
He removed the cloths from the young manâ€™s back, and rubbed the places
that smarted with a cooling unguent. Instantly the pain and smarting
ceased, and the merchantâ€™s son had perfect ease.
NA
NA
you have brought me? The king has commanded me to tell him and I could

father, and he, not desiring it himself, hid it in the earth so that no

NA
NA
NA
He stamped his foot upon the ground. In an instant the walls of the
prison split asunder, and the sky was above them. The Demon leaped from
the earth, carrying the young man by the girdle, and flew through the
air so swiftly that the stars appeared to slide away behind them. In a
moment he set the young man again upon the ground, and Aben Hassen the
Fool found himself at the end of what appeared to be a vast and splendid
garden.
NA
was here that I saw thy father seal it so that no one but the master of
Zadok may enter. Thou mayst go in any time it may please thee, for it is

NA
drew a circle upon the ground where they stood; then he stamped with his
heel upon the circle. Instantly the earth opened, and there appeared a
flight of marble steps leading downward into the earth. Zadok led the
way down the steps and the young man followed. At the bottom of the
steps there was a door of adamant. Upon the door were these words in
letters as black as ink, in the handwriting of the old man who had gone:
â€œOh, fool! Fool! Beware what thou doest. Within here shalt thou find
NA
There was a key of brass in the door. The King of the Demons turned the
key and opened the door. The young man entered after him.
Aben Hassen the Fool found himself in a vast vaulted room, lit by the
light of a single carbuncle set in the centre of the dome above. In the
middle of the marble floor was a great basin twenty paces broad, and
filled to the brim with money such as he had found in the brazen vessel
in the garden.
The young man could not believe what he saw with his own eyes. â€œOh,
NA
NA
NA
He led him from this room to another--like it vaulted, and like it lit
by a carbuncle set in the dome of the roof above. In the middle of the
floor was a basin such as Aben Hassen the Fool had seen in the other
room beyond; only this was filled with gold as that had been filled with
silver, and the gold was like that he had found in the garden. When
the young man saw this vast and amazing wealth he stood speechless and
NA
NA
He took the young man by the hand and led him into a third room--vaulted
as the other two had been, lit as they had been by a carbuncle in the
roof above. But when the young manâ€™s eyes saw what was in this third
room, he was like a man turned drunk with wonder. He had to lean against
the wall behind him, for the sight made him dizzy.
In the middle of the room was such as basin as he had seen in the two
other rooms, only it was filled with jewels--diamonds and rubies and
emeralds and sapphires and precious stones of all kinds--that sparkled
and blazed and flamed like a million stars. Around the wall, and facing
the basin from all sides, stood six golden statues. Three of them were
statues of the kings and three of them were statues of the queens who
had gathered together all this vast and measureless wealth of ancient
Egypt.
There was space for a seventh statue, but where it should have stood was
a great arched door of adamant. The door was tightly shut, and there was
neither lock nor key to it. Upon the door were written these words in
letters of flame:
â€œBehold! Beyond this door is that alone which shall satisfy all thy
NA
NA
all the other wonders that surrounded him--â€œtell me what is there that

years ago, and which he left behind him when he quitted this place for

vaulted rooms and out through the door of adamant, and Zadok locked it
behind them and gave the key to the young man.

They ascended the steps, and so reached the garden above. Then Zadok
struck his heel upon the ground, and the earth closed as it had opened.
He led the young man from the spot until they had come to a wide avenue
NA
NA
Thereupon he vanished like a flash, leaving the young man standing like
one in a dream.
He saw before him a garden of such splendor and magnificence as he had
never dreamed of even in his wildest fancy. There were seven fountains
as clear as crystal that shot high into the air and fell back into
basins of alabaster. There was a broad avenue as white as snow, and
thousands of lights lit up everything as light as day. Upon either side
of the avenue stood a row of black slaves, clad in garments of white
silk, and with jewelled turbans upon their heads. Each held a flaming
torch of sandal-wood. Behind the slaves stood a double row of armed men,
and behind them a great crowd of other slaves and attendants, dressed
each as magnificently as a prince, blazing and flaming with innumerable
jewels and ornaments of gold.
But of all these things the young man thought nothing and saw nothing;
for at the end of the marble avenue there arose a palace, the like of
which was not in the four quarters of the earth--a palace of marble and
gold and carmine and ultramarine--rising into the purple starry sky,
and shining in the moonlight like a vision of Paradise. The palace was
illuminated from top to bottom and from end to end; the windows shone
like crystal, and from it came sounds of music and rejoicing.
When the crowd that stood waiting saw the young man appear, they
shouted: â€œWelcome! Welcome! To the master who has come again! To Aben

The young man walked up the avenue of marble to the palace, surrounded
by the armed attendants in their dresses of jewels and gold, and
preceded by dancing-girls as beautiful as houris, who danced and sung

to me. And to think that if I had listened to the Talisman of Solomon I

That was the way he came back to the treasure of the ancient kings of
Egypt, and to the palace of enchantment that his father had quitted.
For seven months he lived a life of joy and delight, surrounded by
crowds of courtiers as though they were a king, and going from pleasure
to pleasure without end. Nor had he any fear of an end coming to it, for
he knew that his treasure was inexhaustible. He made friends with the
princes and nobles of the land. From far and wide people came to visit
him, and the renown of his magnificence filled all the world. When
NA
NA
So for seven months he lived a life of joy and delight; then one morning
he awakened and found everything changed to grief and mourning. Where
the day before had been laughter, to-day was crying. Where the day
before had been mirth, to-day was lamentation. All the city was shrouded
in gloom, and everywhere was weeping and crying.
Seven black slaves stood on guard near Aben Hassen the Fool as he lay
NA
slaves.
Instantly all the slaves began howling and beating their heads, and he
to whom the young man had spoken fell down with his face in the dust,
and lay there twisting and writhing like a worm.
NA
NA
NA
At the doorway of the room stood a beautiful female slave, bearing in
her hands a jewelled basin of gold, filled with rose-water, and a fine
linen napkin for the young man to wash and dry his hands upon. â€œTell

Instantly the beautiful slave dropped the golden basin upon the stone
floor, and began shrieking and tearing her clothes. â€œHe has asked the

The young man began to grow frightened; he arose from his couch,
and with uneven steps went out into the anteroom. There he found his
chamberlain waiting for him with a crowd of attendants and courtiers.
NA
Instantly they who stood waiting began crying and tearing their clothes
and beating their hands. As for the chamberlain--he was a reverend old
man--his eyes sparkled with anger, and his fingers twitched as though
NA
contented with all thou hast and with all that we do for thee without

Thereupon he tore his cap from his head and flung it upon the ground,
and began beating himself violently upon the head with great outcrying.
Aben Hassen the Fool, not knowing what to think or what was to happen,
ran back into the bedroom again. â€œI think everybody in this place has

Then he bethought himself, for the first time since he came to that
land, of the Talisman of Solomon.

who was the wisest and most cunning magician in the world, turned her
into stone, and with her all the attendants in her palace. No one since
that time has been permitted to enter the palace--it is forbidden for
any one even to ask a question concerning it; but every year, on the
day on which the queen was turned to stone, the whole land mourns with

He led the way, and the young man followed, filled with wonder and
astonishment. Not a sound was to be heard, not a thing moved, but
silence hung like a veil between the earth and the sky.
Following the Demon, the young man ascended a flight of steps, and so
entered the vestibule of the palace. There stood guards in armor of
brass and silver and gold. But they were without life--they were all of
stone as white as alabaster. Thence they passed through room after room
and apartment after apartment crowded with courtiers and nobles and
lords in their robes of office, magnificent beyond fancying, but each
silent and motionless--each a stone as white as alabaster. At last
they entered an apartment in the very centre of the palace. There sat
seven-and-forty female attendants around a couch of purple and gold.
Each of the seven-and-forty was beautiful beyond what the young man
could have believed possible, and each was clad in a garment of silk
as white as snow, embroidered with threads of silver and studded with
glistening diamonds. But each sat silent and motionless--each was a
stone as white as alabaster.
Upon the couch in the centre of the apartment reclined a queen with a
crown of gold upon her head. She lay there motionless, still. She was
cold and dead--of stone as white as marble. The young man approached and
looked into her face, and when he looked his breath became faint and his
heart grew soft within him like wax in a flame of fire.
He sighed; he melted; the tears burst from his eyes and ran down his
NA
me this wonder of beauty and love! Alas! That I have seen her; for the
world is nothing to me now. O Zadok! That she were flesh and blood,
instead of cold stone! Tell me, Zadok, I command you to tell me, was

master, he touched with the gold, it became alive, even if it were a

NA
NA

eagerness.
Zadok laughed and vanished. The young man stood for a while looking down
at the beautiful figure of alabaster. Then he touched the lips with the
golden tip of the wand. In an instant there came a marvellous change.
He saw the stone melt, and begin to grow flexible and soft. He saw it
become warm, and the cheeks and lips grow red with life. Meantime a
murmur had begun to rise all through the palace. It grew louder and
louder--it became a shout. The figure of the queen that had been stone
opened its eyes.

Aben Hassen the Fool fell upon his knees. â€œI am he who was sent to bring

The queen smiled--her teeth sparkled like pearls. â€œIf you have brought

He grew suddenly dizzy; the world swam before his eyes.
For seven days nothing was heard in the town but rejoicing and joy. The

Then, for the first time, the Talisman spoke without being questioned.

Instantly the ground shook beneath their feet, the dust rose in clouds,
and Zadok appeared, as black as ink, and with eyes that shone like coals

He seized the queen and the young man by the girdle, and in an instant
transported them to the garden and to the treasure-house.

The young man immediately drew a circle upon the ground with his
finger-tip. He struck his heel upon the circle. The ground opened,
disclosing the steps leading downward. The young man descended the steps
with the queen behind him, and behind them both came the Demon Zadok.
The young man opened the door of adamant and entered the first of the
vaulted rooms.
When the queen saw the huge basin full of silver treasure, her cheeks
and her forehead flushed as red as fire.
They went into the next room, and when the queen saw the basin of gold
her face turned as white as ashes.
They went into the third room, and when the queen saw the basin of
jewels and the six golden statues her face turned as blue as lead, and
her eyes shone green like a snakeâ€™s.

NA
They went forward together. The young man pushed the door with his hand.
It opened swiftly and silently, and they entered.
Within was a narrow room as red as blood. A flaming lamp hung from the
ceiling above. The young man stood as though turned to stone, for there
stood a gigantic Black Demon with a napkin wrapped around his loins and
a scimitar in his right hand, the blade of which gleamed like lightning
in the flame of the lamp. Before him lay a basket filled with sawdust.
When the queen saw what she saw she screamed in a loud voice, â€œThou hast
found it! Thou hast found it! Thou hast found what alone can satisfy all

The young man heard the Demon Zadok give a yell of laughter. He saw a
whirl and a flash, and then he knew nothing.
The Black had struck--the blade had fallen, and the head of Aben Hassen
the Fool rolled into the basket of sawdust that stood waiting for it.

Ill-Luck and the Fiddler
Once upon a time St. Nicholas came down into the world to take a peep
at the old place and see how things looked in the spring-time. On he
stepped along the road to the town where he used to live, for he had
a notion to find out whether things were going on nowadays as they
one time did. By-and-by he came to a cross-road, and who should he
see sitting there but Ill-Luck himself. Ill-Luckâ€™s face was as gray as
ashes, and his hair as white as snow--for he is as old as Grandfather
Adam--and two great wings grew out of his shoulders--for he flies fast
and comes quickly to those whom he visits, does Ill-Luck.
Now, St. Nicholas had a pocketful of hazel-nuts, which he kept cracking
and eating as he trudged along the road, and just then he came upon one
with a worm-hole in it. When he saw Ill-Luck it came into his head to do
a good turn to poor sorrowful man.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
himself small and smaller, and--phst! he was in the nut before you could
wink.
Then what do you think St. Nicholas did? In his hand he held a little
plug of wood, and no sooner had Ill-Luck entered the nut than he stuck
the plug in the hole, and there was manâ€™s enemy as tight as fly in a
bottle.
NA
tossed the hazel-nut under the roots of an oak-tree near by, and went
his way.
And that is how this story begins.
Well, the hazel-nut lay and lay and lay, and all the time that it lay
there nobody met with ill-luck; but, one day, who should come travelling
that way but a rogue of a Fiddler, with his fiddle under his arm. The
day was warm, and he was tired; so down he sat under the shade of the
oak-tree to rest his legs. By-and-by he heard a little shrill voice
NA
NA
 says he.
NA
NA
NA
his arm and off he marched.
But before he had gone six steps he stopped. He was one of your peering,
prying sort, and liked more than a little to know all that was to be
known about this or that or the other thing that he chanced to see or
hear. â€œI wonder where Ill-Luck can be, to be in such a tight place as
NA
NA
NA
NA
Thereupon the Fiddler laid aside his fiddle and bow, and fell to
poking and prying under the roots until he found the nut. Then he began
twisting and turning it in his fingers, looking first on one side and
then on the other, and all the while Ill-Luck kept crying, â€œLet me out!
NA
It was not long before the Fiddler found the little wooden plug, and
then nothing would do but he must take a peep inside the nut to see if
Ill-Luck was really there. So he picked and pulled at the wooden plug,
until at last out it came; and--phst! pop! out came Ill-Luck along with
it.
Plague take the Fiddler! say I.
NA
in that hazel-nut, and you are the man that has let me out; for once
NA
without giving the Fiddler time to speak a word, Ill-Luck caught him up
by the belt, and--whiz! away he flew like a bullet, over hill and over
valley; over moor and over mountain, so fast that not enough wind was
NA
By-and-by he came to a garden, and there he let the Fiddler drop on
the soft grass below. Then away he flew to attend to other matters of
greater need.
When the Fiddler had gathered his wits together, and himself to
his feet, he saw that he lay in a beautiful garden of flowers and
fruit-trees and marble walks and what not, and that at the end of
it stood a great, splendid house, all built of white marble, with a
fountain in front, and peacocks strutting about on the lawn.
Well, the Fiddler smoothed down his hair and brushed his clothes a bit,
and off he went to see what was to be seen at the grand house at the end
of the garden.
He entered the door, and nobody said no to him. Then he passed through
one room after another, and each was finer than the one he left behind.
Many servants stood around; but they only bowed, and never asked whence
he came. At last he came to a room where a little old man sat at a
table. The table was spread with a feast that smelled so good that it
brought tears to the Fiddlerâ€™s eyes and water to his mouth, and all
the plates were of pure gold. The little old man sat alone, but another
place was spread, as though he were expecting some one. As the Fiddler

NA
NA

and eat; and when I have told you all, you will say it was not Ill-Luck,

The Fiddler had his own mind about that; but, all the same, down he sat
at the table, and fell to with knife and fork at the good things, as
though he had not had a bite to eat for a week of Sundays.

and without wife or child. And this morning I said to myself that the
first body that came to my house I would take for a son--or a daughter,
as the case might be. You are the first, and so you shall live with me
as long as I live, and after I am gone everything that I have shall be
NA
The Fiddler did nothing but stare with open eyes and mouth, as though he
would never shut either again.
Well, the Fiddler lived with the old man for maybe three or four days as
snug and happy a life as ever a mouse passed in a green cheese. As for
the gold and silver and jewels--why, they were as plentiful in that
house as dust in a mill! Everything the Fiddler wanted came to his hand.
He lived high, and slept soft and warm, and never knew what it was to
want either more or less, or great or small. In all of those three or
four days he did nothing but enjoy himself with might and main.
But by-and-by he began to wonder where all the good things came from.
Then, before long, he fell to pestering the old man with questions about
the matter.
At first the old man put him off with short answers, but the Fiddler was
a master-hand at finding out anything he wanted to know. He dinned and
drummed and worried until flesh and blood could stand it no longer. So
at last the old man said that he would show him the treasure-house where
all his wealth came from, and at that the Fiddler was tickled beyond
measure.
The old man took a key from behind the door and led him out into the
garden. There in a corner by the wall was a great trap-door of iron. The
old man fitted the key to the lock and turned it. He lifted the door,
and then went down a steep flight of stone steps, and the Fiddler
followed close at his heels. Down below it was as light as day, for in
the centre of the room hung a great lamp that shone with a bright light
and lit up all the place as bright as day. In the floor were set three
great basins of marble: one was nearly full of silver, one of gold, and
one of gems of all sorts.
NA
yours. It was left to me as I will leave it to you, and in the meantime
you may come and go as you choose and fill your pockets whenever you
wish to. But there is one thing you must not do: you must never open
that door yonder at the back of the room. Should you do so, Ill-Luck
NA
Oh no! The Fiddler would never think of doing such a thing as opening
the door. The silver and gold and jewels were enough for him. But since
the old man had given him leave, he would just help himself to a few of
the fine things. So he stuffed his pockets full, and then he followed
the old man up the steps and out into the sunlight again.
It took him maybe an hour to count all the money and jewels he had
brought up with him. After he had done that, he began to wonder what was
inside of the little door at the back of the room. First he wondered;
then he began to grow curious; then he began to itch and tingle and burn
as though fifty thousand I-want-to-know nettles were sticking into him
from top to toe. At last he could stand it no longer. â€œIâ€™ll just go down

So down he took the key, and off he marched to the garden. He opened the
trap-door, and went down the steep steps to the room below. There was
the door at the end of the room, but when he came to look there was no

Tut! tut! tut! Well, since I have come so far, it would be a pity to

opened the door wide.
Before him was a great long passageway, and at the far end of it he
could see a spark of light as though the sun were shining there. He
listened, and after a while he heard a sound like the waves beating on

for a long time. Since I have come so far, I may as well see the end of

went on and on, and the spark of light kept growing larger and larger,
and by-and-by--pop! out he came at the other end of the passage.
Sure enough, there he stood on the sea-shore, with the waves beating and
dashing on the rocks. He stood looking and wondering to find himself in
such a place, when all of a sudden something came with a whiz and a rush
and caught him by the belt, and away he flew like a bullet.
By-and-by he managed to screw his head around and look up, and there it
NA
gave over kicking.
Well; on and on they flew, over hill and valley, over moor and mountain,
until they came to another garden, and there Ill-Luck let the Fiddler
drop.
Swash! Down he fell into the top of an apple-tree, and there he hung in
the branches.
It was the garden of a royal castle, and all had been weeping and woe
(though they were beginning now to pick up their smiles again), and this
was the reason why:
The king of that country had died, and no one was left behind him but
the queen. But she was a prize, for not only was the kingdom hers, but
she was as young as a spring apple and as pretty as a picture; so that
there was no end of those who would have liked to have had her, each man
for his own. Even that day there were three princes at the castle, each
one wanting the queen to marry him; and the wrangling and bickering and
squabbling that was going on was enough to deafen a body. The poor young
queen was tired to death with it all, and so she had come out into
the garden for a bit of rest; and there she sat under the shade of an
apple-tree, fanning herself and crying, when--
Swash! Down fell the Fiddler into the apple-tree and down fell a dozen
apples, popping and tumbling about the queenâ€™s ears.
The queen looked up and screamed, and the Fiddler climbed down.

NA
it with my eyes and heard it with my ears. I see how it is now. You were
sent hither from heaven to be my husband, and my husband you shall be.
You shall be king of this country, half-and-half with me as queen, and
NA
You can guess whether or not that was music to the Fiddlerâ€™s ears.
So the princes were sent packing, and the Fiddler was married to the
queen, and reigned in that country.
Well, three or four days passed, and all was as sweet and happy as a
spring day. But at the end of that time the Fiddler began to wonder what
was to be seen in the castle. The queen was very fond of him, and was
glad enough to show him all the fine things that were to be seen; so
hand in hand they went everywhere, from garret to cellar.
But you should have seen how splendid it all was! The Fiddler felt more
certain than ever that it was better to be a king than to be the richest
man in the world, and he was as glad as glad could be that Ill-Luck had
brought him from the rich little old man over yonder to this.
So he saw everything in the castle but one thing. â€œWhat is behind that

Yes, that was a very fine thing to say; but before an hour had gone

the door behind him. Well, he went on and on until--pop! there he was
out at the farther end, and before he knew what he was about he had
stepped out upon the sea-shore, just as he had done before.
Whiz! whirr! Away flew the Fiddler like a bullet, and there was Ill-Luck
carrying him by the belt again. Away they sped, over hill and valley,
over moor and mountain, until the Fiddlerâ€™s head grew so dizzy that
he had to shut his eyes. Suddenly Ill-Luck let him drop, and down he
fell--thump! bump!--on the hard ground. Then he opened his eyes and sat
up, and, lo and behold! there he was, under the oak-tree whence he had
started in the first place. There lay his fiddle, just as he had left
it. He picked it up and ran his fingers over the strings--trum, twang!
Then he got to his feet and brushed the dirt and grass from his knees.
He tucked his fiddle under his arm, and off he stepped upon the way he
had been going at first.

Empty Bottles
In the old, old days when men were wiser than they are in these times,
there lived a great philosopher and magician, by name Nicholas Flamel.
Not only did he know all the actual sciences, but the black arts as
well, and magic, and what not. He conjured demons so that when a body
passed the house of a moonlight night a body might see imps, great and
small, little and big, sitting on the chimney stacks and the ridge-pole,
clattering their heels on the tiles and chatting together.
He could change iron and lead into silver and gold; he discovered the
elixir of life, and might have been living even to this day had he
thought it worth while to do so.
There was a student at the university whose name was Gebhart, who was so
well acquainted with algebra and geometry that he could tell at a single
glance how many drops of water there were in a bottle of wine. As
for Latin and Greek--he could patter them off like his A B Câ€™s.
Nevertheless, he was not satisfied with the things he knew, but was for
learning the things that no schools could teach him. So one day he came
knocking at Nicholas Flamelâ€™s door.

midst of his books and bottles and diagrams and dust and chemicals and
cobwebs, making strange figures upon the table with jackstraws and a
piece of chalk--for your true wise man can squeeze more learning out of
jackstraws and a piece of chalk than we common folk can get out of all
the books in the world.
No one else was in the room but the wise manâ€™s servant, whose name was
Babette.

NA
and from early in the morning until late at night, so that my head has
hummed and my eyes were sore, yet I have not learned those things that
I wish most of all to know--the arts that no one but you can teach. Will

The wise man shook his head.

NA
â€œSuppose I undertook to teach you, would you give up everything of joy
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
It seemed to Gebhart that he had learned all that Nicholas Flamel had to
teach him.
It was in the gray of the dawning, and the master took the pupil by the
hand and led him up the rickety stairs to the roof of the house, where
nothing was to be seen but gray sky, high roofs, and chimney stacks from
which the smoke rose straight into the still air.
NA
that I know, and the time has come to show you the wonderful thing that
has been waiting for us from the beginning when time was. You have given
up wealth and the world and pleasure and joy and love for the sake of
wisdom. Now, then, comes the last test--whether you can remain faithful
NA
After he said that he stripped his cloak away from his shoulders and
laid bare the skin. Then he took a bottle of red liquor and began
bathing his shoulder-blades with it; and as Gebhart, squatting upon
the ridge-pole, looked, he saw two little lumps bud out upon the smooth
skin, and then grow and grow and grow until they became two great wings
as white as snow.
NA
there is a long, long journey before us, and if you should lose your
NA
Then he spread the two great wings, and away he flew as fast as the
wind, with Gebhart hanging to his belt.
Over hills, over dales, over mountains, over moors he flew, with the
brown earth lying so far below that horses and cows looked like pismires
and men like fleas.
Then, by-and-by, it was over the ocean they were crossing, with the
great ships that pitched and tossed below looking like chips in a puddle
in rainy weather.
At last they came to a strange land, far, far away, and there the master
lit upon a sea-shore where the sand was as white as silver. As soon as
his feet touched the hard ground the great wings were gone like a puff
of smoke, and the wise man walked like any other body.
At the edge of the sandy beach was a great, high, naked cliff; and the
only way of reaching the top was by a flight of stone steps, as slippery
as glass, cut in the solid rock.
The wise man led the way, and the student followed close at his heels,
every now and then slipping and stumbling so that, had it not been for
the help that the master gave him, he would have fallen more than once
and have been dashed to pieces upon the rocks below.
At last they reached the top, and there found themselves in a desert,
without stick of wood or blade of grass, but only gray stones and skulls
and bones bleaching in the sun.
In the middle of the plain was a castle such as the eyes of man never
saw before, for it was built all of crystal from roof to cellar.
Around it was a high wall of steel, and in the wall were seven gates of
polished brass.
The wise man led the way straight to the middle gate of the seven, where
there hung a horn of pure silver, which he set to his lips. He blew
a blast so loud and shrill that it made Gebhartâ€™s ears tingle. In an
instant there sounded a great rumble and grumble like the noise of
loud thunder, and the gates of brass swung slowly back, as though of
themselves.
But when Gebhart saw what he saw within the gates his heart crumbled
away for fear, and his knees knocked together; for there, in the very
middle of the way, stood a monstrous, hideous dragon, that blew out
flames and clouds of smoke from his gaping mouth like a chimney a-fire.
But the wise master was as cool as smooth water; he thrust his hand
into the bosom of his jacket and drew forth a little black box, which he
flung straight into the gaping mouth.
Snap!--the dragon swallowed the box.
The next moment it gave a great, loud, terrible cry, and, clapping and
rattling its wings, leaped into the air and flew away, bellowing like a
bull.
If Gebhart had been wonder-struck at seeing the outside of the castle,
he was ten thousand times more amazed to see the inside thereof. For,
as the master led the way and he followed, he passed through
four-and-twenty rooms, each one more wonderful than the other.
Everywhere was gold and silver and dazzling jewels that glistened so
brightly that one had to shut oneâ€™s eyes to their sparkle. Beside all
this, there were silks and satins and velvets and laces and crystal and
ebony and sandal-wood that smelled sweeter than musk and rose leaves.
All the wealth of the world brought together into one place could
not make such riches as Gebhart saw with his two eyes in these
four-and-twenty rooms. His heart beat fast within him.
At last they reached a little door of solid iron, beside which hung a
sword with a blade that shone like lightning. The master took the sword
in one hand and laid the other upon the latch of the door. Then he
turned to Gebhart and spoke for the first time since they had started
upon their long journey.
NA
little while I shall be as one dead. As soon as that comes to pass, go
you straightway through to the room beyond, where you will find upon a
marble table a goblet of water and a silver dagger. Touch nothing else,
and look at nothing else, for if you do all will be lost to both of us.
Bring the water straightway, and sprinkle my face with it, and when that
is done you and I will be the wisest and greatest men that ever lived,
for I will make you equal to myself in all that I know. So now swear to
do what I have just bid you, and not turn aside a hairâ€™s breadth in the
going and the coming.
NA
Then the master opened the door and entered, with Gebhart close at his
heels.
In the centre of the room was a great red cock, with eyes that shone
like sparks of fire. So soon as he saw the master he flew at him,
screaming fearfully, and spitting out darts of fire that blazed and
sparkled like lightning.
It was a dreadful battle between the master and the cock. Up and down
they fought, and here and there. Sometimes the student could see the
wise man whirling and striking with his sword; and then again he would
be hidden in a sheet of flame. But after a while he made a lucky stroke,
and off flew the cockâ€™s head. Then, lo and behold! instead of a cock it
was a great, hairy, black demon that lay dead on the floor.
But, though the master had conquered, he looked like one sorely sick. He
was just able to stagger to a couch that stood by the wall, and there he
fell and lay, without breath or motion, like one dead, and as white as
wax.
As soon as Gebhart had gathered his wits together he remembered what the
master had said about the other room.
The door of it was also of iron. He opened it and passed within, and
there saw two great tables or blocks of polished marble. Upon one was
the dagger and a goblet of gold brimming with water. Upon the other lay
the figure of a woman, and as Gebhart looked at her he thought her more
beautiful than any thought or dream could picture. But her eyes were
closed, and she lay like a lifeless figure of wax.
After Gebhart had gazed at her a long, long time, he took up the goblet
and the dagger from the table and turned towards the door.
Then, before he left that place, he thought that he would have just one
more look at the beautiful figure. So he did, and gazed and gazed until
his heart melted away within him like a lump of butter; and, hardly
knowing what he did, he stooped and kissed the lips.
Instantly he did so a great humming sound filled the whole castle, so
sweet and musical that it made him tremble to listen. Then suddenly the
figure opened its eyes and looked straight at him.
NA

Then the beautiful woman arose and stepped down from the table to the
floor; and if Gebhart thought her beautiful before, he thought her a
thousand times more beautiful now that her eyes looked into his.
NA

me back to life again. You are he, and now you shall live with me
forever. In this castle is the wealth gathered by the king of the genii,
and it is greater than all the riches of the world. It and the castle
likewise shall be yours. I can transport everything into any part of the
world you choose, and can by my arts make you prince or king or emperor.
NA
NA
He led the way into the other room, the lady following him, and so they
both stood together by the couch where the wise man lay. When the lady
saw his face she cried out in a loud voice: â€œIt is the great master!

the water of life and the dagger of death. The master is not dead, but
sleeping; if you sprinkle that water upon him he will awaken, young,
handsome and more powerful than the greatest magician that ever lived.
I myself, this castle, and everything that is in it will be his, and,
instead of your becoming a prince or a king or an emperor, he will be so
in your place. That, I say, will happen if he wakens. Now the dagger
of death is the only thing in the world that has power to kill him. You
have it in your hand. You have but to give him one stroke with it
while he sleeps, and he will never waken again, and then all will be

Gebhart neither spoke nor moved, but stood looking down upon his master.
Then he set down the goblet very softly on the floor, and, shutting his
eyes that he might not see the blow, raised the dagger to strike.

Then Gebhart opened his eyes.
There sat the wise man in the midst of his books and bottles and
diagrams and dust and chemicals and cobwebs, making strange figures upon
the table with jackstraws and a piece of chalk.
And Babette, who had just opened the cupboard door for the loaf of
bread and the cheese, shut it again with a bang, and went back to her
spinning.
So Gebhart had to go back again to his Greek and Latin and algebra and
geometry; for, after all, one cannot pour a gallon of beer into a quart
pot, or the wisdom of a Nicholas Flamel into such an one as Gebhart.
As for the name of this story, why, if some promises are not bottles
full of nothing but wind, there is little need to have a name for
anything.

Good Gifts and a Foolâ€™s Folly.
Give a fool heaven and earth, and all the stars, and he will make ducks
and drakes of them.
Once upon a time there was an old man, who, by thrifty living and long
saving, had laid by a fortune great enough to buy ease and comfort and
pleasure for a lifetime.
By-and-by he died, and the money came to his son, who was of a different
sort from the father; for, what that one had gained by the labor of a
whole year, the other spent in riotous living in one week.
So it came about in a little while that the young man found himself
without so much as a single penny to bless himself withal. Then his
fair-weather friends left him, and the creditors came and seized upon
his house and his household goods, and turned him out into the cold
wide world to get along as best he might with the other fools who lived
there.
Now the young spendthrift was a strong, stout fellow, and, seeing
nothing better to do, he sold his fine clothes and bought him a porterâ€™s
basket, and went and sat in the corner of the market-place to hire
himself out to carry this or that for folk who were better off in the
world, and less foolish than he.
There he sat, all day long, from morning until evening, but nobody came
to hire him. But at last, as dusk was settling, there came along an old
man with beard as white as snow hanging down below his waist. He stopped
in front of the foolish spendthrift, and stood looking at him for a
while; then, at last, seeming to be satisfied, he beckoned with his
NA
and if you are wise, and keep a still tongue in your head, I will pay
NA
You may depend upon it the young man needed no second bidding to such a
matter. Up he rose, and took his basket, and followed the old man, who
led the way up one street and down another, until at last they came to a
rickety, ramshackle house in a part of the town the young man had never
been before. Here the old man stopped and knocked at the door, which
was instantly opened, as though of itself, and then he entered with
the young spendthrift at his heels. The two passed through a dark
passage-way, and another door, and then, lo and behold! all was changed;
for they had come suddenly into such a place as the young man would not
have believed could be in such a house, had he not seen it with his own
eyes. Thousands of waxen tapers lit the place as bright as day--a great
oval room, floored with mosaic of a thousand bright colors and strange
figures, and hung with tapestries of silks and satins and gold and
silver. The ceiling was painted to represent the sky, through which flew
beautiful birds and winged figures so life-like that no one could tell
that they were only painted, and not real. At the farther side of the
room were two richly cushioned couches, and thither the old man led the
way with the young spendthrift following, wonder-struck, and there the
two sat themselves down. Then the old man smote his hands together, and,
in answer, ten young men and ten beautiful girls entered bearing a feast
of rare fruits and wines which they spread before them, and the young
man, who had been fasting since morning, fell to and ate as he had not
eaten for many a day.
The old man, who himself ate but little, waited patiently for the other
NA
NA
Thereupon he rose from the couch and led the way, the young man
following, through an arch door-way into a garden, in the centre of
which was an open space paved with white marble, and in the centre of
that again a carpet, ragged and worn, spread out upon the smooth stones.
Without saying a word, the old man seated himself upon one end of this
carpet, and motioned to the spendthrift to seat himself with his basket
at the other end; then--
NA
NA
NA
Carpet! to bear us over hill and valley, over lake and river, to that
NA
away flew the carpet, swifter than the swiftest wind, carrying the old
man and the young spendthrift, until at last it brought them to a rocky
desert without leaf or blade of grass to be seen far or near. Then it
descended to where there was a circle of sand as smooth as a floor.
The old man rolled up the carpet, and then drew from a pouch that hung
at his side a box, and from the box some sticks of sandal and spice
woods, with which he built a little fire. Next he drew from the same
pouch a brazen jar, from which he poured a gray powder upon the blaze.
Instantly there leaped up a great flame of white light and a cloud of
smoke, which rose high in the air, and there spread out until it hid
everything from sight. Then the old man began to mutter spells, and in
answer the earth shook and quaked, and a rumbling as of thunder filled
the air. At last he gave a loud cry, and instantly the earth split open,
and there the young spendthrift saw a trap-door of iron, in which was an
iron ring to lift it by.
NA
you; lift for me that trap-door of iron, for it is too heavy for me to
NA
And it was no small task, either, for, stout and strong as the young man
was, it was all he could do to lift up the iron plate. But at last up
it swung, and down below he saw a flight of stone steps leading into the
earth.
The old man drew from his bosom a copper lamp, which he lit at the fire
of the sandal and spice wood sticks, which had now nearly died away.
Then, leading the way, with the young man following close at his heels,
he descended the stairway that led down below. At the bottom the two
entered a great vaulted room, carved out of the solid stone, upon the
walls of which were painted strange pictures in bright colors of kings
and queens, genii and dragons. Excepting for these painted figures, the
vaulted room was perfectly bare, only that in the centre of the floor
there stood three stone tables. Upon the first table stood an iron
candlestick with three branches; upon the second stood an earthen jar,
empty of everything but dust; upon the third stood a brass bowl, a yard
wide and a yard deep, and filled to the brim with shining, gleaming,
dazzling jewels of all sorts.
NA
promised: I will pay you as never man was paid before for such a task.
Yonder upon those three stone tables are three great treasures: choose

NA

NA
The young man needed no second bidding, but began filling his basket
with both hands, until he had in it as much as he could carry.
Then the old man, taking the iron candlestick and the earthen jar, led
the way up the stairway again. There the young man lowered the iron
trap-door to its place, and so soon as he had done so the other stamped
his heel upon the ground, and the earth closed of itself as smooth and
level as it had been before.
The two sat themselves upon the carpet, the one upon the one end, and
NA
â€œI command thee, O Carpet! to fly over hill and valley, over lake and

Away flew the carpet, and in a little time they were back in the garden
from which they had started upon their journey; and there they
NA
henceforth try to live more wisely than thou hast done heretofore.
I know well who thou art, and how thou hast lived. Shun thy evil
companions, live soberly, and thou hast enough to make thee rich for as
NA
NA
NA
So, filled with good resolves, the young man went the next day to his
creditors and paid his debts; he bought back the house which his father
had left him, and there began to lead a new life as he had promised.
But a gray goose does not become white, nor a foolish man a wise one.
At first he led a life sober enough; but by little and little he began
to take up with his old-time friends again, and by-and-by the money went
flying as merrily as ever, only this time he was twenty times richer
than he had been before, and he spent his money twenty times as fast.
Every day there was feasting and drinking going on in his house, and
roaring and rioting and dancing and singing. The wealth of a king could
not keep up such a life forever, so by the end of a year and a half the
last of the treasure was gone, and the young spendthrift was just as
poor as ever. Then once again his friends left him as they had done
before, and all that he could do was to rap his head and curse his
folly.
At last, one morning, he plucked up courage to go to the old man who had
helped him once before, to see whether he would not help him again. Rap!
tap! tap! he knocked at the door, and who should open it but the old man
NA
NA
the old man listened and stroked his beard.
NA
alone in your folly; for it is plain to see that nothing can cure you of
it. Nevertheless, as you helped me once, and as I have more than I shall
NA
He led the way, the spendthrift following, to a little room all of bare
stone, and in which were only three things--the magic carpet, the iron
candlestick, and the earthen jar. This last the old man gave to the
NA
jewels that day in the cavern, you chose the less for the greater. Here
is a treasure that an emperor might well envy you. Whatever you wish for
you will find by dipping your hand into the jar. Now go your way, and
NA
NA
NA
resolves.
The first thing he did when he reached home was to try the virtue of his
NA
NA
the jar, and when he brought it out again it was brimful of shining,
gleaming, sparkling jewels. You can guess how he felt when he saw them.
Well, this time a whole year went by, during which the young man lived
as soberly as a judge. But at the end of the twelvemonth he was so sick
of wisdom that he loathed it as one loathes bitter drink. Then by little
and little he began to take up with his old ways again, and to call his
old cronies around, until at the end of another twelvemonth things were
a hundred times worse and wilder than ever; for now what he had he had
without end.
One day, when he and a great party of roisterers were shouting and
making merry, he brought out his earthen-ware pot to show them the
wonders of it; and to prove its virtue he gave to each guest whatever he
NA
NA
NA
NA
to another, and each and every one got what he asked for, and such a
shouting and hubbub those walls had never heard before.
Then the young man, holding the jar in his hands, began to dance and to
NA
friends clapping their hands, and laughing and cheering him. At last,
in the height of his folly, he balanced the earthen jar on his head, and
began dancing around and around with it to show his dexterity.
Smash! crash! The precious jar lay in fifty pieces of the stone floor,
and the young man stood staring at the result of his folly with bulging
eyes, while his friends roared and laughed and shouted louder than ever
over his mishap. And again his treasure and his gay life were gone.
But what had been hard for him to do before was easier now. At the end
of a week he was back at the old manâ€™s house, rapping on the door.
This time the old man asked him never a word, but frowned as black as
thunder.
NA
let you alone in your folly; but once more I will have pity on you and
NA
the way to the stone room, where were the iron candlestick and the
magic carpet, and with him he took a good stout cudgel. He stood the
candlestick in the middle of the room, and taking three candles from his
pouch, thrust one into each branch. Then he struck a light, and lit the
first candle. Instantly there appeared a little old man, clad in a long
white robe, who began dancing and spinning around and around like a top.
He lit the second candle, and a second old man appeared, and round and
round he went, spinning like his brother. He lit the third candle, and
a third old man appeared. Around and around and around they spun and
whirled, until the head spun and whirled to look at them. Then the old
NA
NA
another word, the graybeard fetched each of the dancers a blow upon the
head with might and main--One! two! three! crack! crash! jingle!
Lo and behold! Instead of the three dancing men, there lay three great
heaps of gold upon the floor, and the spendthrift stood staring like an

NA

this is the most wonderful! But how am I to carry my gold away with me,

The spendthrift was left all alone in the room; not a soul was there
but himself. He looked up, and he looked down, and scratched his head.
NA
NA
To do was as easy as to say. He snatched up the iron candlestick, caught
up the staff that the old man had left leaning against the wall, and
NA
â€œI command thee, O Carpet! to carry me over hill and valley, over lake
NA
Hardly had the words left his mouth than away flew the carpet through
the air, carrying him along with it; away and away, higher than the
clouds and swifter than the wind. Then at last it descended to the earth
again, and when the young spendthrift looked about him, he found himself
in just such a desert place as he and the old man had come to when
they had found the treasure. But he gave no thought to that, and hardly
looked around him to see where he was. All that he thought of was to
try his hand at the three dancers that belonged to the candlestick.
He struck a light, and lit the three candles, and instantly the three
little old men appeared for him just as they had for the old graybeard.
And around and around they spun and whirled, until the sand and dust
spun and whirled along with them. Then the young man grasped his cudgel
tightly.
Now, he had not noticed that when the old man struck the three dancers
he had held the cudgel in his left hand, for he was not wise enough
to know that great differences come from little matters. He griped the
cudgel in his right hand, and struck the dancers with might and main,
just as the old man had done. Crack! crack! crack! one; two; three.
Did they change into piles of gold? Not a bit of it! Each of the dancers
drew from under his robe a cudgel as stout and stouter than the one the
young man himself held, and, without a word, fell upon him and began to
beat and drub him until the dust flew. In vain he hopped and howled and
begged for mercy, in vain he tried to defend himself; the three never
stopped until he fell to the ground, and laid there panting and sighing
and groaning; and then they left and flew back with the iron candlestick
and the magic carpet to the old man again. At last, after a great while,
the young spendthrift sat up, rubbing the sore places; but when he
looked around not a sign was to be seen of anything but the stony
desert, without a house or a man in sight.
Perhaps, after a long time, he found his way home again, and perhaps
the drubbing he had had taught him wisdom; the first is a likely enough
thing to happen, but as for the second, it would need three strong men
to tell it to me a great many times before I would believe it.
You may smile at this story if you like, but, all the same, as certainly
as there is meat in an egg-shell, so is there truth in this nonsense.

The Good of a Few Words
There was one Beppo the Wise and another Beppo the Foolish.
The wise one was the father of the foolish one.
Beppo the Wise was called Beppo the Wise because he had laid up a great
treasure after a long life of hard work.
Beppo the Foolish was called Beppo the Foolish because he spent in five
years after his father was gone from this world of sorrow all that the
old man had laid together in his long life of toil. But during that time
Beppo lived as a prince, and the life was never seen in that town before
or since--feasting and drinking and junketing and merrymaking. He had
friends by the dozen and by the scores, and the fame of his doings went
throughout all the land.
While his money lasted he was called Beppo the Generous. It was only
after it was all gone that they called him Beppo the Foolish.
So by-and-by the money was spent, and there was an end of it.
Yes; there was an end of it; and where were all of Beppoâ€™s fair-weather
friends? Gone like the wild-geese in frosty weather.
NA
NA
But the fair-weather friend only laughed in his face.
â€œDonâ€™t you remember how I gave you a fine gold chain with a diamond
NA
NA
But the summer-goose friend only grinned.
NA
third.
NA
NA
Then poor Beppo saw that there was not place for him in that town, and
so off he went to seek his fortune else whither, for he saw that there
was nothing to be gained in that place.
So he journeyed on for a week and a day, and then towards evening he
came to the kingâ€™s town.
There it stood on the hill beside the river--the grandest city in the
kingdom. There were orchards and plantations of trees along the banks
of the stream, and gardens and summer-houses and pavilions. There were
white houses and red roofs and blue skies. Up above on the hill were
olive orchards and fields, and then blue sky again.
Beppo went into the town, gazing about him with admiration. Houses,
palaces, gardens. He had never seen the like. Stores and shops full
of cloths of velvet and silk and satin; goldsmiths, silversmiths,
jewellers--as though all the riches of the world had been emptied into
the city. Crowds of people--lords, noblemen, courtiers, rich merchants,
and tradesmen.
Beppo stared about at the fine sights and everybody stared at Beppo, for
his shoes were dusty, his clothes were travel-stained, and a razor had
not touched his face for a week.
The king of that country was walking in the garden under the shade of
the trees, and the sunlight slanted down upon him, and sparkled upon the
jewels around his neck and on his fingers. Two dogs walked alongside
of him, and a whole crowd of lords and nobles and courtiers came behind
him; first of all the prime-minister with his long staff.
But for all this fine show this king was not really the king. When the
old king died he left a daughter, and she should have been queen if she
had had her own rights. But this king, who was her uncle, had stepped in
before her, and so the poor princess was pushed aside and was nobody at
all but a princess, the kingâ€™s niece.
She stood on the terrace with her old nurse, while the king walked in
the garden below.
It had been seven years now since the old king had died, and in that
time she had grown up into a beautiful young woman, as wise as she was
beautiful, and as good as she was wise. Few people ever saw her, but
everybody talked about her in whispers and praised her beauty and
goodness, saying that, if the right were done, she would have her own
and be queen.
Sometimes the king heard of this (for a king hears everything), and he
grew to hate the princess as a man hates bitter drink.
The princess looked down from the terrace, and there she saw Beppo
walking along the street, and his shoes were dusty and his clothes were
travel-stained, and a razor had not touched his face for a week.
NA
NA
The king, walking below in the garden, heard what she said.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Beppo was walking along the street looking about him hither and thither,
and thinking how fine it all was. He had no more thought that the king
and the princess were talking about him than the man in the moon.
Suddenly some one clapped him upon the shoulder.
Beppo turned around.
There stood a great tall man dressed all in black.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
So he turned and followed the man whither he led.
They went along first one street and then another, and by-and-by they
came to the river, and there was a long wall with a gate in it. The tall
man in black knocked upon the gate, and some one opened it from within.
The man in black entered, and Beppo followed at his heels, wondering
where he was going.
He was in a garden. There were fruit trees and flowering shrubs and long
marble walks, and away in the distance a great grand palace of white
marble that shone red as fire in the light of the setting sun, but there
was not a soul to be seen anywhere.
The tall man in black led the way up the long marble walk, past the
fountains and fruit trees and beds of roses, until he had come to the
palace.
Beppo wondered whether he were dreaming.
The tall man in black led the way into the palace, but still there was
not a soul to be seen.
Beppo gazed about him in wonder. There were floors of colored marble,
and ceilings of blue and gold, and columns of carved marble, and
hangings of silk and velvet and silver.
Suddenly the tall man opened a little door that led into a dark passage,
and Beppo followed him. They went along the passage, and then the man
opened another door.
Then Beppo found himself in a great vaulted room. There at one end of
the room were three souls. A man sat on the throne, and he was the
king, for he had a crown on his head and a long robe over his shoulders.
Beside him stood a priest, and in front of him stood a beautiful young
woman as white as wax and as still as death.
Beppo wondered whether he were awake.
NA
NA
king.
Beppo did as he was bidden.
Her hand was as cold as ice.
Then, before Beppo knew what was happening, he found that he was being
married.
It was the princess.
NA
until his brows were as black as thunder--â€œnow you are married; tell me,
NA
But the princess said never a word, only the tears ran one after another
down her white face. The king sat staring at her and frowning.
Suddenly some one tapped Beppo upon the shoulder. It was the tall man in
black.
Beppo knew that he was to follow him again. This time the princess
was to go along. The tall man in black led the way, and Beppo and the
princess followed along the secret passage and up and down the stairs
until at last they came out into the garden again.
And now the evening was beginning to fall.
The man led the way down the garden to the river, and still Beppo and
the princess followed him.
By-and-by they came to the river-side and to a flight of steps, and
there was a little frail boat without sail or oars.
The tall man in black beckoned towards the boat, and Beppo knew that he
and princess were to enter it.
As soon as Beppo had helped the princess into the boat the tall man
thrust it out into the stream with his foot, and the boat drifted away
from the shore and out into the river, and then around and around. Then
it floated off down the stream.
It floated on and on, and the sun set and the moon rose.
Beppo looked at the princess, and he thought he had never seen any one
so beautiful in all his life. It was all like a dream, and he hoped he
might never waken. But the princess sat there weeping and weeping, and
said nothing.
The night fell darker and darker, but still Beppo sat looking at the
princess. Her face was as white as silver in the moonlight. The smell
of the flower-gardens came across the river. The boat floated on and on
until by-and-by it drifted to the shore again and among the river reeds,
and there it stopped, and Beppo carried the princess ashore.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Beppo could not believe his ears.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Some little distance away from the river was the twinkle of a light, and
thither Beppo led the princess. When the two came to it, they found
it was a little hut, for there were fish-nets hanging outside in the
moonlight.
Beppo knocked.
An old woman opened the door. She stared and stared, as well she might,
to see the fine lady in silks and satins with a gold ring upon her
finger, and nobody with her but one who looked like a poor beggar-man.

NA

Then Beppo and the princess went into the house.
NA
a ring and a letter. Go you into the town and inquire for Sebastian the
NA
Beppo took the ring and the letter and started off to town, and it
was not hard for him to find the man he sought, for every one knew of
Sebastian the Goldsmith. He was an old man, with a great white beard and
a forehead like the dome of a temple. He looked at Beppo from head to
foot with eyes as bright as those of a snake; then he took the ring
and the letter. As soon as he saw the ring he raised it to his lips and
kissed it; then he kissed the letter also; then he opened it and read
it.
NA
NA
He led the way into an inner room. There were soft rugs upon the floor,
and around the walls were tapestries. There were couches and silken
cushions. Beppo wondered what it all meant.
Sebastian the Goldsmith clapped his hands together. A door opened, and
there came three black slaves into the room. The Goldsmith spoke to them
in a strange language, and the chief of the three black slaves bowed in
reply. Then he and the others led Beppo into another room where there
was a marble bath of tepid water. They bathed him and rubbed him with
soft linen towels; then they shaved the beard from his cheeks and chin
and trimmed his hair; then they clothed him in fine linen and a plain
suit of gray and Beppo looked like a new man.
Then when all this was done the chief of the blacks conducted Beppo back
to Sebastian the Goldsmith. There was a fine feast spread, with fruit
and wine. Beppo sat down to it, and Sebastian the Goldsmith stood and
served him with a napkin over his arm.
Then Beppo was to return to the princess again.
A milk-white horse was waiting for him at the Goldsmithâ€™s door, a
servant holding the bridle, and Beppo mounted and rode away.
When he returned to the fishermanâ€™s hut the princess was waiting for
him. She had prepared a tray spread with a napkin, a cup of milk, and
some sweet cakes.
NA

the chase. Offer him this refreshment. He will eat and drink, and in
gratitude he will offer you something in return. Take nothing of him,
but ask him this: that he allow you once every three days to come to the
palace, and that he whisper these words in your ear so that no one else
may hear them--â€˜A word, a word, only a few words; spoken ill, they are
NA
NA
NA
Beppo did not understand it at all, but the princess is a princess and
must be obeyed, and so he rode away on his horse at her bidding.
It was as the princess had said: the king was hunting in the forest,
and when Beppo came there he could hear the shouts of the men and the
winding of horns and the baying of dogs. He waited there for maybe an
hour or more, and sometimes the sounds were nearer and sometimes the
sounds were farther away. Presently they came nearer and nearer, and
then all of a sudden the king came riding out of the forest, the hounds
hunting hither and thither, and the lords and nobles and courtiers
following him.
The kingâ€™s face was flushed and heated with the chase, and his forehead
was bedewed with sweat. Beppo came forward and offered the tray. The
king wiped his face with the napkin, and then drank the milk and ate
three of the cakes.
NA
NA
The king looked at Beppo and was grateful to him.
NA
NA
NA

me aside and will whisper these words into my ear so that no one else
may hear them--A word, a word, only a few words; spoken ill, they are

NA

NA
NA
he rode away.
The next morning the princess said to Beppo: â€œThis day you shall go and
claim the kingâ€™s promise of him. Take this ring and this letter again to
Sebastian the Goldsmith. He will fit you with clothes in which to appear
before the king. Then go to the kingâ€™s palace that he may whisper those
NA
Once more Beppo went to Sebastian the Goldsmith, and the Goldsmith
kissed the princessâ€™s ring and letter, and read what she had written.
Again the black slaves took Beppo to the bath, only this time they clad
him in a fine suit of velvet and hung a gold chain around his neck.
After that Sebastian the Goldsmith again served a feast to Beppo, and
waited upon him while he ate and drank.
In front of the house a noble horse, as black as jet, was waiting to
carry Beppo to the palace, and two servants dressed in velvet livery
were waiting to attend him.
So Beppo rode away, and many people stopped to look at him.
He came to the palace, and the king was giving audience. Beppo went into
the great audience-chamber. It was full of people--lords and nobles and
rich merchants and lawyers.
Beppo did not know how to come to the king, so he stood there and waited
and waited. The people looked at him and whispered to one another: â€œWho

the young man who served the king with cakes and milk in the forest

Beppo stood there gazing at the king. By-and-by the king suddenly looked
up and caught sight of him. He gazed at Beppo for a moment or two and
then he knew him. Then he smiled and beckoned to him.
NA

NA
Beppo came forward, and everybody stared. He came close to the king, and
the king laid his hand upon his shoulder. Then he leaned over to Beppo
and whispered in his ear: â€œA word, a word, only a few words; if they be
spoken ill, they are ill; if they be spoken well, they are more precious
NA
NA
NA
But, lo and behold, what a change!
Suddenly he was transformed in the eyes of the whole world. The crowd
drew back to allow him to pass, and everybody bowed low as he went
along.
NA
NA
third.
He had come into the palace Beppo the Foolish; he went forth Beppo the
Great Man, and all because of a few words the king had whispered in his
ear.
Three days passed, and then Beppo went again to the Goldsmithâ€™s with the
ring and a letter from the princess. This time Sebastian the Goldsmith
fitted him with a suit of splendid plum-colored silk and gave him a
dappled horse, and again Beppo and his two attendants rode away to the
palace. And this time every one knew him, and as he went up the steps
into the palace all present bowed to him. The king saw him as soon as he
appeared, and when he caught sight of him he burst out laughing.
NA
NA
Then all the lords and nobles and courtiers and ministers drew back, and
Beppo went up to the king.
The king laughed and laughed. He laid his arm over Beppoâ€™s shoulder,
and again he whispered in his ear: â€œA word, a word, only a few words; if
they be spoken ill, they are ill; if they be spoken well, they are more
NA
Then he released Beppo, and Beppo withdrew.
So it continued for three months. Every three days Beppo went to the
palace, and the king whispered the words in his ear. Beppo said nothing
to any one, and always went away as soon as the king had whispered to
him.
Then at last the princess said to him: â€œNow the time is ripe for doing.
Listen! To-day when you go to the palace fix your eyes, when the
king speaks to you, upon the prime-minister, and shake your head. The
prime-minister will ask you what the king said. Say nothing to him but

It was all just as the princess had said.
The king was walking in the garden, with his courtiers and ministers
about him. Beppo came to him, and the king, as he always did, laid his
hand upon Beppoâ€™s shoulder and whispered in his ear: â€œA word, a word,
only a few words; if they be spoken ill, they are ill; if they be spoken
NA
While the king was saying these words to Beppo, Beppo was looking
fixedly at the prime-minister. While he did so he shook his head three
times. Then he bowed low and walked away.
He had not gone twenty paces before some one tapped him upon the arm;
it was the prime-minister. Beppo gazed fixedly at him. â€œAlas, my poor

The prime-minister still followed him.

Three days passed.

Again all happened just as the princess said.
Beppo came to the palace, and again the king whispered in his ear. As
he did so Beppo looked at the prime-minister and smiled, and then he
withdrew.
NA
NA
NA
â€œhow can I express my gratitude! The palace of my son that stands by the
river--I would that you would use it for your own, if I may be so bold
NA
NA
The prime-minister wrung his hand again, and then Beppo rode away.
The next time that Beppo spoke to the king, at the princessâ€™s bidding,
he looked at the lord-treasurer, and said, as he had said to the
NA
When he rode away he left the lord-treasurer as white as ashes to the
very lips.
Three days passed, and then, while the king talked to Beppo, Beppo
looked at the lord-treasurer and smiled.
The lord-treasurer followed him to the door of the palace.
NA
The treasurer offered him a fortune.
The next time it was the same with the captain of the guards. First
Beppo pitied him, and then he wished him joy.
NA
NA
Then the same thing happened to the governor of the city, then to this
lord, and then to that lord.
Beppo grew rich and powerful beyond measure.
Then one day the princess said: â€œNow we will go into the town, and to
the palace of the prime-ministerâ€™s son, which the prime-minister gave

In a few days all the court knew that Beppo was living like a prince in
the prime-ministerâ€™s palace. The king began to wonder what it all meant,
and how all such good-fortune had come to Beppo. He had grown very tired
of always speaking to Beppo the same words.
But Beppo was now great among the great; all the world paid court to
him, and bowed down to him, almost as they did before the king.

Beppo did as she bade. He asked all of the great people of the kingdom
to come to him, and they came. When they were all gathered together at
Beppoâ€™s house, they found two thrones set as though for a king and a
queen, but there was no sign of Beppo, and everybody wondered what it
all meant.
Suddenly the door opened and Beppo came into the room, leading by the
hand a lady covered with a veil from head to foot.
Everybody stopped speaking and stood staring while Beppo led the veiled
lady up to one of the thrones. He seated himself upon the other.
The lady stood up and dropped her veil, and then every one knew her.

All stood silent for a moment, and then a great shout went up. â€œLong

The princess turned to the captain of the guards. â€œYou have offered your

Womanâ€™s Wit.
When manâ€™s strength fails, womanâ€™s wit prevails.
In the days when the great and wise King Solomon lived and ruled, evil
spirits and demons were as plentiful in the world as wasps in summer.
So King Solomon, who was so wise and knew so many potent spells that he
had power over evil such as no man has had before or since, set himself
to work to put those enemies of mankind out of the way. Some he conjured
into bottles, and sank into the depths of the sea; some he buried in
the earth; some he destroyed altogether, as one burns hair in a
candle-flame.
Now, one pleasant day when King Solomon was walking in his garden with
his hands behind his back, and his thoughts busy as bees with this or
that, he came face to face with a Demon, who was a prince of his kind.
NA
the wise King Solomon who conjures my brethren into brass chests and
glass bottles? Come, try a fall at wrestling with me, and whoever
conquers shall be master over the other for all time. What do you say to
NA
NA
off his royal robes and stood bare breasted, man to man with the other.
The world never saw the like of that wrestling match betwixt the king
and the Demon, for they struggled and strove together from the seventh
hour in the morning to the sunset in the evening, and during that time
the sky was clouded over as black as night, and the lightning forked
and shot, and the thunder roared and bellowed, and the earth shook and
quaked.
But at last the king gave the enemy an under twist, and flung him down
on the earth so hard that the apples fell from the trees; and then,
panting and straining, he held the evil one down, knee on neck.
Thereupon the sky presently cleared again, and all was as pleasant as a
spring day.
King Solomon bound the Demon with spells, and made him serve him for
seven years. First, he had him build a splendid palace, the like of
which was not to be seen within the bounds of the seven rivers; then he
made him set around the palace a garden, such as I for one wish I may
see some time or other. Then, when the Demon had done all that the king
wished, the king conjured him into a bottle, corked it tightly, and set
the royal seal on the stopper. Then he took the bottle a thousand miles
away into the wilderness, and, when no man was looking, buried it in the
ground, and this is the way the story begins.
Well, the years came and the years went, and the world grew older and
older, and kept changing (as all things do but two), so that by-and-by
the wilderness where King Solomon had hid the bottle became a great
town, with people coming and going, and all as busy as bees about their
own business and other folksâ€™ affairs.
Among these towns-people was a little Tailor, who made clothes for many
a worse man to wear, and who lived all alone in a little house with no
one to darn his stockings for him, and no one to meddle with his coming
and going, for he was a bachelor.
The little Tailor was a thrifty soul, and by hook and crook had laid by
enough money to fill a small pot, and then he had to bethink himself of
some safe place to hide it. So one night he took a spade and a lamp and
went out in the garden to bury his money. He drove his spade into the
ground--and click! He struck something hard that rang under his foot
NA
he had known as much as you and I do, he would have filled in the earth,
and tramped it down, and have left that plate of broth for somebody else
to burn his mouth with.
As it was, he scraped away the soil, and then he found a box of adamant,
with a ring in the lid to lift it by. The Tailor clutched the ring and
bent his back, and up came the box with the damp earth sticking to it.
He cleaned the mould away, and there he saw, written in red letters,
these words:
NA
You may be sure that after he had read these words he was not long in
breaking open the lid of the box with his spade.
Inside the first box he found a second, and upon it the same words:
NA
Within the second box was another, and within that still another, until
there were seven in all, and on each was written the same words:
NA
Inside the seventh box was a roll of linen, and inside that a bottle
filled with nothing but blue smoke; and I wish that bottle had burned
the Tailorâ€™s fingers when he touched it.
NA
down and shaking it, and peeping at it by the light of the lamp. â€œWell,
since I have gone so far I might as well open it, as I have already
NA
Pop! out flew the cork, and--puff! out came the smoke; not all at once,
but in a long thread that rose up as high as the stars, and then spread
until it hid their light.
The Tailor stared and goggled and gaped to see so much smoke come out of
such a little bottle, and, as he goggled and stared, the smoke began to
gather together again, thicker and thicker, and darker and darker, until
it was as black as ink. Then out from it there stepped one with eyes
that shone like sparks of fire, and who had a countenance so terrible
that the Tailorâ€™s skin quivered and shrivelled, and his tongue clove to
the roof of his mouth at the sight of it.
NA
marrow of the poor Tailorâ€™s bones turn soft from terror.
NA
NA
â€œthat one little tailor can undo in a moment that which took the wise
Solomon a whole day to accomplish, and in the doing of which he wellnigh

NA
I lay there in that bottle, and no one came nigh to aid me. Thou hast
liberated me, and thou shalt not go unrewarded. Every morning at the
seventh hour I will come to thee, and I will perform for thee whatever
task thou mayst command me. But there is one condition attached to
the agreement, and woe be to thee if that condition is broken. If any
morning I should come to thee, and thou hast no task for me to do, I

 Thereupon he was gone in an instant, leaving the little Tailor half dead
with terror.
Now it happened that the prime-minister of that country had left an
order with the Tailor for a suit of clothes, so the next morning, when
the Demon came, the little man set him to work on the bench, with his
NA
NA
NA
in the air, and cutting most wonderful patterns of silks and satins out
of nothing at all, and the little Tailor sat and gaped and stared. Then
the Demon began to drive the needle like a spark of fire--the like was
never seen in all the seven kingdoms, for the clothes seemed to make
themselves.
At last, at the end of a little while, the Demon stood up and brushed
NA
vanished. But the Tailor cared little for that, for upon the bench there
lay such a suit of clothes of silk and satin stuff, sewed with threads
of gold and silver and set with jewels, as the eyes of man never saw
before; and the Tailor packed them up and marched off with them himself
to the prime-minister.
The prime-minister wore the clothes to court that very day, and before
evening they were the talk of the town. All the world ran to the Tailor
and ordered clothes of him, and his fortune was made. Every day the
Demon created new suits of clothes out of nothing at all, so that the
Tailor grew as rich as a Jew, and held his head up in the world.
As time went along he laid heavier and heavier tasks upon the Demonâ€™s
back, and demanded of him more and more; but all the while the Demon
kept his own counsel, and said never a word.
One morning, as the Tailor sat in his shop window taking the world
easy--for he had little or nothing to do now--he heard a great hubbub in
the street below, and when he looked down he saw that it was the kingâ€™s
daughter passing by. It was the first time that the Tailor had seen her,
and when he saw her his heart stood still within him, and then began
fluttering like a little bird, for one so beautiful was not to be met
with in the four corners of the world. Then she was gone.
All that day the little Tailor could do nothing but sit and think of the
princess, and the next morning when the Demon came he was thinking of
her still.
NA
of a morning.
The little Tailor was waiting for the question.
NA
NA
NA
hands together like a clap of thunder, and instantly the walls of the
room clove asunder, and there came out four-and-twenty handsome youths,
clad in cloth of gold and silver. After these four-and-twenty there came
another one who was the chief of them all, and before whom, splendid as
they were, the four-and-twenty paled like stars in daylight. â€œGo to the
NA
The Tailor of Tailors, the Master of Masters, and One Greater than a
NA
NA
earth.
Never was there such a hubbub in the town as when those five-and-twenty,
in their clothes of silver and gold, rode through the streets to the
kingâ€™s palace. As they came near, the gates of the palace flew open
before them, and the king himself came out to meet them. The leader
of the five-and-twenty leaped from his horse, and, kissing the ground
before the king, delivered his message: â€œThe Tailor of Tailors, the
Master of Masters, and One Greater than a King asks for thy daughter to
NA
When the king heard what the messenger said, he thought and pondered
a long time. At last he said, â€œIf he who sent you is the Master of
Masters, and greater than a king, let him send me an asking gift such as
NA
NA
five-and-twenty rode away as they had come, followed by crowds of
people.
The next morning when the Demon came the tailor was ready and waiting
NA
NA
NA
NA
hands together, and summoned, not five-and-twenty young men, but fifty
youths, all clad in clothes more splendid than the others.
All of the fifty sat upon coal-black horses, with saddles of silver and
housings of silk and velvet embroidered with gold. In the midst of all
the five-and-seventy there rode a youth in cloth of silver embroidered
in pearls. In his hand he bore something wrapped in a white napkin, and
that was the present for the king such as no other king could give. So
said the Demon: â€œTake it to the royal palace, and tell his majesty that
it is from the Tailor of Tailors, the Master of Masters, and One Greater
NA
NA
When they came to the palace the gates flew open before them, and
the king came out to meet them. The young man who bore the present
dismounted and prostrated himself in the dust, and, when the king bade
him arise, he unwrapped the napkin, and gave to the king a goblet
made of one single ruby, and filled to the brim with pieces of gold.
Moreover, the cup was of such a kind that whenever it was emptied of its
money it instantly became full again. â€œThe Tailor of Tailors, the Master
of Masters, and One Greater than a King sends your majesty this goblet,
NA
man.
When the king saw what had been sent him he was filled with amazement.
NA
NA
master that he shall have my daughter for his wife if he will build
over yonder a palace such as no man ever saw or no king ever lived in
NA
NA
the others had done the day before.
The next morning when the Demon appeared the Tailor was ready for him.
NA
NA
instantly there came a cloud of mist that covered and hid the spot where
the palace was to be built. Out from the cloud there came such a banging
and hammering and clapping and clattering as the people of that town
never heard before. Then when evening had come the cloud arose, and
there, where the king had pointed out, stood a splendid palace as white
as snow, with roofs and domes of gold and silver. As the king stood
looking and wondering at this sight, there came five hundred young men
riding, and one in the midst of all who wore a golden crown on his head,
NA
 said he, â€œfrom the Tailor of Tailors, and Master of Masters, and One
Greater than a King, to ask you to let him have your daughter for his

NA
NA
The next morning when the Demon came he found the Tailor dancing and
NA
NA
NA
Tailor ready for his wedding. He brought him to a marble bath of water,
in which he washed away all that was coarse and ugly, and from which the
little man came forth as beautiful as the sun. Then the Demon clad
him in the finest linen, and covered him with clothes such as even the
emperor of India never wore. Then he smote his hands together, and the
wall of the tailor-shop opened as it had done twice before, and there
came forth forty slaves clad in crimson, and bearing bowls full of money
in their hands. After them came two leading a horse as white as snow,
with a saddle of gold studded with diamonds and rubies and emeralds
and sapphires. After came a body-guard of twenty warriors clad in gold
armor. Then the Tailor mounted his horse and rode away to the kingâ€™s
palace, and as he rode the slaves scattered the money amongst the crowd,
who scrambled for it and cheered the Tailor to the skies.
That night the princess and the Tailor were married, and all the town
was lit with bonfires and fireworks. The two rode away in the midst of
a great crowd of nobles and courtiers to the palace which the Demon had
built for the Tailor; and, as the princess gazed upon him, she thought
that she had never beheld so noble and handsome a man as her husband. So
she and the Tailor were the happiest couple in the world.
But the next morning the Demon appeared as he had appeared ever since
the Tailor had let him out of the bottle, only now he grinned till his
NA
 said he, and at the words the Tailorâ€™s heart began to quake, for he
remembered what was to happen to him when he could find the Demon no
more work to do--that his neck was to be wrung--and now he began to see
that he had all that he could ask for in the world. Yes; what was there
to ask for now?
NA
NA
NA
NA
to twitch.
Then the Tailor began to see into what a net he had fallen. He began to
tremble like one in an ague. He turned his eyes up and down, for he
did not know where to look for aid. Suddenly, as he looked out of the
NA
NA
thought of something for you to do. Make me out yonder in front of my
palace a lake of water a mile long and a mile wide, and let it be
lined throughout with white marble, and filled with water as clear as
NA
NA
and instantly a thick fog arose from the earth and hid everything from
sight. Then presently from the midst of the fog there came a great
noise of chipping and hammering, of digging and delving, of rushing and
gurgling. All day the noise and the fog continued, and then at sunset
the one ceased and the other cleared away. The poor Tailor looked out
the window, and when he saw what he saw his teeth chattered in his head,
for there was a lake a mile long and a mile broad, lined within with
white marble, and filled with water as clear as crystal, and he knew
that the Demon would come the next morning for another task to do.
That night he slept little or none, and when the seventh hour of the
morning came the castle began to rock and tremble, and there stood the
Demon, and his hair bristled and his eyes shone like sparks of fire.
NA
nothing but look at him with a face as white as dough.
NA
NA
he, â€œat the great mountain over yonder; remove it, and make in its place
NA
NA
NA
upon the ground. Instantly the earth began to tremble and quake, and
there came a great rumbling like the sound of thunder. A cloud of
darkness gathered in the sky, until at last all was as black as the
blackest midnight. Then came a roaring and a cracking and a crashing,
such as man never heard before. All day it continued, until the time
of the setting of the sun, when suddenly the uproar ceased, and the
darkness cleared away; and when the Tailor looked out of the window
the mountain was gone, and in its place were fields and orchards and
gardens.
It was very beautiful to see, but when the Tailor beheld it his knees
began to smite together, and the sweat ran down his face in streams. All
that night he walked up and down and up and down, but he could not think
of one other task for the Demon to do.
When the next morning came the Demon appeared like a whirlwind. His
face was as black as ink and smoke, and sparks of fire flew from his
nostrils.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
When the Tailor came to the princess, he flung himself on his face, and
began to weep and wail. The princess asked him what was the matter, and
at last, by dint of question, got the story from him, piece by piece.
When she had it all she began laughing. â€œWhy did you not come to me
NA
NA
NA
NA
The Tailor was full of doubt; nevertheless, as there was nothing better
to do, he took it to the Demon.
NA
NA
NA
When the Demon heard what was the task that the Tailor had set him to do
he laughed aloud; but that was because he did not know. He took the
hair and stroked it between his thumb and finger, and, when he done, it
curled more than ever. Then he looked serious, and slapped it between
his palms, and that did not better matters, for it curled as much as
ever. Then he frowned, and, began beating the hair with his palm upon
his knees, and that only made it worse. All that day he labored and
strove at his task trying to make that one little hair straight, and,
when the sun set, there was the hair just as crooked as ever. Then, as
the great round sun sank red behind the trees, the Demon knew that he
NA
bellowing so dreadfully that all the world trembled.
So ends the story, with only this to say:
Where manâ€™s strength fails, womanâ€™s wit prevails.
For, to my mind, the princess--not to speak of her husband the little
Tailor--did more with a single little hair and her mother wit than King
Solomon with all his wisdom.

neither hath so much as spoken a word of a story for all this time. If

A Piece of Good Luck
There were three students who were learning all that they could. The
first was named Joseph, the second was named John, and the third was
named Jacob Stuck. They studied seven long years under a wise master,
and in that time they learned all that their master had to teach them
of the wonderful things he knew. They learned all about geometry,
they learned all about algebra, they learned all about astronomy, they
learned all about the hidden arts, they learned all about everything,
except how to mend their own hose and where to get cabbage to boil in
the pot.
And now they were to go out into the world to practice what they knew.
The master called the three students to him--the one named Joseph, the
second named John, and the third named Jacob Stuck--and said he to them,
said he: â€œYou have studied faithfully and have learned all that I have
been able to teach you, and now you shall not go out into the world with
nothing at all. See; here are three glass balls, and that is one for
each of you. Their like is not to be found in the four corners of the
world. Carry the balls wherever you go, and when one of them drops to

So the three students went out into the wide world.
Well, they travelled on and on for day after day, each carrying his
glass ball with him wherever he went. They travelled on and on for I
cannot tell how long, until one day the ball that Joseph carried slipped
NA
NA
The three students fell to work scratching and digging where the ball
had fallen, and by-and-by they found something. It was a chest with an
iron ring in the lid. It took all three of them to haul it up out of
the ground, and when they did so they found it was full to the brim of
silver money.
Were they happy? Well, they were happy! They danced around and around
the chest, for they had never seen so much money in all their lives
NA
hands, and it shall be share and share alike with us, for havenâ€™t we
NA
happy as happy could be.
But by-and-by a flock of second thoughts began to buzz in the heads
NA
chest of silver money is a great thing for three students to find who
had nothing better than book-learning to help them along; but who knows
but that there is something better even than silver money out in the
NA
they had found, the two of them were for going on to try their fortunes
a little farther. And as for Joseph, why, after all, when he came to
think of it, he was not sorry to have his chest of silver money all to
himself.
So the two travelled on and on for a while, here and there and
everywhere, until at last it was Johnâ€™s ball that slipped out of his
fingers and fell to the ground. They digged where it fell, and this time
it was a chest of gold money they found.
Yes, a chest of gold money! A chest of real gold money! They just stood
and stared and stared, for if they had not seen it they would not have
believed that such a thing could have been in the world. â€œWell, Jacob
NA
did, was it not? What is a chest of silver money to such a treasure as
this? Come, brother, here is enough to make us both rich for all the
NA
But no; by-and-by Jacob Stuck began to cool down again, and now that
second thoughts were coming to him he would not even be satisfied with a
half-share of a chest of gold money. No; maybe there might be something
better than even a chest full of gold money to be found in the world.
As for John, why, after all, he was just as well satisfied to keep
his treasure for himself. So the two shook hands, and then Jacob Stuck
jogged away alone, leaving John stuffing his pockets and his hat full of
gold money, and I should have liked to have been there, to have had my
share.
Well, Jacob Stuck jogged on and on by himself, until after a while he
came to a great, wide desert, where there was not a blade or a stick to
be seen far or near. He jogged on and on, and he wished he had not
come there. He jogged on and on when all of a sudden the glass ball he
carried slipped out of his fingers and fell to the ground.
NA
NA
He digged down into the barren earth of the desert; and he digged and he
digged, but neither silver nor gold did he find. He digged and digged;
and by-and-by, at last, he did find something. And what was it? Why,
nothing but something that looked like a piece of blue glass not a
NA
travelled all this weary way and into the blinding desert only for this?
Have I passed by silver and gold enough to make me rich for all my life,
NA
Jacob Stuck did not know what he had found. I shall tell you what it
was. It was a solid piece of good luck without flaw or blemish, and it
was almost the only piece I ever heard tell of. Yes; that was what it
was--a solid piece of good luck; and as for Jacob Stuck, why, he was
not the first in the world by many and one over who has failed to know
a piece of good luck when they have found it. Yes; it looked just like a
piece of blue glass no bigger than my thumb, and nothing else.
NA
way and into the blinding desert only for this? Have I passed by silver
and gold enough to make me rich for all my life, only to find a little

He looked at the bit of glass, and he turned it over and over in his
hand. It was covered with dirt. Jacob Stuck blew his breath upon it, and
rubbed it with his thumb.
Crack! dong! bang! smash!
Upon my word, had a bolt of lightning burst at Jacob Stuckâ€™s feet he
could not have been more struck of a heap. For no sooner had he rubbed
the glass with his thumb than with a noise like a clap of thunder there
instantly stood before him a great, big man, dressed in clothes as red
as a flame, and with eyes that shone sparks of fire. It was the Genie of
Good Luck. It nearly knocked Jacob Stuck off his feet to see him there
so suddenly.
NA
Whosoever holds that piece of crystal in his hand him must I obey in

NA
Jacob Stuck.

NA
desert place, if you can do so, for it is a poor spot for any Christian
NA
NA
had happened to him, the Genie had seized him and was flying with him
through the air swifter than the wind. On and on he flew, and the earth
seemed to slide away beneath. On and on flew the flame-colored Genie
until at last he set Jacob down in a great meadow where there was a
river. Beyond the river were the white walls and grand houses of the
kingâ€™s town.

NA

he, â€œis the purse of fortune; take from it all that thou needest and
yet it will always be full. As long as thou hast it thou shalt never be

NA
So Jacob Stuck went into the town with all the money he could spend, and
such a one is welcome anywhere. He lacked nothing that money could buy.
He bought himself a fine house; he made all the friends he wanted,
and more; he lived without a care, and with nothing to do but to enjoy
himself. That was what a bit of good luck did for him.
Now the princess, the daughter of the king of that town, was the most
beautiful in all the world, but so proud and haughty that her like was
not to be found within the bounds of all the seven rivers. So proud
was she and so haughty that she would neither look upon a young man
nor allow any young man to look upon her. She was so particular that
whenever she went out to take a ride a herald was sent through the
town with a trumpet ordering that every house should be closed and that
everybody should stay within doors, so that the princess should run no
risk of seeing a young man, or that no young man by chance should see
her.
One day the herald went through the town blowing his trumpet and calling
in a great, loud voice: â€œClose your doors! Close your windows! Her
highness, the princess, comes to ride; let no man look upon her on pain
NA
Thereupon everybody began closing their doors and windows, and, as it
was with the others, so it was with Jacob Stuckâ€™s house; it had, like
all the rest, to be shut up as tight as a jug.
But Jacob Stuck was not satisfied with that; not he. He was for seeing
the princess, and he was bound he would do so. So he bored a hole
through the door, and when the princess came riding by he peeped out at
her.
Jacob Stuck thought he had never seen anyone so beautiful in all his
life. It was like the sunlight shining in his eyes, and he almost
sneezed. Her cheeks were like milk and rose-leaves, and her hair like
fine threads of gold. She sat in a golden coach with a golden crown
upon her head, and Jacob Stuck stood looking and looking until his heart
melted within him like wax in the oven. Then the princess was gone, and
Jacob Stuck stood there sighing and sighing.
NA
NA
All that day he sat sighing and thinking about the beautiful princess,
until the evening had come. Then he suddenly thought of his piece of
good luck. He pulled his piece of blue glass out of his pocket and
breathed upon it and rubbed it with his thumb, and instantly the Genie
was there.
This time Jacob Stuck was not frightened at all.
NA
NA
seems to me that there is nobody like her in all the world. Tell me,
NA
NA
NA
feast, and have musicians to play beautiful music, for I would have the
NA
NA
together, and instantly there appeared twenty musicians, dressed in
cloth of gold and silver. With them they brought hautboys and fiddles,
big and little, and flageolets and drums and horns, and this and that to
make music with. Again the Genie smote his hands together, and instantly
there appeared fifty servants dressed in silks and satins and spangled
with jewels, who began to spread a table with fine linen embroidered
with gold, and to set plates of gold and silver upon it. The Genie smote
his hands together a third time, and in answer there came six servants.
They led Jacob Stuck into another room, where there was a bath of musk
and rose-water. They bathed him in the bath and dressed him in clothes
like an emperor, and when he came out again his face shone, and he was
as handsome as a picture.
Then by-and-by he knew that the princess was coming, for suddenly there
was the sound of girlsâ€™ voices singing and the twanging of stringed
instruments. The door flew open, and in came a crowd of beautiful girls,
singing and playing music, and after them the princess herself, more
beautiful than ever. But the proud princess was frightened! Yes, she
was. And well she might be, for the Genie had flown with her through the
air from the palace, and that is enough to frighten anybody. Jacob Stuck
came to her all glittering and shining with jewels and gold, and took
her by the hand. He led her up the hall, and as he did so the musicians
struck up and began playing the most beautiful music in the world. Then
Jacob Stuck and the princess sat down to supper and began eating and
drinking, and Jacob Stuck talked of all the sweetest things he could
think of. Thousands of wax candles made the palace bright as day, and as
the princess looked about her she thought she had never seen anything so
fine in all the world. After they had eaten their supper and ended with
a dessert of all kinds of fruits and of sweetmeats, the door opened and
there came a beautiful young serving-lad, carrying a silver tray, upon
which was something wrapped in a napkin. He kneeled before Jacob Stuck
and held the tray, and from the napkin Jacob Stuck took a necklace of
diamonds, each stone as big as a pigeonâ€™s egg.
NA
NA
Just then the clock struck twelve.
Hardly had the last stroke sounded when every light was snuffed out, and
all was instantly dark and still. Then, before she had time to think,
the Genie of Good Luck snatched the princess up once more and flew back
to the palace more swiftly than the wind. And, before the princess knew
what had happened to her, there she was.
It was all so strange that the princess might have thought it was a
dream, only for the necklace of diamonds, the like of which was not to
be found in all the world.
The next morning there was a great buzzing in the palace, you may be
sure. The princess told all about how she had been carried away during
the night, and had supped in such a splendid palace, and with such
a handsome man dressed like an emperor. She showed her necklace of
diamonds, and the king and his prime-minister could not look at it or
wonder at it enough. The prime-minister and the king talked and talked
the matter over together, and every now and then the proud princess put
in a word of her own.
NA
all magic, or else it is a wonderful piece of good luck. Now, Iâ€™ll tell
NA
chalk by her; and, if she is carried away again in such a fashion, she
shall mark a cross with the piece of chalk on the door of the house to
which she is taken. Then we shall find the rogue that is playing such a
NA
NA
NA
All that day Jacob Stuck sat thinking and thinking about the beautiful
princess. He could not eat a bite, and he could hardly wait for the
night to come. As soon as it had fallen, he breathed upon his piece of
glass and rubbed his thumb upon it, and there stood the Genie of Good
Luck.
NA
NA
NA
And as it had been the night before, so it was now. The Genie brought
the princess, and she and Jacob Stuck feasted together until nearly
midnight. Then, again, the door opened, and the beautiful servant-lad
came with the tray and something upon it covered with a napkin. Jacob
Stuck unfolded the napkin, and this time it was a cup made of a single
ruby, and filled to the brim with gold money. And the wonder of the
cup was this: that no matter how much money you took out of it, it was
NA
the clock struck twelve, and instantly all was darkness, and the Genie
carried the princess home again.
But the princess had brought her piece of chalk with her, as the
prime-minister had advised; and in some way or other she contrived,
either in coming or going, to mark a cross upon the door of Jacob
Stuckâ€™s house.
But, clever as she was, the Genie of Good Luck was more clever still. He
saw what the princess did; and, as soon as he had carried her home, he
went all through the town and marked a cross upon every door, great and
small, little and big, just as the princess had done upon the door of
Jacob Stuckâ€™s house, only upon the prime-ministerâ€™s door he put two
crosses. The next morning everybody was wondering what all the crosses
on the house-doors meant, and the king and the prime-minister were no
wiser than they had been before.
But the princess had brought the ruby cup with her, and she and the king
could not look at it and wonder at it enough.
NA
world but just a piece of good luck--that is all it is. As for the
rogue who is playing all these tricks, let the princess keep a pair of
scissors by her, and, if she is carried away again, let her contrive
to cut off a lock of his hair from over the young manâ€™s right ear. Then
NA
Yes, the princess would do that; so, before evening was come, she tied a
pair of scissors to her belt.
Well, Jacob Stuck could hardly wait for the night to come to summon the
NA
NA
had made everything ready, away he flew to fetch the princess again.
Well, they feasted and drank, and the music played, and the candles were
as bright as day, and beautiful girls sang and danced, and Jacob Stuck
was as happy as a king. But the princess kept her scissors by her, and,
when Jacob Stuck was not looking, she contrived to snip off a lock of
his hair from over his right ear, and nobody saw what was done but the
Genie of Good Luck.
And it came towards midnight.
Once more the door opened, and the beautiful serving-lad came into the
room, carrying the tray of silver with something upon it wrapped in a
napkin. This time Jacob Stuck gave the princess an emerald ring for a
keepsake, and the wonder of it was that every morning two other rings
just like it would drop from it.
Then twelve oâ€™clock sounded, the lights went out, and the Genie took the
princess home again.
But the Genie had seen what the princess had done. As soon as he had
taken her safe home, he struck his palms together and summoned all his
NA
NA
did, from the king himself to the beggar-man at the gates. As for the
prime-minister, the Genie himself trimmed two locks of hair from him,
one from over each of his ears, so that the next morning he looked as
shorn as an old sheep. In the morning all the town was in a hubbub, and
everybody was wondering how all the men came to have their hair clipped
as it was. But the princess had brought the lock of Jacob Stuckâ€™s hair
away with her wrapped up in a piece of paper, and there it was.
As for the ring Jacob Stuck had given to her, why, the next morning
there were three of them, and the king thought he had never heard tell
of such a wonderful thing.
NA
piece of good luck, and not a grain of virtue. Itâ€™s just a piece of good
NA
NA
NA
The prime-minister could think of nothing.
NA
young man for you. Just let the herald go through the town and proclaim
that I will marry the young man to whom this lock of hair belongs, and
NA
NA
who has nothing better than a little bit of good luck to help him along
NA
NA
So the herald was sent out around the town proclaiming that the princess
would marry the man to whose head belonged the lock of hair that she
had.
A lock of hair! Why, every man had lost a lock of hair! Maybe the
princess could fit it on again, and then the fortune of him to whom it
belonged would be made. All the men in the town crowded up to the kingâ€™s
palace. But all for no use, for never a one of them was fitted with his
own hair.
As for Jacob Stuck, he too had heard what the herald had proclaimed.
Yes; he too had heard it, and his heart jumped and hopped within him
like a young lamb in the spring-time. He knew whose hair it was the
princess had. Away he went by himself, and rubbed up his piece of blue
glass, and there stood the Genie.
NA
NA
NA
NA
He smote his hands together, and instantly there appeared a score of
attendants who took Jacob Stuck, and led him into another room, and
began clothing him in a suit so magnificent that it dazzled the eyes to
look at it. He smote his hands together again, and out in the court-yard
there appeared a troop of horsemen to escort Jacob Stuck to the palace,
and they were all clad in gold-and-silver armor. He smote his hands
together again, and there appeared twenty-and-one horses--twenty as
black as night and one as white as milk, and it twinkled and sparkled
all over with gold and jewels, and at the head of each horse of the
one-and-twenty horses stood a slave clad in crimson velvet to hold the
bridle. Again he smote his hands together, and there appeared in the
ante-room twenty handsome young men, each with a marble bowl filled with
gold money, and when Jacob Stuck came out dressed in his fine clothes
there they all were.
Jacob Stuck mounted upon the horse as white as milk, the young
men mounted each upon one of the black horses, the troopers in the
gold-and-silver armor wheeled their horses, the trumpets blew, and away
they rode--such a sight as was never seen in that town before, when they
had come out into the streets. The young men with the basins scattered
the gold money to the people, and a great crowd ran scrambling after,
and shouted and cheered.
So Jacob Stuck rode up to the kingâ€™s palace, and the king himself came
out to meet him with the princess hanging on his arm.
As for the princess, she knew him the moment she laid eyes on him. She
came down the steps, and set the lock of hair against his head, where
she had trimmed it off the night before, and it fitted and matched
NA
NA
But the prime-minister whispered and whispered in the kingâ€™s ear: â€œI
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
shall remove them and build your palace there. When it is finished you
NA
himself, it is something better than mere good luck.
NA
Well, all that day Jacob Stuck feasted and made merry at the kingâ€™s
palace, and the king wondered when he was going to begin to build his
palace. But Jacob Stuck said nothing at all; he just feasted and drank
and made merry. When night had come, however, it was all different. Away
he went by himself, and blew his breath upon his piece of blue glass,
and rubbed it with his thumb. Instantly there stood the Genie before
NA
NA
carried away, and a palace built there of white marble and gold and
silver, such as the world never saw before. And let there be gardens
planted there with flowering plants and trees, and let there be
fountains and marble walks. And let there be servants and attendants
in the palace of all sorts and kinds--men and women. And let there be
a splendid feast spread for to-morrow morning, for then I am going to

NA
All night there was from the sand hills a ceaseless sound as of
thunder--a sound of banging and clapping and hammering and sawing and
calling and shouting. All that night the sounds continued unceasingly,
but at daybreak all was still, and when the sun arose there stood the
most splendid palace it ever looked down upon; shining as white as
snow, and blazing with gold and silver. All around it were gardens and
fountains and orchards. A great highway had been built between it and
the kingâ€™s palace, and all along the highway a carpet of cloth of gold
had been spread for the princess to walk upon.
Dear! Dear! How all the town stared with wonder when they saw such a
splendid palace standing where the day before had been nothing but naked
sand hills! The folk flocked in crowds to see it, and all the country
about was alive with people coming and going. As for the king, he could
not believe his eyes when he saw it. He stood with the princess and
NA
NA
NA
So Jacob Stuck married the princess, and a splendid wedding it was. That
was what a little bit of good luck did for him.
After the wedding was over, it was time to go home to the grand new
palace. Then there came a great troop of horsemen with shining armor and
with music, sent by the Genie to escort Jacob Stuck and the princess and
the king and the prime-minister to Jacob Stuckâ€™s new palace. They rode
along over the carpet of gold, and such a fine sight was never seen
in that land before. As they drew near to the palace a great crowd of
servants, clad in silks and satins and jewels, came out to meet them,
singing and dancing and playing on harps and lutes. The king and the
princess thought that they must be dreaming.
NA
fond of her, he would have given her still more if he could have thought
of anything else.
Jacob Stuck and the princess, and the king and the prime-minister, all
went into the palace, and there was a splendid feast spread in plates of
pure gold and silver, and they all four sat down together.
But the prime-minister was as sour about it all as a crab-apple. All the
time they were feasting he kept whispering and whispering in the kingâ€™s
NA
Stuck to do all this by himself. I tell you, it is all a piece of good

He whispered and whispered, until at last the king up and spoke. â€œTell

he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought out his piece of blue
crystal.

NA
better. It is no common piece of glass, I can tell you. You just breathe
upon it so, and rub your thumb upon it thus, and instantly a Genie
NA
NA
NA
it across the table to the prime-minister to give it to the king.
Yes, that was what he did; he gave it to the prime-minister to give it
to the king. The prime-minister had been listening to all that had been
said, and he knew what he was about. He took what Jacob Stuck gave him,
and he had never had such a piece of luck come to him before.
And did the prime-minister give it to the king, as Jacob Stuck had
intended? Not a bit of it. No sooner had he got it safe in his hand,
than he blew his breath upon it and rubbed it with his thumb.
Crack! dong! boom! crash!
There stood the Genie, like a flash and as red as fire. The princess
screamed out and nearly fainted at the sight, and the poor king sat
trembling like a rabbit.
NA
NA
NA
carry them both away into the farthest part of the desert whence the
NA
NA
king in one hand and Jacob Stuck in the other, and flew away with them
swifter than the wind. On and on he flew, and the earth seemed to slide
away beneath them like a cloud. On and on he flew until he had come to
the farthest part of the desert. There he sat them both down, and it was
as pretty a pickle as ever the king or Jacob Stuck had been in, in all
of their lives. Then the Genie flew back again whence he had come.
There sat the poor princess crying and crying, and there sat the

thought of. I will make myself king. I will conquer the world, and make

But the poor princess cried and cried.
NA

vanished like a puff of smoke.
But the princess cried and cried.
NA
NA
NA
â€œBecause of that piece of blue glass. You will rub it again, and then
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
is not the first man who has thrown aside a piece of good luck for the
NA
NA
it to him. But, instead of doing so, she snatched up the piece of blue
glass as quick as a flash.
NA
his end had come.
She blew her breath upon the piece of blue glass and rubbed her thumb
upon it. Instantly, as with a clap of thunder, the great red Genie stood
before her, and the poor prime-minister sat shaking and trembling.
NA
NA
NA
where you took those other two, and bring my father and Jacob Stuck back
NA
NA
prime-minister, and, in spite of the poor manâ€™s kicks and struggles,
snatched him up and flew away with him swifter than the wind. On and on
he flew until he had come to the farthest part of the desert, and
there sat the king and Jacob Stuck still thinking about things. Down he
dropped the prime-minister, up he picked the king and Jacob Stuck,
and away he flew swifter than the wind. On and on he flew until he had
brought the two back to the palace again; and there sat the princess
waiting for them, with the piece of blue crystal in her hand.
NA
NA
NA
NA
think no more of a piece of good luck than to hand it round like a bit
NA
And there, to my mind, she brewed good common-sense, that needed no
skimming to make it fit for Jacob Stuck, or for any other man, for the
matter of that.
And now for the end of this story. Jacob Stuck lived with his princess
in his fine palace as grand as a king, and when the old king died he
became the king after him.
One day there came two men travelling along, and they were footsore and
weary. They stopped at Jacob Stuckâ€™s palace and asked for something to
eat. Jacob Stuck did not know them at first, and then he did. One was
Joseph and the other was John.
This is what had happened to them:
Joseph had sat and sat where John and Jacob Stuck had left him on his
box of silver money, until a band of thieves had come along and robbed
him of it all. John had carried away his pockets and his hat full of
gold, and had lived like a prince as long as it had lasted. Then he had
gone back for more, but in the meantime some rogue had come along and
had stolen it all. Yes; that was what had happened, and now they were as
poor as ever.
Jacob Stuck welcomed them and brought them in and made much of them.
Well, the truth is truth, and this is it: It is better to have a little
bit of good luck to help one in what one undertakes than to have a chest
of silver or a chest of gold.

Neâ€™thâ€™less, it gives me joy to follow so close so fair and lovely a

The Fruit of Happiness
Once upon a time there was a servant who served a wise man, and cooked
for him his cabbage and his onions and his pot-herbs and his broth, day
after day, time in and time out, for seven years.
In those years the servant was well enough contented, but no one likes
to abide in the same place forever, and so one day he took it into his
head that he would like to go out into the world to see what kind of a
NA
man, the servantâ€™s master; â€œyou have served me faithfully these seven
years gone, and now that you ask leave to go you shall go. But it is
little or nothing in the way of money that I can give you, and so you
will have to be content with what I can afford. See, here is a little
pebble, and its like is not to be found in the seven kingdoms, for
whoever holds it in his mouth can hear while he does so all that the
birds and the beasts say to one another. Take it--it is yours, and, if
NA
The servant would rather have had the money in hand than the magic
pebble, but, as nothing better was to be had, he took the little stone,
and, bidding his master good-bye, trudged out into the world, to seek
his fortune. Well, he jogged on and on, paying his way with the few
pennies he had saved in his seven years of service, but for all of his
travelling nothing of good happened to him until, one morning, he came
to a lonely place where there stood a gallows, and there he sat him down
to rest, and it is just in such an unlikely place as this that a manâ€™s
best chance of fortune comes to him sometimes.
As the servant sat there, there came two ravens flying, and lit upon the
cross-beam overhead. There they began talking to one another, and the
servant popped the pebble into his mouth to hear what they might say.

NA
NA
road over the hill, he would come by-and-by to a stone cross where two
roads meet, and there he would find a man sitting. If he would ask it of
him, that man would lead him to the garden where the fruit of happiness
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhat use? I tell you, friend, there is no fruit in the world like that,
for one has only to hold it in oneâ€™s hand and wish, and whatever one

You may guess that when the servant understood the talk of the ravens he
was not slow in making use of what he heard. Up he scrambled, and away
he went as fast as his legs could carry him. On and on he travelled,
until he came to the cross-roads and the stone cross of which the raven
spoke, and there, sure enough, sat the traveller. He was clad in a
weather-stained coat, and he wore dusty boots, and the servant bade him
good-morning.
How should the servant know that it was an angel whom he beheld, and not
a common wayfarer?
NA
NA
want to know is this--will you guide me to where I can find the fruit of

NA
do ask it, it is not for me to refuse, though I may tell you that many
a man has sought for that fruit, and few indeed have found it. But if
I guide you to the garden where the fruit grows, there is one condition
you must fulfil: many strange things will happen upon our journey
between here and there, but concerning all you see you must ask not a
NA
NA
NA
business in the town to-night, and the time is none too long to get
NA
So all the rest of that day they journeyed onward together, until,
towards evening, they came to a town with high towers and steep roofs
and tall spires. The servantâ€™s companion entered the gate as though
he knew the place right well, and led the way up one street and down
another, until, by-and-by, they came to a noble house that stood a
little apart by itself, with gardens of flowers and fruit-trees all
around it. There the travelling companion stopped, and, drawing out a
little pipe from under his jacket, began playing so sweetly upon it that
he made oneâ€™s heart stand still to listen to the music.
Well, he played and played until, by-and-by, the door opened, and out
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
companion tucked away his pipe and entered, with the other at his heels.
The house-servant led the way from one room to another, each grander
than the one they left behind, until at last he came to a great hall
where dozens of servants were serving a fine feast. But only one man
sat at table--a young man with a face so sorrowful that it made a bodyâ€™s
NA
NA
sorrow. But before I blow my pipe I and my friend here must have
something to eat and drink, for one cannot play well with an empty
NA
NA
So the two did without second bidding, and such food and drink the
serving-man had never tasted in his life before. And while they were
feasting together the young man told them his story, and why it was
he was so sad. A year before he had married a young lady, the most
beautiful in all that kingdom, and had friends and comrades and all
things that a man could desire in the world. But suddenly everything
went wrong; his wife and he fell out and quarrelled until there was
no living together, and she had to go back to her old home. Then his
companions deserted him, and now he lived all alone.
NA
NA
it was such a tune as no man ever listened to before. He played and he
played, and, after a while, one after another of those who listened to
him began to get drowsy. First they winked, then they shut their eyes,
and then they nodded until all were as dumb as logs, and as sound asleep
as though they would never waken again. Only the servant and the piper
stayed awake, for the music did not make them drowsy as it did the rest.
Then, when all but they two were tight and fast asleep, the travelling
companion arose, tucked away his pipe, and, stepping up to the young
man, took from off his finger a splendid ruby ring, as red as blood
and as bright as fire, and popped the same into his pocket. And all the
while the serving-man stood gaping like a fish to see what his comrade
NA
NA
As for the serving-man, though he remembered his promise and said
nothing concerning what he had beheld, his wits buzzed in his head like
a hive of bees, for he thought that of all the ugly tricks he had seen,
none was more ugly than this--to bewitch the poor sorrowful young man
into a sleep, and then to rob him of his ruby ring after he had fed them
so well and had treated them so kindly.
But the next day they jogged on together again until by-and-by they came
to a great forest. There they wandered up and down till night came upon
them and found them still stumbling onward through the darkness, while
the poor serving-manâ€™s flesh quaked to hear the wild beasts and the
wolves growling and howling around them.
But all the while the angel--his travelling companion--said never a
word; he seemed to doubt nothing nor fear nothing, but trudged straight
ahead until, by-and-by, they saw a light twinkling far away, and, when
they came to it, they found a gloomy stone house, as ugly as eyes ever
looked upon. Up stepped the servantâ€™s comrade and knocked upon the
door--rap! tap! tap! By-and-by it was opened a crack, and there stood an
ugly old woman, blear-eyed and crooked and gnarled as a winter twig.
NA
 she cried, â€œwhy do you come here? This is a den where lives a band of
wicked thieves. Every day they go out to rob and murder poor travellers
like yourselves. By-and-by they will come back, and when they find you
NA
NA
NA
And in he went, as he said, with the servant at his heels trembling like
a leaf at what he had heard. The old woman gave them some bread and
meat to eat, and then hid them away in the great empty meal-chest in the
corner, and there they lay as still as mice.
By-and-by in came the gang of thieves with a great noise and uproar,
and down they sat to their supper. The poor servant lay in the chest
listening to all they said of the dreadful things they had done that
day--how they had cruelly robbed and murdered poor people. Every word
that they said he heard, and he trembled until his teeth chattered in
his head. But all the same the robbers knew nothing of the two being
there, and there they lay until near the dawning of the day. Then the
travelling companion bade the servant be stirring, and up they got, and
out of the chest they came, and found all the robbers sound asleep and
snoring so that the dust flew.
NA
NA
As he spoke he drew from his pocket the ruby ring which he had stolen
from the sorrowful young manâ€™s finger, and dropped it into the cup from
which the robber captain drank. Then he led the way out of the house,
and, if the serving-man had wondered the day before at that which the
comrade did, he wondered ten times more to see him give so beautiful a
ring to such wicked and bloody thieves.
The third evening of their journey the two travellers came to a little
hut, neat enough, but as poor as poverty, and there the comrade knocked
upon the door and asked for lodging. In the house lived a poor man and
his wife; and, though the two were as honest as the palm of your hand,
and as good and kind as rain in spring-time, they could hardly scrape
enough of a living to keep body and soul together. Nevertheless, they
made the travellers welcome, and set before them the very best that was
to be had in the house; and, after both had eaten and drunk, they showed
them to bed in a corner as clean as snow, and there they slept the night
through.
But the next morning, before the dawning of the day, the travelling
NA
NA
And strange work it was! When they had come outside of the house, he
gathered together a great heap of straw and sticks of wood, and stuffed
all under the corner of the house. Then he struck a light and set fire
to it, and, as the two walked away through the gray dawn, all was a red
blaze behind them.
Still, the servant remembered his promise to his travelling comrade,
and said never a word or asked never a question, though all that day he
walked on the other side of the road, and would have nothing to say or
to do with the other. But never a whit did his comrade seem to think
of or to care for that. On they jogged, and, by the time evening was at
hand, they had come to a neat cottage with apple and pear trees around
it, all as pleasant as the eye could desire to see. In this cottage
lived a widow and her only son, and they also made the travellers
welcome, and set before them a good supper and showed them to a clean
bed.
This time the travelling comrade did neither good nor ill to those of
the house, but in the morning he told the widow whither they were going,
and asked if she and her son knew the way to the garden where grew the
fruit of happiness.
NA
NA
NA
NA
So the young man put on his hat, and took up his stick, and off went the
three, up hill and down dale, until by-and-by they came over the top of
the last hill, and there below them lay the garden.
And what a sight it was, the leaves shining and glistening like so many
jewels in the sunlight! I only wish that I could tell you how beautiful
that garden was. And in the middle of it grew a golden tree, and on it
golden fruit. The servant, who had travelled so long and so far, could
see it plainly from where he stood, and he did not need to be told that
it was the fruit of happiness. But, after all, all he could do was to
stand and look, for in front of them was a great raging torrent, without
a bridge for a body to cross over.
NA
NA
The travelling companion said never a word, good or bad, but, suddenly
catching the widowâ€™s son by the collar, he lifted him and flung him into
the black, rushing water. Splash! went the young man, and then away he
NA
NA
When the servant saw this cruel, wicked deed, he found his tongue at
last, and all that he had bottled up for the seven days came frothing
out of him like hot beer. Such abuse as he showered upon his travelling
companion no man ever listened to before. But to all the servant said
the other answered never a word until he had stopped for sheer want of
breath. Then--
NA
tongue a minute longer, you, too, would have had the fruit of happiness
in your hand. Now it will be many a day before you have a sight of it
NA
Thereupon, as he ended speaking, he struck his staff upon the ground.
Instantly the earth trembled, and the sky darkened overhead until it
grew as black as night. Then came a great flash of fire from up in the
sky, which wrapped the travelling companion about until he was hidden
from sight. Then the flaming fire flew away to heaven again, carrying
him along with it. After that the sky cleared once more, and, lo and
behold! The garden and the torrent and all were gone, and nothing was
left but a naked plain covered over with the bones of those who had
come that way before, seeking the fruit which the travelling servant had
sought.
It was a long time before the servant found his way back into the world
again, and the first house he came to, weak and hungry, was the widowâ€™s.
But what a change he beheld! It was a poor cottage no longer, but a
splendid palace, fit for a queen to dwell in. The widow herself met him
at the door, and she was dressed in clothes fit for a queen to wear,
shining with gold and silver and precious stones.
The servant stood and stared like one bereft of wits. â€œHow comes all
NA
NA
has brought home from there the fruit of happiness. Many a day did we
search, but never could we find how to enter into the garden, until, the
other day, an angel came and showed the way to my son, and he was able
not only to gather of the fruit for himself, but to bring an apple for

Then the poor travelling servant began to thump his head. He saw well
enough through the millstone now, and that he, too, might have had one
of the fruit if he had but held his tongue a little longer.
Yes, he saw what a fool he had made of himself, when he learned that it
was an angel with whom he had been travelling the five days gone.
But, then, we are all of us like the servant for the matter of that; I,
too, have travelled with an angel many a day, I dare say, and never knew
it.
That night the servant lodged with the widow and her son, and the next
day he started back home again upon the way he had travelled before.
By evening he had reached the place where the house of the poor couple
stood--the house that he had seen the angel set fire to. There he beheld
masons and carpenters hard at work hacking and hewing, and building a
fine new house. And there he saw the poor man himself standing by giving
NA
NA
NA
poor man. â€œI and my wife had lived in our old house for many a long
day, and never knew that a great treasure of silver and gold was hidden
beneath it, until a few days ago there came an angel and burned it down
over our heads, and in the morning we found the treasure. So now we are

The next morning the poor servant jogged along on his homeward way more
sad and downcast than ever, and by evening he had come to the robbersâ€™
den in the thick woods, and there the old woman came running to the door

all dead and gone now, and I use the treasure that they left behind to
entertain poor travellers like yourself. The other day there came an
angel hither, and with him he brought the ring of discord that breeds
spite and rage and quarrelling. He gave it to the captain of the band,
and after he had gone the robbers fought for it with one another until
they were all killed. So now the world is rid of them, and travellers

Back jogged the travelling servant, and the next day came to the town
and to the house of the sorrowful young man. There, lo and behold!
Instead of being dark and silent, as it was before, all was ablaze
with light and noisy with the sound of rejoicing and merriment. There
happened to be one of the household standing at the door, and he knew
the servant as the companion of that one who had stolen the ruby ring.
Up he came and laid hold of the servant by the collar, calling to his
companions that he had caught one of the thieves. Into the house they
hauled the poor servant, and into the same room where he had been
before, and there sat the young man at a grand feast, with his wife
and all his friends around him. But when the young man saw the poor
serving-man he came to him and took him by the hand, and set him beside
himself at the table. â€œNobody except your comrade could be so welcome

that bred strife wherever it came. So, as soon as it was brought
into the house, my wife and all my friends fell out with me, and we
quarrelled so that they all left me. But, though I knew it not at that
time, your comrade was an angel, and took the ring away with him, and

By the next night the servant had come back to his home again. Rap! tap!

And for all I know the travelling servant is there to this day. For he
is not the only one in the world who has come in sight of the fruit of
happiness, and then jogged all the way back home again to cook cabbage
and onions and pot-herbs, and to make broth for wiser men than himself
to sup.
That is the end of this story.

Not a Pin to Choose.
Once upon a time, in a country in the far East, a merchant was
travelling towards the city with three horses loaded with rich goods,
and a purse containing a hundred pieces of gold money. The day was very
hot, and the road dusty and dry, so that, by-and-by, when he reached a
spot where a cool, clear spring of water came bubbling out from under
a rock beneath the shade of a wide-spreading wayside tree, he was glad
enough to stop and refresh himself with a draught of the clear coolness
and rest awhile. But while he stooped to drink at the fountain the purse
of gold fell from his girdle into the tall grass, and he, not seeing it,
let it lie there, and went his way.
Now it chanced that two fagot-makers--the elder by name Ali, the younger
Abdallah--who had been in the woods all day chopping fagots, came also
travelling the same way, and stopped at the same fountain to drink.
There the younger of the two spied the purse lying in the grass, and
picked it up. But when he opened it and found it full of gold money, he
was like one bereft of wits; he flung his arms, he danced, he shouted,
he laughed, he acted like a madman; for never had he seen so much wealth
in all of his life before--a hundred pieces of gold money!
Now the older of the two was by nature a merry wag, and though he had
never had the chance to taste of pleasure, he thought that nothing in
the world could be better worth spending money for than wine and music
and dancing. So, when the evening had come, he proposed that they
two should go and squander it all at the Inn. But the younger
fellow--Abdallah--was by nature just as thrifty as the other was
spendthrift, and would not consent to waste what he had found.
Nevertheless, he was generous and open-hearted, and grudged his friend
nothing; so, though he did not care for a wild life himself, he gave Ali
a piece of gold to spend as he chose.
By morning every copper of what had been given to the elder fagot-maker
was gone, and he had never had such a good time in his life before. All
that day and for a week the head of Ali was so full of the memory of the
merry night that he had enjoyed that he could think of nothing else.
At last, one evening, he asked Abdallah for another piece of gold, and
Abdallah gave it to him, and by the next morning it had vanished in the
same way that the other had flown. By-and-by Ali borrowed a third piece
of money, and then a fourth and then a fifth, so that by the time that
six months had passed and gone he had spent thirty of the hundred pieces
that had been found, and in all that time Abdallah had used not so much
as a pistareen.
But when Ali came for the thirty-and-first loan, Abdallah refused to
let him have any more money. It was in vain that the elder begged and
implored--the younger abided by what he had said.
Then Ali began to put on a threatening front. â€œYou will not let me have
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
fagot-maker by the throat, and began shaking him and shouting, â€œHelp!
NA
hundred men, women, and children were gathered around them in less than
NA
and thievery! Look at this wretch, all good men, and then turn away
your eyes! For twelve years have I lived with this young man as a father
might live with a son, and now how does he repay me? He has stolen all
NA
All this while poor Abdallah had been so amazed that he could do nothing
but stand and stare like one stricken dumb; whereupon all the people,
thinking him guilty, dragged him off to the judge, reviling him and
heaping words of abuse upon him.
NA
but never had he had such a knotty question as this brought up before
him, for by this time Abdallah had found his speech, and swore with a
great outcry that the money belonged to him.
But at last a gleam of light came to the Wise Judge in his perplexity.
NA
NA
His question was one easily enough answered; a score of people were
there to testify that the elder of the two had been living well and
spending money freely for six months and more, and a score were also
there to swear that Abdallah had lived all the while in penury. â€œThen
NA
NA
NA

NA
All who were present shouted with laughter at Abdallahâ€™s speech, for
who would believe that any one would be so generous as to spend all upon
another and none upon himself?
So poor Abdallah was beaten with rods until he confessed where he had
hidden his money; then the Wise Judge handed fifty sequins to Ali and
kept twenty himself for his decision, and all went their way praising
his justice and judgment.
That is to say, all but poor Abdallah; he went to his home weeping and
wailing, and with every one pointing the finger of scorn at him. He was
just as poor as ever, and his back was sore with the beating that he
had suffered. All that night he continued to weep and wail, and when the
morning had come he was weeping and wailing still.
Now it chanced that a wise man passed that way, and hearing his
lamentation, stopped to inquire the cause of his trouble. Abdallah told
the other of his sorrow, and the wise man listened, smiling, till he was
NA

NA
He watched Little Brown Betty until she had filled his mug, and the
froth ran over the top. Then he took a deep draught and began again.
Though Abdallah had affirmed that he did not believe what the wise man
had said, nevertheless the words of the other were a comfort, for it
makes one feel easier in trouble to be told that others have been in a
like case with oneâ€™s self.
So, by-and-by, Abdallah plucked up some spirit, and, saddling his
ass and shouldering his axe, started off to the woods for a bundle of
fagots.
Misfortunes, they say, never come single, and so it seemed to be with
the fagot-maker that day; for that happened that had never happened to
him before--he lost his way in the woods. On he went, deeper and deeper
into the thickets, driving his ass before him, bewailing himself and
rapping his head with his knuckles. But all his sorrowing helped him
nothing, and by the time that night fell he found himself deep in the
midst of a great forest full of wild beasts, the very thought of which
curdled his blood. He had had nothing to eat all day long, and now
the only resting-place left him was the branches of some tree. So,
unsaddling his ass and leaving it to shift for itself, he climbed to and
roosted himself in the crotch of a great limb.
In spite of his hunger he presently fell asleep, for trouble breeds
weariness as it breeds grief.
About the dawning of the day he was awakened by the sound of voices and
the glaring of lights. He craned his neck and looked down, and there he
saw a sight that filled him with amazement: three old men riding each
upon a milk-white horse and each bearing a lighted torch in his hand, to
light the way through the dark forest.
When they had come just below where Abdallah sat, they dismounted and
fastened their several horses to as many trees. Then he who rode first
of the three, and who wore a red cap and who seemed to be the chief of
them, walked solemnly up to a great rock that stood in the hillside,
and, breaking a switch from a shrub that grew in a cleft, struck the
face of the stone, crying in a loud voice, â€œI command thee to open, in
NA
Instantly, creaking and groaning, the face of the rock opened like
a door, gaping blackly. Then, one after another, the three old men
entered, and nothing was left but the dull light of their torches,
shining on the walls of the passage-way.
What happened inside the cavern the fagot-maker could neither see nor
hear, but minute after minute passed while he sat as in a maze at all
that had happened. Then presently he heard a deep thundering voice and
a voice as of one of the old men in answer. Then there came a sound
swelling louder and louder, as though a great crowd of people were
gathering together, and with the voices came the noise of the neighing
of horses and the trampling of hoofs. Then at last there came pouring
from out the rock a great crowd of horses laden with bales and bundles
of rich stuffs and chests and caskets of gold and silver and jewels,
and each horse was led by a slave clad in a dress of cloth-of-gold,
sparkling and glistening with precious gems. When all these had come
out from the cavern, other horses followed, upon each of which sat
a beautiful damsel, more lovely than the fancy of man could picture.
Beside the damsels marched a guard, each man clad in silver armor, and
each bearing a drawn sword that flashed in the brightening day more
keenly than the lightning. So they all came pouring forth from the
cavern until it seemed as though the whole woods below were filled with
the wealth and the beauty of King Solomonâ€™s day--and then, last of all,
came the three old men.
NA
NA
the rock shut as it had opened--like a door--and the three old men,
mounting their horses, led the way from the woods, the others following.
The noise and confusion of the many voices shouting and calling, the
trample and stamp of horses, grew fainter and fainter, until at last
all was once more hushed and still, and only the fagot-maker was left
behind, still staring like one dumb and bereft of wits.
But so soon as he was quite sure that all were really gone, he clambered
down as quickly as might be. He waited for a while to make doubly sure
that no one was left behind, and then he walked straight up to the rock,
just as he had seen the old man do. He plucked a switch from the bush,
just as he had seen the old man pluck one, and struck the stone, just
NA
NA
Instantly, as it had done in answer to the old manâ€™s command, there came
a creaking and a groaning, and the rock slowly opened like a door, and
there was the passageway yawning before him. For a moment or two the
fagot-maker hesitated to enter; but all was as still as death, and
finally he plucked up courage and went within.
By this time the day was brightening and the sun rising, and by the gray
light the fagot-maker could see about him pretty clearly. Not a sign was
to be seen of horses or of treasure or of people--nothing but a square
block of marble, and upon it a black casket, and upon that again a gold
ring, in which was set a blood-red stone. Beyond these things there was
nothing; the walls were bare, the roof was bare, the floor was bare--all
was bare and naked stone.
NA
else, I might as well take these things. The ring is certainly worth
something, and maybe I shall be able to sell the casket for a trifle
NA
NA
NA
creaking and groaning.
After a little while he found his ass, saddled it and bridled it, and
loaded it with the bundle of fagots that he had chopped the day before,
and then set off again to try to find his way out of the thick woods.
But still his luck was against him, and the farther he wandered the
deeper he found himself in the thickets. In the meantime he was like to
die of hunger, for he had not a bite to eat for more than a whole day.
NA
NA
and raised the lid.
Such a yell as the poor wretch uttered ears never heard before. Over
he rolled upon his back and there lay staring with wide eyes, and away
scampered the jackass, kicking up his heels and braying so that the
leaves of the trees trembled and shook. For no sooner had he lifted the
lid than out leaped a great hideous Genie, as black as a coal, with one
fiery-red eye in the middle of his forehead that glared and rolled most
horribly, and with his hands and feet set with claws, sharp and hooked
like the talons of a hawk. Poor Abdallah the fagot-maker lay upon his
back staring at the monster with a face as white as wax.
NA
rumbled like the sound of thunder.

The Genie waved his hand, and in an instant a fine damask napkin lay
spread upon the ground, and upon it a loaf of bread as white as snow and
a piece of cheese such as the king would have been glad to taste. But
Abdallah could do nothing but sit staring at the Genie, for the sight of
the monster quite took away his appetite.

the secret of where I lay hidden. It was they who only this morning
compelled me to give them that vast treasure which thou sawest them take

they made a solemn compact among themselves that I should remain in the
cavern, and that no one of the three should visit it without the other
two in his company. Now, my lord, if it is thy will that I shall enter
the casket again I must even obey thy command in that as in all things;
but, if it please thee, I would fain rejoin my own kind again--they from
whom I have been parted for so long. Shouldst thou permit me to do so
I will still be thy slave, for thou hast only to press the red stone in
the ring and repeat these words: By the red Aldebaran, I command thee
to come,â€™ and I will be with thee instantly. But if I have my freedom

NA

No sooner had the words left his lips than the Genie gave a great cry
of rejoicing, so piercing that it made Abdallahâ€™s flesh creep, and then,
fetching the black casket a kick that sent it flying over the tree tops,
vanished instantly.

crumb he wiped his mouth with the napkin, and, stretching his arms, felt
within him that he was like a new man.
Nevertheless, he was still lost in the woods, and now not even with his
ass for comradeship.
He had wandered for quite a little while before he bethought himself of

NA

Instantly the Genie stood before him--big, black, ugly, and grim. â€œWhat

Hardly were the words out of his mouth when the Genie snatched Abdallah
up, and, flying swifter than the lightning, set him down in the middle
of the highway on the outskirts of the forest before he had fairly
caught his breath.
When he did gather his wits and looked about him, he knew very well
where he was, and that he was upon the road that led to the city. At the
sight his heart grew light within him, and off he stepped briskly for
home again.
But the sun shone hot and the way was warm and dusty, and before
Abdallah had gone very far the sweat was running down his face in
streams. After a while he met a rich husband-man riding easily along on
an ambling nag, and when Abdallah saw him he rapped his head with his

â€œI might just as well have ridden as to have walked, and that upon
a horse a hundred times more beautiful than the one that that fellow

He stepped into the thicket beside the way, where he might be out of
sight, and there pressed the stone in his ring, and at his bidding the
Genie stood before him.
NA
NA
NA
NA
there stood before Abdallah a magnificent Arab horse, with a saddle and
bridle studded with precious stones, and with housings of gold. â€œCan I
NA
NA
NA
The Genie bowed his head and was gone like a flash, and Abdallah mounted
his horse and rode off upon his way. But he had not gone far before
NA
riding along the high-road upon this noble steed, and I myself clad in

NA
NA
NA
out his hand, and in an instant there lay across his arm raiment such
as the eyes of man never saw before--stiff with pearls, and blazing with
diamonds and rubies and emeralds and sapphires. The Genie himself aided
Abdallah to dress, and when he looked down he felt, for the time, quite
satisfied.
He rode a little farther. Then suddenly he bethought himself, â€œWhat a
silly spectacle shall I cut in the town with no money in my purse and
NA
NA
The Genie stretched out his hand, and in it was a casket of
mother-of-pearl inlaid with gold and full of money. â€œHas my lord any

NA
well give me enough at once to last me a long time to come. Let me have
eleven more caskets of money like this one, and eleven more slaves to
NA
NA
youths before Abdallah, as like the first as so many pictures of the
same person, and each youth bore in his hands a box like the one that

 asked the Genie.

to be robbed before he had travelled a hundred paces. Let me have an

gleaming and flashing in the sun, and all seated upon magnificently
NA

to wish for in this world. Thou mayest go, Genie, and it will be long
NA
like a flash.
The captain of Abdallahâ€™s troop--a bearded warrior clad in a superb suit
of armor--rode up to the fagot-maker, and, leaping from his horse and
bowing before him so that his forehead touched the dust, said, â€œWhither
NA
NA
NA

to not wanting thee so soon. I would have thee build me in the city a
magnificent palace, such as man never looked upon before, and let it be
full from top to bottom with rich stuffs and treasures of all sorts. And
let it have gardens and fountains and terraces fitting for such a place,
and let it be meetly served with slaves, both men and women, the most

NA
The fagot-maker meditated a long time. â€œI can bethink myself of nothing
NA
The Genie turned to the captain of the troop and said some words to him
in a strange tongue, and then in a moment was gone. The captain gave the
order to march, and away they all rode with Abdallah in the midst. â€œWho
NA
him swelling with pride as though it would burst--â€œwho would have
thought that only this morning I was a poor fagot-maker, lost in the
woods and half starved to death? Surely there is nothing left for me to
NA
Abdallah was talking of something he knew nothing of.
Never before was such a sight seen in that country, as Abdallah and
his troop rode through the gates and into the streets of the city.
But dazzling and beautiful as were those who rode attendant upon him,
Abdallah the fagot-maker surpassed them all as the moon dims the lustre
of the stars. The people crowded around shouting with wonder, and
Abdallah, in the fulness of his delight, gave orders to the slaves who
bore the caskets of money to open them and to throw the gold to the
people. So, with those in the streets scrambling and fighting for the
money and shouting and cheering, and others gazing down at the spectacle
from the windows and house-tops, the fagot-maker and his troop rode
slowly along through the town.
Now it chanced that their way led along past the royal palace, and the
princess, hearing all the shouting and the hubbub, looked over the edge
of the balcony and down into the street. At the same moment Abdallah
chanced to look up, and their eyes met. Thereupon the fagot-makerâ€™s
heart crumbled away within him, for she was the most beautiful princess
in all the world. Her eyes were as black as night, her hair like threads
of fine silk, her neck like alabaster, and her lips and her cheeks as
soft and as red as rose-leaves. When she saw that Abdallah was looking
at her she dropped the curtain of the balcony and was gone, and the
fagot-maker rode away, sighing like a furnace.
So, by-and-by, he came to his palace, which was built all of marble
as white as snow, and which was surrounded with gardens, shaded by
flowering trees, and cooled by the plashing of fountains. From the
gateway to the door of the palace a carpet of cloth-of-gold had been
spread for him to walk upon, and crowds of slaves stood waiting to
receive him. But for all these glories Abdallah cared nothing; he hardly
looked about him, but, going straight to his room, pressed his ring and
summoned the Genie.
NA
NA
NA
NA
tear down the city to do so. But perhaps this behest is not so hard to
fulfil. First of all, my lord will have to have an ambassador to send to
NA
NA
NA
NA
The king was sitting in council with all of the greatest lords of the
land gathered about him, for the Emperor of India had declared war
against him, and he and they were in debate, discussing how the country
was to be saved. Just then Abdallahâ€™s ambassador arrived, and when he
and his train entered the council-chamber all stood up to receive him,
for the least of those attendant upon him was more magnificently attired
than the king himself, and was bedecked with such jewels as the royal
treasury could not match.
Kneeling before the king, the ambassador touched the ground with his
forehead. Then, still kneeling, he unrolled a scroll, written in letters
of gold, and from it read the message asking for the princess to wife
for the Lord Abdallah.
When he had ended, the king sat for a while stroking his beard and
meditating. But before he spoke the oldest lord of the council arose and
said: â€œO sire! If this Lord Abdallah who asks for the princess for his
wife can send such a magnificent company in the train of his ambassador,
may it not be that he may be able also to help you in your war against
NA
NA
NA
hundred thousand men, to aid me in the war against the Emperor of India,
NA
NA
answer shall be this: That he will help you with an army, not of one
hundred thousand, but of two hundred thousand men. And if to-morrow you
will be pleased to ride forth to the plain that lieth to the south of

once more bowing, he withdrew from the council-chamber, leaving all them
that were there amazed at what had happened.
So the next day the king and all his court rode out to the place
appointed. As they drew near they saw that the whole face of the plain
was covered with a mighty host, drawn up in troops and squadrons. As the
king rode towards this vast army, Abdallah met him, surrounded by his
generals. He dismounted and would have kneeled, but the king would not
permit him, but, raising him, kissed him upon the cheek, calling him
son. Then the king and Abdallah rode down before the ranks and the whole
army waved their swords, and the flashing of the sunlight on the blades
was like lightning, and they shouted, and the noise was like the pealing
of thunder.
Before Abdallah marched off to the wars he and the princess were
married, and for a whole fortnight nothing was heard but the sound of
rejoicing. The city was illuminated from end to end, and all of the
fountains ran with wine instead of water. And of all those who rejoiced,
none was so happy as the princess, for never had she seen one whom
she thought so grand and noble and handsome as her husband. After the
fortnight had passed and gone, the army marched away to the wars with
Abdallah at its head.
Victory after victory followed, for in every engagement the Emperor of
Indiaâ€™s troops were driven from the field. In two monthsâ€™ time the war
was over and Abdallah marched back again--the greatest general in the
world. But it was no longer as Abdallah that he was known, but as the
Emperor of India, for the former emperor had been killed in the war, and
Abdallah had set the crown upon his own head.
The little taste that he had had of conquest had given him an appetite
for more, so that with the armies the Genie provided him he conquered
all the neighboring countries and brought them under his rule. So he
became the greatest emperor in all the world; kings and princes kneeled
before him, and he, Abdallah, the fagot-maker, looking about him, could

Could he desire anything more?
Yes; he did! He desired to be rid of the Genie!
When he thought of how all that he was in power and might--he, the
Emperor of the World--how all his riches and all his glory had come
as gifts from a hideous black monster with only one eye, his heart was

as he has given me all these things, he may take them all away again.

it; who knows but that they might become as great as I, and strip me
of everything, as I have stripped others. Yes; I wish he was out of the

Once, when such thoughts as these were passing through his mind, he was
paying a visit to his father-in-law, the king. He was walking up and
down the terrace of the garden meditating on these matters, when,
leaning over a wall and looking down into the street, he saw a
fagot-maker--just such a fagot-maker as he himself had one time
been--driving an ass--just such an ass as he had one time driven. The
fagot-maker carried something under his arm, and what should it be but
the very casket in which the Genie had once been imprisoned, and
which he--the one-time fagot-maker--had seen the Genie kick over the
tree-tops.
The sight of the casket put a sudden thought into his mind. He shouted
to his attendants, and bade them haste and bring the fagot-maker to
him. Off they ran, and in a little while came dragging the poor wretch,
trembling and as white as death; for he thought nothing less than that
his end had certainly come. As soon as those who had seized him had
loosened their hold, he flung himself prostrate at the feet of the
Emperor Abdallah, and there lay like one dead.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
So soon as he had the casket safe in his hands he hurried away to his
privy chamber, and there pressed the red stone in his ring. â€œIn the
NA
moment the Genie stood before him.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
It was in vain that the Genie begged and implored for mercy, it was in
vain that he reminded Abdallah of all that he had done to benefit him;
the great emperor stood as hard as a rock--into the casket the Genie
must and should go. So at last into the casket the monster went,
bellowing most lamentably.
The Emperor Abdallah shut the lid of the casket, and locked it and
sealed it with his seal. Then, hiding it under his cloak, he bore it out
into the garden and to a deep well, and, first making sure that nobody
was by to see, dropped casket and Genie and all into the water.
Now had that wise man been by--the wise man who had laughed so when
the poor young fagot-maker wept and wailed at the ingratitude of
his friend--the wise man who had laughed still louder when the young
fagot-maker vowed that in another case he would not have been so
ungrateful to one who had benefited him--how that wise man would have
roared when he heard the casket plump into the waters of the well! For,
upon my word of honor, betwixt Ali the fagot-maker and Abdallah the
Emperor of the World there was not a pin to choose, except in degree.
Old Ali Babaâ€™s pipe had nearly gone out, and he fell a puffing at it
until the spark grew to life again, and until great clouds of smoke
rolled out around his head and up through the rafters above.

I liked more especially the way in which thy emperor got rid of his

Much shall have more and little shall have less.
Once upon a time there was a king who did the best he could to rule
wisely and well, and to deal justly by those under him whom he had to
take care of; and as he could not trust hearsay, he used every now and
then to slip away out of his palace and go among his people to hear what
they had to say for themselves about him and the way he ruled the land.
Well, one such day as this, when he was taking a walk, he strolled out
past the walls of the town and into the green fields until he came at
last to a fine big house that stood by the banks of a river, wherein
lived a man and his wife who were very well to do in the world. There
the king stopped for a bite of bread and a drink of fresh milk.

Now in the town there lived two beggars who were as poor as poverty
itself, and the poorer of the twain was one who used to sit in rags and
tatters on the church step to beg charity of the good folk who came and
went. To him went the rich man, and, without so much as a good-morning,
NA
of gold into the beggarâ€™s hat. Then away he went without waiting for a
word of thanks.
As for the beggar, he just sat there for a while goggling and staring
like one moon-struck. But at last his wits came back to him, and then
away he scampered home as fast as his legs could carry him. Then he
spread his money out on the table and counted it--three hundred pieces
of gold money! He had never seen such great riches in his life before.
There he sat feasting his eyes upon the treasure as though they would
never get their fill. And now what was he to do with all of it? Should
he share his fortune with his brother? Not a bit of it. To be sure,
until now they had always shared and shared alike, but here was the
first great lump of good-luck that had ever fallen in his way, and he
was not for spoiling it by cutting it in two to give half to a poor
beggar-man such as his brother. Not he; he would hide it and keep it all
for his very own.
Now, not far from where he lived, and beside the river, stood a
willow-tree, and thither the lucky beggar took his purse of money and
stuffed it into a knot-hole of a withered branch, then went his
way, certain that nobody would think of looking for money in such a
hiding-place. Then all the rest of the day he sat thinking and thinking
of the ways he would spend what had been given him, and what he would do
to get the most good out of it. At last came evening, and his brother,
who had been begging in another part of the town, came home again.
NA
come into the house.
NA
NA
NA
â€œI just broke a dead branch off of the willow-tree and drew my hat

NA
NA
NA
NA
The first beggar could hardly breathe.
NA
NA
The beggar to whom the money had been given ran out of the house
howling, and down to the river-side, thumping his head with his knuckles
like one possessed. For he knew that the branch his brother had broken
off of the tree and had thrown into the water, was the very one in which
he had hidden the bag of money.
Yes; and so it was.
The next morning, as the rich man took a walk down by the river, he saw
NA
NA
So he brought it to the house, and, taking down his axe, began to split
it up for kindling. The very first blow he gave, out tumbled the bag of
money.
But the beggar--well, by-and-by his grieving got better of its first
smart, and then he started off down the river to see if he could not
find his money again. He hunted up and he hunted down, but never a whit
of it did he see, and at last he stopped at the rich manâ€™s house and
begged for a bite to eat and lodgings for the night. There he told all
his story--how he had hidden the money that had been given him from his
brother, how his brother had broken off the branch and had thrown it
away, and how he had spent the whole live-long day searching for it. And
to all the rich man listened and said never a word. But though he said
nothing, he thought to himself, â€œMaybe, after all, it is not the will of
Heaven that this man shall have the money. Nevertheless, I will give him

So he told the poor beggar to come in and stay for the night; and,
whilst the beggar was snoring away in his bed in the garret, the rich
man had his wife make two great pies, each with a fine brown crust. In
the first pie he put the little bag of money; the second he filled full
of rusty nails and scraps of iron.
NA
grieve sadly for the story you told me last night. But maybe, after all,
your luck is not all gone. And now, if you will choose as you should
choose, you shall not go away from here comfortless. In the pantry
yonder are two great pies--one is for you and one for me. Go in and take

NA
NA
 Nevertheless, as it was the best thing to be had, into the pantry the
beggar went and there began to feel and weigh the pies, and the one
filled with the rusty nails and scraps of iron was ever so much the
fatter and the heavier.
NA
NA
Well, before he got back to the town he grew hungry, and sat down by the
roadside to eat his pie; and if there was ever an angry man in the world
before, he was one that day--for there was his pie full of nothing but
rusty nails and bits of iron. â€œThis is the way the rich always treat the

So back he went in a fume. â€œWhat did you give me a pie full of old nails

So that night the rich man had his wife bake two loaves of bread, in one
of which she hid the bag with the three hundred pieces of gold money.
NA
there you will find two loaves of bread--one is for you and one for me;

So in went the beggar, and the first loaf of bread he laid his hand upon
was the one in which the money was hidden, and off he marched with it
under his arm, without so much as saying thank you.

That was cheap enough, so the woman paid him his price and off she went

Now it happened that the day before this very woman had borrowed just
such a loaf of bread from the rich manâ€™s wife; and so, as there was
plenty in the house without it, she wrapped this loaf up in a napkin,
and sent her husband back with it to where it had started from first of
all.

Wisdomâ€™s Wages and Follyâ€™s Pay
Once upon a time there was a wise man of wise men, and a great magician
to boot, and his name was Doctor Simon Agricola.
Once upon a time there was a simpleton of simpletons, and a great booby
to boot, and his name was Babo.
Simon Agricola had read all the books written by man, and could do more
magic than any conjurer that ever lived. But, nevertheless, he was
none too well off in the world; his clothes were patched, and his shoes
gaped, and that is the way with many another wise man of whom I have
heard tell.
Babo gathered rushes for a chair-maker, and he also had too few of the
good things to make life easy. But it is nothing out of the way for a
simpleton to be in that case.
The two of them lived neighbor to neighbor, the one in the next house
to the other, and so far as the world could see there was not a pin to
choose between them--only that one was called a wise man and the other a
simpleton.
One day the weather was cold, and when Babo came home from gathering
rushes he found no fire in the house. So off he went to his neighbor the
NA

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
he, â€œI have lived more than seventy years, and have read all the books
in the world; I have practised magic and necromancy, and know all about
algebra and geometry, and yet, wise as I am, I never thought of this
NA
That is the way with your wise man.
NA
NA
NA
into the world to make my fortune, for little or nothing is to be had in
NA
NA
bright and early off they started upon their journey, cheek by jowl, the
wise man and the simpleton, to make their fortunes in the wide world,
and the two of them made a pair. On they jogged and on they jogged,
and the way was none too smooth. By-and-by they came to a great field
covered all over with round stones.
NA
NA
his two fists, and dropped it into the pouch that dangled at his side.
NA
two legs can do to carry my body, let along lugging a great stone into
NA
NA
on he tramped, with Babo at his heels.
At last they came to a great wide plain, where, far or near, nothing was
to be seen but bare sand, without so much as a pebble or a single blade
of grass, and there night caught up with them.
NA
NA
So down they sat, and Simon Agricola opened his pouch and drew forth the
stone.
The stone? It was a stone no longer, but a fine loaf of white bread as
big as your two fists. You should have seen Babo goggle and stare! â€œGive
NA
NA
had you chosen to do as I bade you and to fetch them along with you.
NA
Babo got for his supper. As for the wise man, he finished his loaf of
bread to the last crumb, and then went to sleep with a full stomach and
a contented mind.
The next morning off they started again bright and early, and before
long they came to just such another field of stones as they left behind
them the day before.
NA
NA
NA
But Babo had no notion to go hungry the second time, so he hunted around
till he found a stone as big as his head. All day he carried it, first
under one arm, and then under the other. The wise man stepped along
briskly enough, but the sweat ran down Baboâ€™s face like drops on the
window in an April shower. At last they came to a great wide plain,
where neither stock nor stone was to be seen, but only a gallows-tree,
upon which one poor wight hung dancing upon nothing at all, and there
night caught them again.
NA
NA
But listen to what happened. Up stepped the wise man to the gallows, and
gave it a sharp rap with his staff. Then, lo and behold! The gallows was
gone, and in its place stood a fine inn, with lights in the windows, and
a landlord bowing and smiling in the doorway, and a fire roaring in
the kitchen, and the smell of good things cooking filling the air all
around, so that only to sniff did oneâ€™s heart good.
Poor Babo let fall the stone he had carried all day. A stone it was, and
a stone he let fall.
NA
NA
good supper and a sound sleep, and that is a cure for most of a bodyâ€™s
troubles in this world.
The third day of their travelling they came to farms and villages, and
there Simon Agricola began to think of showing some of those tricks of
magic that were to make his fortune and Baboâ€™s into the bargain.
At last they came to a blacksmithâ€™s shop, and there was the smith hard
at work, dinging and donging, and making sweet music with hammer and
anvil. In walked Simon Agricola and gave him good-day. He put his
fingers into his purse, and brought out all the money he had in
NA
blacksmith; â€œif you will let me have your forge for one hour, I will
NA
NA
 said he; and he took off his leathern apron without another word, and
Simon Agricola put it on in his stead.
Presently, who should come riding up to the blacksmithâ€™s shop but a rich
old nobleman and three servants. The servants were hale, stout fellows,
but the nobleman was as withered as a winter leaf. â€œCan you shoe my
NA
because of his leathern apron.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
So Simon Agricola gave the word, and Babo blew the bellows until the
fire blazed and roared. Then the doctor caught the old nobleman, and
laid him upon the forge. He heaped the coals over him, and turned him
this way and that, until he grew red-hot, like a piece of iron. Then he
drew him forth from the fire and dipped him in the water-tank. Phizz!
The water hissed, and the steam rose up in a cloud; and when Simon
Agricola took the old nobleman out, lo and behold! He was as fresh and
blooming and lusty as a lad of twenty.
But you should have seen how all the people stared and goggled!--Babo
and the blacksmith and the noblemanâ€™s servants. The nobleman strutted up
and down for a while, admiring himself, and then he got upon his
NA
NA
NA
his heels; and that was all the good that Simon Agricola had of this
trick. But ill-luck was not done with him yet, for when the smith saw
how matters had turned out, he laid hold of the doctor and would not let
him go until he had paid him the golden angel he had promised for the
use of the forge. The doctor pulled a sour face, but all the same he
had to pay the angel. Then the smith let him go, and off he marched in a
huff.
Outside of the forge was the smithâ€™s mother--a poor old creature,
withered and twisted and bent as a winter twig. Babo had kept his eyes
open, and had not travelled with Simon Agricola for nothing. He plucked
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Well, the smith paid the money, and Babo bade him blow the bellows. When
the fire roared up good and hot, he caught up the old mother, and, in
spite of her scratching and squalling, he laid her upon the embers.
By-and-by, when he thought the right time had come, he took her out and
dipped her in the tank of water; but instead of turning young, there she
lay, as dumb as a fish and as black as coal.
When the blacksmith saw what Babo had done to his mother, he caught him
by the collar, and fell to giving him such a dressing down as never man
had before.
NA
Such a hubbub had not been heard in that town for many a day. Back came
Simon Agricola running, and there he saw, and took it all in in one
look.
NA
NA
NA
and you must cure my mother, or else Iâ€™ll have you both up before the
NA
NA
and the doctor dipped the woman in the water. When he brought her out
she was as well and strong as ever--but just as old as she had been
before.
NA
â€œand if you ever come this way again, Iâ€™ll set all the dogs in the town
NA
Simon Agricola said nothing until they had come out upon the highway
again, and left the town well behind them; then--â€œBorn a fool, live a
NA
Babo said nothing, but he rubbed the places where the smith had dusted
his coat.
The fourth day of their journey they came to a town, and here Simon
Agricola was for trying his tricks of magic again. He and Babo took
up their stand in the corner of the market-place, and began bawling,
â€œDoctor Knowall! Doctor Knowall! Who has come from the other end of
Nowhere! He can cure any sickness or pain! He can bring you back from
NA
Now there was a very, very rich man in that town, whose daughter lay
sick to death; and when the news of this great doctor was brought to his
ears, he was for having him try his hand at curing the girl.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Simon Agricola drew a little vial from his bosom. From it he poured
just six drops of yellow liquor upon the girlâ€™s tongue. Then--lo and
behold!--up she sat in bed as well and strong as ever, and asked for a
boiled chicken and a dumpling, by way of something to eat.
NA
â€œYes, yes; blessings are very good, but I would like to have my two
NA
â€œTwo thousand golden angels! I said nothing about two thousand golden
NA
Pooh! You must have been dreaming! See, here are two hundred silver
pennies, and that is enough and more than enough for six drops of
NA
NA
NA
NA
a huff.
But Babo had kept his eyes open. Simon Agricola had laid down the vial
upon the table, and while they were saying this and that back and forth,
thinking of nothing else, Babo quietly slipped it into his own pocket,
without any one but himself being the wiser.
Down the stairs stumped the doctor with Babo at his heels. There stood
the cook waiting for them.
NA
NA

NA
medicine. Give me the two hundred pennies that the master would not
NA
NA
and Babo slipped them into his pocket. He bade the woman open her mouth,
and when she had done so he poured all the stuff down her throat at
once.
NA
dumb as a herring in a box.
When the cook saw what Babo had done, he snatched up the rolling-pin and
made at him to pound his head to a jelly. But Babo did not wait for his
coming; he jumped out of the window, and away he scampered with the cook
at his heels.
Well, the upshot of the business was that Simon Agricola had to go back
and bring life to the woman again, or the cook would thump him and Babo
both with the rolling-pin. And, what was more, Babo had to pay back the
two hundred pennies that the cook had given him for curing his wife.
The wise man made a cross upon the womanâ€™s forehead, and up she sat, as
well--but no better--as before.
NA
NA
Simon Agricola said never a word until they had gotten out of the town.
NA
to Babo: â€œBorn a fool, live a fool, die a fool.â€™ I want no more of you.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
other.
(You may go with the wise man if you choose, but I shall jog along with
the simpleton.)
After Babo had travelled for a while, he knew not whither, night caught
him, and he lay down under a hedge to sleep. There he lay, and snored
away like a saw-mill, for he was wearied with his long journeying.
Now it chanced that that same night two thieves had broken into a
miserâ€™s house, and had stolen an iron pot full of gold money. Day broke
before they reached home, so down they sat to consider the matter; and
the place where they seated themselves was on the other side of the
hedge where Babo lay. The older thief was for carrying the money home
under his coat; the younger was for burying it until night had come
again. They squabbled and bickered and argued till the noise they made
wakened Babo, and he sat up. The first thing he thought of was the
advice that the doctor had given him the evening before.
NA
NA
When the two thieves heard Baboâ€™s piece of advice, they thought that the
judgeâ€™s officers were after them for sure and certain. Down they dropped
the pot of money, and away they scampered as fast as their legs could
carry them.
Babo heard them running, and poked his head through the hedge, and there
NA
that was given me; no one ever gave me advice that was worth so much
NA
He had not gone far before he met two of the kingâ€™s officers, and you
may guess how they opened their eyes when they saw him travelling along
the highway with a pot full of gold money.
NA
NA
NA
NA
For a piece of advice! No, no--the kingâ€™s officers knew butter from
lard, and truth from tâ€™other thing. It was just the same in that country
as it is in our town--there was nothing in the world so cheap as advice.
Whoever heard of anybody giving a pot of gold and silver money for it?
Without another word they marched Babo and his pot of money off to the
king.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
piece of advice for one day on trial.
Now the chief councillor and some others had laid a plot against the
kingâ€™s life, and that morning it had been settled that when the barber
shaved him he was to cut his throat with a razor. So after the barber
had lathered his face he began to whet the razor, and to whet the razor.
Just at that moment the king remembered Baboâ€™s piece of advice. â€œThink
NA
NA
When the barber heard the words that the king said, he thought that
all had been discovered. Down he fell upon his knees, and confessed
everything.
That is how Baboâ€™s advice saved the kingâ€™s life--you can guess whether
the king thought it was worth much or little. When Babo came the next
morning the king gave him ten chests full of money, and that made the
simpleton richer than anybody in all that land.
He built himself a fine house, and by-and-by married the daughter of the
new councillor that came after the other oneâ€™s head had been chopped off
for conspiring against the kingâ€™s life. Besides that, he came and went
about the kingâ€™s castle as he pleased, and the king made much of him.
Everybody bowed to him, and all were glad to stop and chat awhile with
him when they met him in the street.
One morning Babo looked out of the window, and who should he see come
travelling along the road but Simon Agricola himself, and he was just as
poor and dusty and travel-stained as ever.
NA
when he saw the simpleton living in such a fine way. But he opened his
eyes wider than ever when he heard that all these good things came from
the piece of advice he had given Babo that day they had parted at the
cross roads.
NA
if you will pay me a thousand golden angels, I will give you something
better than a piece of advice. I will teach you all the magic that is to
NA
NA
NA
NA
That is all of this tale except the tip end of it, and that I will give
you now.
I have heard tell that one day the king dropped in the street the piece
of advice that he had bought from Babo, and that before he found it
again it had been trampled into the mud and dirt. I cannot say for
certain that this is the truth, but it must have been spoiled in some
way or other, for I have never heard of anybody in these days who would
give even so much as a bad penny for it; and yet it is worth just as
much now as it was when Babo sold it to the king.
I had sat listening to these jolly folk for all this time, and I had not
heard old Sindbad say a word, and yet I knew very well he was full of
a story, for every now and then I could see his lips move, and he would
smile, and anon he would stroke his long white beard and smile again.
Everybody clapped their hands and rattled their canicans after the
Blacksmith had ended his story, and methought they liked it better
than almost anything that had been told. Then there was a pause, and
everybody was still, and as nobody else spoke I myself ventured to break
NA
ears, as oneâ€™s voice always does sound in Twilight Land), â€œI would like
to hear our friend Sindbad the Sailor tell a story. Methinks one is

Old Sindbad smiled until his cheeks crinkled into wrinkles.

The Enchanted Island.
But it is not always the lucky one that carries away the plums;
sometimes he only shakes the tree, and the wise man pockets the fruit.
Once upon a long, long time ago, and in a country far, far away, there
lived two men in the same town and both were named Selim; one was Selim
the Baker and one was Selim the Fisherman.
Selim the Baker was well off in the world, but Selim the Fisherman was
only so-so. Selim the Baker always had plenty to eat and a warm corner
in cold weather, but many and many a time Selim the Fishermanâ€™s stomach
went empty and his teeth went chattering.
Once it happened that for time after time Selim the Fisherman caught
nothing but bad luck in his nets, and not so much as a single sprat,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
bargains sometimes; and therewith he got his loaf of bread.
So the next day Selim the Fisherman fished and fished and fished and
fished, and still he caught no more than the day before; until just
at sunset he cast his net for the last time for the day, and, lo and
behold! There was something heavy in it. So he dragged it ashore, and
what should it be but a leaden box, sealed as tight as wax, and covered
NA
NA
an honest man, off he marched with it to Selim the Baker.
They opened the box in the bakerâ€™s shop, and within they found two rolls
of yellow linen. In each of the rolls of linen was another little leaden
box: in one was a finger-ring of gold set with a red stone, in the other
was a finger-ring of iron set with nothing at all.
That was all the box held; nevertheless, that was the greatest catch
that ever any fisherman made in the world; for, though Selim the one or
Selim the other knew no more of the matter than the cat under the stove,
the gold ring was the Ring of Luck and the iron ring was the Ring of
Wisdom.
Inside of the gold ring were carved these letters: â€œWhosoever wears me,
shall have that which all men seek--for so it is with good-luck in this
NA
Inside of the iron ring were written these words: â€œWhosoever wears me,
shall have that which few men care for--and that is the way it is with
NA
NA
on his finger, â€œI have driven a good bargain, and you have paid for your
NA
NA
NA
Well, that evening, as Selim the Baker sat in front of his shop in the
twilight smoking a pipe of tobacco, the ring he wore began to work. Up
came a little old man with a white beard, and he was dressed all in gray
from top to toe, and he wore a black velvet cap, and he carried a long
staff in his hand. He stopped in front of Selim the Baker, and stood
NA
he.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
followed the way the old man led.
Up one street they went, and down another, and here and there through
alleys and byways where Selim had never been before. At last they came
to where a high wall ran along the narrow street, with a garden behind
it, and by-and-by to an iron gate. The old man rapped upon the gate
three times with his knuckles, and cried in a loud voice, â€œOpen to
NA
Then instantly the gate swung open, and Selim the Baker followed the old
man into the garden.
Bang! shut the gate behind him, and there he was.
There he was! And such a place he had never seen before. Such fruit!
Such flowers! Such fountains! Such summer-houses!
NA
NA
He led the way down a long pathway between the trees, and Selim
followed. By-and-by, far away, they saw the light of torches; and when
they came to what they saw, lo and behold! there was the sea-shore, and
a boat with four-and-twenty oarsmen, each dressed in cloth of gold and
silver more splendidly than a prince. And there were four-and-twenty
black slaves, carrying each a torch of spice-wood, so that all the
air was filled with sweet smells. The old man led the way, and Selim,
following, entered the boat; and there was a seat for him made soft with
satin cushions embroidered with gold and precious stones and stuffed
with down, and Selim wondered whether he was not dreaming.
The oarsmen pushed off from the shore and away they rowed.
On they rowed and on they rowed for all that livelong night.
At last morning broke, and then as the sun rose Selim saw such a sight
as never mortal eyes beheld before or since. It was the wonder of
wonders--a great city built on an island. The island was all one
mountain; and on it, one above another and another above that again,
stood palaces that glistened like snow, and orchards of fruit, and
gardens of flowers and green trees.
And as the boat came nearer and nearer to the city, Selim could see that
all around on the house-tops and down to the waterâ€™s edge were crowds
and crowds of people. All were looking out towards the sea, and when
they saw the boat and Selim in it, a great shout went up like the
roaring of rushing waters.
NA
Then the boat landed, and there stood dozens of scores of great princes
and nobles to welcome Selim when he came ashore. And there was a white
horse waiting for him to ride, and its saddle and bridle were studded
with diamonds and rubies and emeralds that sparkled and glistened like
the stars in heaven, and Selim thought for sure he must be dreaming with
his eyes open.
But he was not dreaming, for it was all as true as that eggs are eggs.
So up the hill he rode, and to the grandest and the most splendid of all
the splendid palaces, the princes and noblemen riding with him, and the
crowd shouting as though to split their throats.
And what a palace it was!--as white as snow and painted all inside
with gold and blue. All around it were gardens blooming with fruit and
flowers, and the like of it mortal man never saw in the world before.
There they made a king of Selim, and put a golden crown on his head; and
that is what the Ring of Good Luck can do for a baker.
But wait a bit! There was something queer about it all, and that is now
to be told.
All that day was feasting and drinking and merry-making, and the
twinging and twanging of music, and dancing of beautiful dancing-girls,
and such things as Selim had never heard tell of in all his life before.
And when night came they lit thousands and thousands of candles of
perfumed wax; so that it was a hard matter to say when night began and
day ended, only that the one smelled sweeter than the other.
But at last it came midnight, and then suddenly, in an instant, all the
lights went out and everything was as dark as pitch--not a spark, not
a glimmer anywhere. And, just as suddenly, all the sound of music and
dancing and merrymaking ceased, and everybody began to wail and cry
until it was enough to wring oneâ€™s heart to hear. Then, in the midst of
all the wailing and crying, a door was flung open, and in came six tall
and terrible black men, dressed all in black from top to toe, carrying
each a flaming torch; and by the light of the torches King Selim saw
that all--the princes, the noblemen, the dancing-girls--all lay on their
faces on the floor.
The six men took King Selim--who shuddered and shook with fear--by the
arms, and marched him through dark, gloomy entries and passage-ways,
until they came at last to the very heart of the palace.
There was a great high-vaulted room all of black marble, and in the
middle of it was a pedestal with seven steps, all of black marble; and
on the pedestal stood a stone statue of a woman looking as natural as
life, only that her eyes were shut. The statue was dressed like a queen:
she wore a golden crown on her head, and upon her body hung golden
robes, set with diamonds and emeralds and rubies and sapphires and
pearls and all sorts of precious stones.
As for the face of the statue, white paper and black ink could not tell
you how beautiful it was. When Selim looked at it, it made his heart
stand still in his breast, it was so beautiful.
The six men brought Selim up in front of the statue, and then a voice
NA
â€œwhat are thou doing? To-day is feasting and drinking and merry-making,
NA
As soon as these words were ended the six black men marched King Selim
back whence they had brought him; there they left him and passed out one
by one as they had first come in, and the door shut to behind them.
Then in an instant the lights flashed out again, the music began to
play and the people began to talk and laugh, and King Selim thought that
maybe all that had just passed was only a bit of an ugly dream after
all.
So that is the way King Selim the Baker began to reign, and that is the
way he continued to reign. All day was feasting and drinking and making
merry and music and laughing and talking. But every night at midnight
the same thing happened: the lights went out, all the people began
wailing and crying, and the six tall, terrible black men came with
flashing torches and marched King Selim away to the beautiful statue.
And every night the same voice said--â€œSelim! Selim! Selim! What art thou
doing! To-day is feasting and drinking and merry-making; but beware of
NA
So things went on for a twelvemonth, and at last came the end of the
year. That day and night the merry-making was merrier and wilder and
madder than it had ever been before, but the great clock in the tower
went on--tick, tock! tick, tock!--and by and by it came midnight. Then,
as it always happened before, the lights went out, and all was as
black as ink. But this time there was no wailing and crying out, but
everything was silent as death; the door opened slowly, and in came, not
six black men as before, but nine men as silent as death, dressed all in
flaming red, and the torches they carried burned as red as blood. They
took King Selim by the arms, just as the six men had done, and marched
him through the same entries and passageways, and so came at last to
the same vaulted room. There stood the statue, but now it was turned to
flesh and blood, and the eyes were open and looking straight at Selim
the Baker.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The words had hardly left his lips when the statue gave a great cry and
clapped her hands together. In an instant an echoing cry sounded all
over the town--a shriek fit to split the ears.
The next moment there came another sound--a sound like thunder--above
and below and everywhere. The earth began to shake and to rock, and the
houses began to topple and fall, and the people began to scream and to
yell and to shout, and the waters of the sea began to lash and to roar,
and the wind began to bellow and howl. Then it was a good thing for King
Selim that he wore Luckâ€™s Ring; for, though all the beautiful snow-white
palace about him and above him began to crumble to pieces like slaked
lime, the sticks and the stones and the beams to fall this side of him
and that, he crawled out from under it without a scratch or a bruise,
like a rat out of a cellar.
That is what Luckâ€™s Ring did for him.
But his troubles were not over yet; for, just as he came out from under
all the ruin, the island began to sink down into the water, carrying
everything along with it--that is, everything but him and one thing
else. That one other thing was an empty boat, and King Selim climbed
into it, and nothing else saved him from drowning. It was Luckâ€™s Ring
that did that for him also.
The boat floated on and on until it came to another island that was just
like the island he had left, only that there was neither tree nor blade
of grass nor hide nor hair nor living thing of any kind. Nevertheless,
it was an island just like the other: a high mountain and nothing else.
There Selim the Baker went ashore, and there he would have starved to
death only for Luckâ€™s Ring; for one day a boat came sailing by, and when
poor Selim shouted, those aboard heard him and came and took him off.
How they all stared to see his golden crown--for he still wore it--and
his robes of silk and satin and the gold and jewels!
Before they would consent to carry him away, they made him give up all
the fine things he had. Then they took him home again to the town whence
he had first come, just as poor as when he had started. Back he went to
his bake-shop and his ovens, and the first thing he did was to take off
his gold ring and put it on the shelf.
NA
NA
That is the way with mortal man: for one has to have the Ring of Wisdom
as well, to turn the Ring of Luck to good account.
And now for Selim the Fisherman.
Well, thus it happened to him. For a while he carried the iron ring
around in his pocket--just as so many of us do--without thinking to put
it on. But one day he slipped it on his finger--and that is what we do
not all of us do. After that he never took it off again, and the world
went smoothly with him. He was not rich, but then he was not poor; he
was not merry, neither was he sad. He always had enough and was thankful
for it, for I never yet knew wisdom to go begging or crying.
So he went his way and he fished his fish, and twelve months and a week
or more passed by. Then one day he went past the baker shop and there
sat Selim the Baker smoking his pipe of tobacco.

Thereupon he told Selim the Fisherman the story of what had happened to
him with all its ins and outs, just as I have told it to you.

island myself. If you want the ring no longer, just let me have it; for

NA
NA
So Selim the Fisherman put on the ring, and then went his way about his
own business.
That night, as he came home carrying his nets over his shoulder, whom
should he meet but the little old man in gray, with the white beard and
the black cap on his head and the long staff in his hand.
NA
the Baker.
NA
NA
just as he had said before.
NA
NA
NA
Selim the Fisherman remembered all that Selim the Baker had told him,
and he took no two thoughts as to what to do. Down he tumbled his nets,
and away he went after the other as fast as his legs could carry him.
Here they went and there they went, up crooked streets and lanes and
down by-ways and alley-ways, until at last they came to the same garden
to which Selim the Baker had been brought. Then the old man knocked at
the gate three times and cried out in a loud voice, â€œOpen! Open! Open to
NA
Then the gate opened, and in they went. Fine as it all was, Selim
the Fisherman cared to look neither to the right nor to the left, but
straight after the old man he went, until at last they came to the
seaside and the boat and the four-and-twenty oarsmen dressed like
princes and the black slaves with the perfumed torches.
Here the old man entered the boat and Selim after him, and away they
sailed.
To make a long story short, everything happened to Selim the Fisherman
just as it had happened to Selim the Baker. At dawn of day they came to
the island and the city built on the mountain. And the palaces were just
as white and beautiful, and the gardens and orchards just as fresh and
blooming as though they had not all tumbled down and sunk under the
water a week before, almost carrying poor Selim the Baker with them.
There were the people dressed in silks and satins and jewels, just as
Selim the Baker had found them, and they shouted and hurrahed for Selim
the Fisherman just as they had shouted and hurrahed for the other.
There were the princes and the nobles and the white horse, and Selim the
Fisherman got on his back and rode up to a dazzling snow-white palace,
and they put a crown on his head and made a king of him, just as they
had made a king of Selim the Baker.
That night, at midnight, it happened just as it had happened before.
Suddenly, as the hour struck, the lights all went out, and there was a
moaning and a crying enough to make the heart curdle. Then the door
flew open, and in came the six terrible black men with torches. They
led Selim the Fisherman through damp and dismal entries and passage-ways
until they came to the vaulted room of black marble, and there stood
the beautiful statue on its black pedestal. Then came the voice from
NA
NA
But Selim the Fisherman did not stand still and listen, as Selim the
Baker had done. He called out, â€œI hear the words! I am listening! I will
NA
I do not know what I should have done had I been king of that island and
had I known that in a twelve-month it would all come tumbling down about
my ears and sink into the sea, maybe carry me along with it. This is
what Selim the Fisherman did [but then he wore the iron Ring of Wisdom
on his finger, and I never had that upon mine]:
First of all, he called the wisest men of the island to him, and found
from them just where the other desert island lay upon which the boat
with Selim the Baker in it had drifted.
Then, when he had learned where it was to be found, he sent armies and
armies of men and built on that island palaces and houses, and planted
there orchards and gardens, just like the palaces and the orchards and
the gardens about him--only a great deal finer. Then he sent fleets and
fleets of ships, and carried everything away from the island where he
lived to that other island--all the men and the women and the children;
all the flocks and herds and every living thing; all the fowls and the
birds and everything that wore feathers; all the gold and the silver and
the jewels and the silks and the satins, and whatever was of any good
or of any use; and when all these things were done, there were still two
days left till the end of the year.
Upon the first of these two days he sent over the beautiful statue and
had it set up in the very midst of the splendid new palace he had built.
Upon the second day he went over himself, leaving behind him nothing but
the dead mountain and the rocks and the empty houses.
So came the end of the twelve months.
So came midnight.
Out went all the lights in the new palace, and everything was as silent
as death and as black as ink. The door opened, and in came the nine
men in red, with torches burning as red as blood. They took Selim the
Fisherman by the arms and led him to the beautiful statue, and there she
was with her eyes open.
NA
NA
NA
NA
There was no roaring and thundering, there was no shaking and quaking,
there was no toppling and tumbling, there was no splashing and dashing:
for this island was solid rock, and was not all enchantment and hollow
inside and underneath like the other which he had left behind.
The beautiful statue smiled until the place lit up as though the sun
shone. Down she came from the pedestal where she stood and kissed Selim
the Fisherman on the lips.
Then instantly the lights blazed everywhere, and the people shouted and
cheered, and the music played. But neither Selim the Fisherman nor the
beautiful statue saw or heard anything.

NA
statue--only she was not a statue any longer.
After that they were married, and Selim the Fisherman and the enchanted
statue became king and queen in real earnest.
I think Selim the Fisherman sent for Selim the Baker and made him rich
and happy--I hope he did--I am sure he did.
So, after all, it is not always the lucky one who gathers the plums when
wisdom is by to pick up what the other shakes down.
I could say more; for, O little children! little children! there is
more than meat in many an egg-shell; and many a fool tells a story that
joggles a wise manâ€™s wits, and many a man dances and junkets in his
foolâ€™s paradise till it comes tumbling down about his ears some day; and
there are few men who are like Selim the Fisherman, who wear the Ring of
Wisdom on their finger, and, alack-a-day! I am not one of them, and that
is the end of this story.

NA
All Things are as Fate wills.
Once upon a time, in the old, old days, there lived a king who had a
head upon his shoulders wiser than other folk, and this was why: though
he was richer and wiser and greater than most kings, and had all that he
wanted and more into the bargain, he was so afraid of becoming proud of
his own prosperity that he had these words written in letters of gold
upon the walls of each and every room in his palace:
All Things are as Fate wills.
Now, by-and-by and after a while the king died; for when his time comes,
even the rich and the wise man must die, as well as the poor and the
simple man. So the kingâ€™s son came, in turn, to be king of that land;
and, though he was not so bad as the world of men goes, he was not the
man that his father was, as this story will show you.
One day, as he sat with his chief councillor, his eyes fell upon the
words written in letters of gold upon the wall--the words that his
father had written there in time gone by:
All Things are as Fate wills; and the young king did not like the taste
NA
 said he, pointing to the words on the wall. â€œLet them be painted out,
and these words written in their place:

Now, the chief councillor was a grave old man, and had been councillor

NA
NA
my words. Bring me hither some beggar from the town whom Fate has made
poor, and I will make him rich. So I will show you that his life shall

Now, in that town there was a poor beggar-man who used to sit every
day beside the town gate, begging for something for charityâ€™s sake.
Sometimes people gave him a penny or two, but it was little or nothing
that he got, for Fate was against him.
The same day that the king and the chief councillor had had their
talk together, as the beggar sat holding up his wooden bowl and asking
charity of those who passed by, there suddenly came three men who,
without saying a word, clapped hold of him and marched him off.
It was in vain that the beggar talked and questioned--in vain that he
begged and besought them to let him go. Not a word did they say to him,
either of good or bad. At last they came to a gate that led through a
high wall and into a garden, and there the three stopped, and one of
them knocked upon the gate. In answer to his knocking it flew open. He
thrust the beggar into the garden neck and crop, and then the gate was
banged to again.
But what a sight it was the beggar saw before his eyes!--flowers, and
fruit-trees, and marble walks, and a great fountain that shot up a
jet of water as white as snow. But he had not long to stand gaping and
staring around him, for in the garden were a great number of people,
who came hurrying to him, and who, without speaking a word to him or
answering a single question, or as much as giving him time to think,
led him to a marble bath of tepid water. There he was stripped of his
tattered clothes and washed as clean as snow. Then, as some of the
attendants dried him with fine linen towels, others came carrying
clothes fit for a prince to wear, and clad the beggar in them from head
to foot. After that, still without saying a word, they let him out from
the bath again, and there he found still other attendants waiting for
him--two of them holding a milk-white horse, saddled and bridled, and
fit for an emperor to ride. These helped him to mount, and then, leaping
into their own saddles, rode away with the beggar in their midst.
They rode of the garden and into the streets, and on and on they went
until they came to the kingâ€™s palace, and there they stopped. Courtiers
and noblemen and great lords were waiting for their coming, some of whom
helped him to dismount from the horse, for by this time the beggar was
so overcome with wonder that he stared like one moon-struck, and as
though his wits were addled. Then, leading the way up the palace steps,
they conducted him from room to room, until at last they came to one
more grand and splendid than all the rest, and there sat the king
himself waiting for the beggarâ€™s coming.
The beggar would have flung himself at the kingâ€™s feet, but the king
would not let him; for he came down from the throne where he sat, and,
taking the beggar by the hand, led him up and sat him alongside of him.
Then the king gave orders to the attendants who stood about, and a feast
was served in plates of solid gold upon a table-cloth of silver--a feast
such as the beggar had never dreamed of, and the poor man ate as he had
never eaten in his life before.
All the while that the king and the beggar were eating, musicians played
sweet music and dancers danced and singers sang.
Then when the feast was over there came ten young men, bringing flasks
and flagons of all kinds, full of the best wine in the world; and the
beggar drank as he had never drank in his life before, and until his
head spun like a top.
So the king and the beggar feasted and made merry, until at last the
NA
he to the beggar, â€œall these things have been done to show you that Luck
and Fate, which have been against you for all these years, are now for
you. Hereafter, instead of being poor you shall be the richest of
the rich, for I will give you the greatest thing that I have in my

NA
the king, â€œhere is a purse, and in the purse are one hundred pieces of
gold money. But though that much may seem great to you, it is but little
of the true value of the purse. Its virtue lies in this: that however
much you may take from it, there will always be one hundred pieces of
gold money left in it. Now go; and while you are enjoying the riches
which I give you, I have only to ask you to remember these are not the
NA
But all the while he was talking the beggarâ€™s head was spinning and
spinning, and buzzing and buzzing, so that he hardly heard a word of
what the king said.
Then when the king had ended his speech, the lords and gentlemen who had
brought the beggar in led him forth again. Out they went through room
after room--out through the courtyard, out through the gate.
Bang!--it was shut to behind him, and he found himself standing in the
darkness of midnight, with the splendid clothes upon his back, and the
magic purse with its hundred pieces of gold money in his pocket.
He stood looking about himself for a while, and then off he started
homeward, staggering and stumbling and shuffling, for the wine that he
had drank made him so light-headed that all the world spun topsy-turvy
around him.
His way led along by the river, and on he went stumbling and staggering.
All of a sudden--plump! splash!--he was in the water over head and ears.
Up he came, spitting out the water and shouting for help, splashing and
sputtering, and kicking and swimming, knowing no more where he was than
the man in the moon. Sometimes his head was under water and sometimes it
was up again.
At last, just as his strength was failing him, his feet struck the
bottom, and he crawled up on the shore more dead than alive. Then,
through fear and cold and wet, he swooned away, and lay for a long time
for all the world as though he were dead.
Now, it chanced that two fisherman were out with their nets that night,
and Luck or Fate led them by the way where the beggar lay on the shore.
NA
turned him over, and then they saw what rich clothes he wore, and felt
that he had a purse in his pocket.
NA
clothes and his purse of money can do him no good now, and we might as
NA
beggar of all that the king had given him, and left him lying on the
beach.
At daybreak the beggar awoke from the swoon, and there he found himself
lying without a stitch to his back, and half dead with the cold and the
water he had swallowed. Then, fearing lest somebody might see him, he
crawled away into the rushes that grew beside the river, there to hide
himself until night should come again.
But as he went, crawling upon hands and knees, he suddenly came upon a
bundle that had been washed up by the water, and when he laid eyes upon
it his heart leaped within him, for what should that bundle be but the
patches and tatters which he had worn the day before, and which the
attendants had thrown over the garden wall and into the river when they
had dressed him in the fine clothes the king gave him.
He spread his clothes out in the sun until they were dry, and then he
put them on and went back into the town again.
NA
you think now? Am I not greater than Fate? Did I not make the beggar
rich? And shall I not paint my fatherâ€™s words out from the wall, and put
NA
NA
NA
NA
whether the beggar had done as he ought to do with the good things that
the king had given him. So they came to the towngate, and there, lo and
behold! the first thing that they saw was the beggar with his wooden
bowl in his hand asking those who passed by for a stray penny or two.
When the king saw him he turned without a word, and rode back home
NA
make the beggar rich and have failed; nevertheless, if I cannot make him
NA
So all that while the beggar sat at the towngate and begged until came
noontide, when who should he see coming but the same three men who had
NA
NA
reached him he was willing enough to go with them, rough as they were.
Off they marched; but this time they did not come to any garden with
fruits and flowers and fountains and marble baths. Off they marched,
and when they stopped it was in front of the kingâ€™s palace. This time
no nobles and great lords and courtiers were waiting for his coming;
but instead of that the town hangman--a great ugly fellow, clad in black
from head to foot. Up he came to the beggar, and, catching him by the
scruff of his neck, dragged him up the palace steps and from room to
room until at last he flung him down at the kingâ€™s feet.
When the poor beggar gathered wits enough to look about him he saw there
a great chest standing wide open, and with holes in the lid. He wondered
what it was for, but the king gave him no chance to ask; for, beckoning
with his hand, the hangman and the others caught the beggar by arms and
legs, thrust him into the chest, and banged down the lid upon him.
The king locked it and double-locked it, and set his seal upon it; and
there was the beggar as tight as a fly in a bottle.
They carried the chest out and thrust it into a cart and hauled it away,
until at last they came to the sea-shore. There they flung chest and
all into the water, and it floated away like a cork. And that is how the
king set about to ruin the poor beggar-man.
Well, the chest floated on and on for three days, and then at last it
came to the shore of a country far away. There the waves caught it up,
and flung it so hard upon the rocks of the sea-beach that the chest was
burst open by the blow, and the beggar crawled out with eyes as big as
saucers and face as white as dough. After he had sat for a while, and
when his wits came back to him and he had gathered strength enough, he
stood up and looked around to see where Fate had cast him; and far away
on the hill-sides he saw the walls and the roofs and the towers of the
great town, shining in the sunlight as white as snow.
NA
so saying and shaking the stiffness out of his knees and elbows, he
started off for the white walls and the red roofs in the distance.
At last he reached the great gate, and through it he could see the stony
streets and multitudes of people coming and going.
But it was not for him to enter that gate. Out popped two soldiers with
great battle-axes in their hands and looking as fierce as dragons. â€œAre
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œBecause no stranger enters here. Yonder is the pathway. You must take
NA
NA
NA
So off he marched without another word. On and on he went along the
narrow pathway until at last he came to a little gate of polished brass.
Over the gate were written these words, in great letters as red as
blood:
NA
Many and many a man besides the beggar had travelled that path and
looked up at those letters, and when he had read them had turned and
gone away again. But the beggar neither turned nor went away; because
why, he could neither read nor write a word, and so the blood-red
letters had no fear for him. Up he marched to the brazen gate, as boldly
as though it had been a kitchen door, and rap! tap! tap! he knocked upon
it. He waited awhile, but nobody came. Rap! tap! tap! he knocked again;
and then, after a little while, for the third time--Rap! tap! tap! Then
instantly the gate swung open and he entered. So soon as he had crossed
the threshold it was banged to behind him again, just as the garden gate
had been when the king had first sent for him. He found himself in a
long, dark entry, and at the end of it another door, and over it the
same words, written in blood-red letters:
NA
NA
NA
through.
It was fit to deafen a body! Such a shout the beggarâ€™s ears had never
heard before; such a sight the beggarâ€™s eyes had never beheld, for
there, before him, was a great splendid hall of marble as white as snow.
All along the hall stood scores of lords and ladies in silks and satins,
and with jewels on their necks and arms fit to dazzle a bodyâ€™s eyes.
Right up the middle of the hall stretched a carpet of blue velvet, and
at the farther end, on a throne of gold, sat a lady as beautiful as the
sun and moon and all the stars.
NA
deafened by the noise they all made, and the lady herself stood up and
smiled upon him.
Then there came three young men, and led the beggar up the carpet of
velvet to the throne of gold.

Meanwhile, while all these things were happening, the king of that other
country had painted out the words his father had written on the walls,
and had had these words painted in in their stead:

For a while he was very well satisfied with them, until, a week after,
he was bidden to the wedding of the Queen of the Golden Mountains; for
when he came there who should the bridegroom be but the beggar whom he
had set adrift in the wooden box a week or so before.
The bridegroom winked at him, but said never a word, good or ill, for he
was willing to let all that had happened be past and gone. But the king
saw how matters stood as clear as daylight, and when he got back home
again he had the new words that stood on the walls of the room painted
out, and had the old ones painted in in bigger letters than ever:

own, and who made her carry all the load of everything that happened to
NA
Where to Lay the Blame.
Many and many a man has come to trouble--so he will say--by following
his wifeâ€™s advice. This is how it was with a man of whom I shall tell
you.
There was once upon a time a fisherman who had fished all day long and
had caught not so much as a sprat. So at night there he sat by the fire,
rubbing his knees and warming his shins, and waiting for supper that his
wife was cooking for him, and his hunger was as sharp as vinegar, and
his temper hot enough to fry fat.
While he sat there grumbling and growling and trying to make himself
comfortable and warm, there suddenly came a knock at the door. The good
woman opened it, and there stood an old man, clad all in red from head
to foot, and with a snowy beard at his chin as white as winter snow.
The fishermanâ€™s wife stood gaping and staring at the strange figure,
but the old man in red walked straight into the hut. â€œBring your nets,
NA
you to catch for me, and if I have luck I will pay you for your fishing
NA
NA
fishing all day long until my back is nearly broken, and have caught
nothing, and now I am not such a fool as to go out and leave a warm fire
NA
But the fishermanâ€™s wife had listened to what the old man had said about
paying for the job, and she was of a different mind from her husband.
NA
NA
The fisherman shook his head. No, he would not go; he had said he would
not, and he would not. But the wife only smiled and said again, â€œMy

The fisherman grumbled and grumbled, and swore that he would not go. The
wife said nothing but one thing. She did not argue; she did not lose her
temper; she only said to everything that he said, â€œMy advice to you is

spitting his words at her; â€œif you will drive me out into the night, I

NA
Then down he took his fur cap and up he took his nets, and off he and
the old man marched through the moonlight, their shadows bobbing along
like black spiders behind them.
Well, on they went, out from the town and across the fields and through
the woods, until at last they came to a dreary, lonesome desert, where
nothing was to be seen but gray rocks and weeds and thistles.
NA
years, but never did I see as unlikely a place to catch anything as
NA
But the old man said never a word. First of all he drew a great circle
with strange figures, marking it with his finger upon the ground. Then
out from under his red gown he brought a tinder-box and steel, and a
little silver casket covered all over with strange figures of serpents
and dragons and what not. He brought some sticks of spice-wood from his
pouch, and then he struck a light and made a fire. Out of the box he
took a gray powder, which he flung upon the little blaze.
Puff! flash! A vivid flame went up into the moonlight, and then a dense
smoke as black as ink, which spread out wider and wider, far and near,
till all below was darker than the darkest midnight. Then the old
man began to utter strange spells and words. Presently there began a
rumbling that sounded louder and louder and nearer and nearer, until it
roared and bellowed like thunder. The earth rocked and swayed, and the
poor fisherman shook and trembled with fear till his teeth clattered in
his head.
Then suddenly the roaring and bellowing ceased, and all was as still as
death, though the darkness was as thick and black as ever.
NA
a journey such as no one ever travelled before. Heed well what I tell
you. Speak not a single word, for if you do, misfortune will be sure to
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
the fisherman.
NA
Thereupon he took from his pocket a handkerchief, and made ready to tie
it about the fishermanâ€™s eyes.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
But the old man tied the handkerchief tightly around his eyes, and then
he was as blind as a bat.
NA
NA
The fisherman reached down his hand, and there felt the back of
something rough and hairy. He flung his leg over it, and whisk! whizz!
off he shot through the air like a sky-rocket. Nothing was left for him
to do but grip tightly with hands and feet and to hold fast. On they
went, and on they went, until, after a great while, whatever it was
that was carrying him lit upon the ground, and there the fisherman found
himself standing, for that which had brought him had gone.
The old man whipped the handkerchief off his eyes, and there the
fisherman found himself on the shores of the sea, where there was
nothing to be seen but water upon one side and rocks and naked sand upon
the other.
NA
NA
The fisherman unrolled his nets and cast them and dragged them, and then
cast them and dragged them again, but neither time caught so much as
a herring. But the third time that he cast he found that he had caught
something that weighed as heavy as lead. He pulled and pulled, until
by-and-by he dragged the load ashore, and what should it be but a great
chest of wood, blackened by the sea-water, and covered with shells and
green moss.
That was the very thing that the magician had come to fish for.
From his pouch the old man took a little golden key, which he fitted
into a key-hole in the side of the chest. He threw back the lid; the
fisherman looked within, and there was the prettiest little palace that
manâ€™s eye ever beheld, all made of mother-of-pearl and silver-frosted as
white as snow. The old magician lifted the little palace out of the box
and set it upon the ground.
Then, lo and behold! a marvellous thing happened; for the palace
instantly began to grow for all the world like a soap-bubble, until it
stood in the moonlight gleaming and glistening like snow, the windows
bright with the lights of a thousand wax tapers, and the sound of music
and voices and laughter coming from within.
Hardly could the fisherman catch his breath from one strange thing
when another happened. The old magician took off his clothes and his
face--yes, his face--for all the world as though it had been a mask, and
there stood as handsome and noble a young man as ever the light looked
on. Then, beckoning to the fisherman, dumb with wonder, he led the way
up the great flight of marble steps to the palace door. As he came
the door swung open with a blaze of light, and there stood hundreds of
noblemen, all clad in silks and satins and velvets, who, when they
saw the magician, bowed low before him, as though he had been a king.
Leading the way, they brought the two through halls and chambers and
room after room, each more magnificent than the other, until they came
to one that surpassed a hundredfold any of the others.
At the farther end was a golden throne, and upon it sat a lady more
lovely and beautiful than a dream, her eyes as bright as diamonds, her
cheeks like rose leaves, and her hair like spun gold. She came half-way
down the steps of the throne to welcome the magician, and when the two
met they kissed one another before all those who were looking on. Then
she brought him to the throne and seated him beside her, and there they
talked for a long time very earnestly.
Nobody said a word to the fisherman, who stood staring about him like an

NA
he had come away from at home had left a sharp hunger gnawing at his
insides, and he longed for something good and warm to fill the empty
place. But time passed, and not so much as a crust of bread was brought
to stay his stomach.
By-and-by the clock struck twelve, and then the two who sat upon the

turning to those who stood around, said, in a loud voice, â€œBehold him
who alone is worthy to possess the jewel of jewels! Unto him do I give

that stood beside her, and brought thence a little crystal ball, about
as big as a pigeonâ€™s egg, in which was something that glistened like a
spark of fire. The magician took the crystal ball and thrust it into his
bosom; but what it was the fisherman could not guess, and if you do not
know I shall not tell you.
Then for the first time the beautiful lady seemed to notice the
fisherman. She beckoned him, and when he stood beside her two men came
carrying a chest. The chief treasurer opened it, and it was full of bags
NA

NA
NA

treasurer took a bag from the chest, untied it, and emptied a cataract
of gold into the fur cap. The fisherman had never seen so much wealth in
all his life before, and he stood like a man turned to stone.

Then the magician kissed the beautiful lady, and, beckoning to the
fisherman, left the throne-room the same way that they had come. The
noblemen, in silks and satins and velvets, marched ahead, and back they
went through the other apartments, until at last they came to the door.
Out they stepped, and then what do you suppose happened?
If the wonderful palace had grown like a bubble, like a bubble it
vanished. There the two stood on the sea-shore, with nothing to be seen
but rocks and sand and water, and the starry sky overhead.
The fisherman shook his cap of gold, and it jingled and tinkled, and was
as heavy as lead. If it was not all a dream, he was rich for life. â€œBut

The magician put on his red clothes and his face again, making himself
as hoary and as old as before. He took out his flint and steel, and
his sticks of spice-wood and his gray powder, and made a great fire and
smoke just as he had done before. Then again he tied his handkerchief

started upon our journey. Keep your mouth tight shut, for if you utter
so much as a single word you are a lost man. Now throw your leg over

The fisherman had his net over one arm and his cap of gold in the other
hand; nevertheless, there he felt the same hairy thing he had felt
before. He flung his leg over it, and away he was gone through the air
like a sky-rocket.
Now, he had grown somewhat used to strange things by this time, so he
began to think that he would like to see what sort of a creature it was
upon which he was riding thus through the sky. So he contrived, in spite
of his net and cap, to push up the handkerchief from over one eye. Out
he peeped, and then he saw as clear as day what the strange steed was.
He was riding upon a he-goat as black as night, and in front of him
was the magician riding upon just such another, his great red robe
fluttering out behind him in the moonlight like huge red wings.
NA
NA
Instantly goats, old man, and all were gone like a flash. Down fell the
fisherman through the empty sky, whirling over and over and around and
around like a frog. He held tightly to his net, but away flew his fur
cap, the golden money falling in a shower like sparks of yellow light.
Down he fell and down he fell, until his head spun like a top.
By good-luck his house was just below, with its thatch of soft
rushes. Into the very middle of it he tumbled, and right through the
thatch--bump!--into the room below.
The good wife was in bed, snoring away for dear life; but such a noise
as the fisherman made coming into the house was enough to wake the dead.
Up she jumped, and there she sat, staring and winking with sleep, and
with her brains as addled as a duckâ€™s egg in a thunder-storm.

All the good folk clapped their hands, not so much because of the story
itself, but because it was a woman who told it.

The Salt of Life.
Once upon a time there was a king who had three sons, and by the time
that the youngest prince had down upon his chin the king had grown so
old that the cares of the kingdom began to rest over-heavily upon his
shoulders. So he called his chief councillor and told him that he was of
a mind to let the princes reign in his stead. To the son who loved him
the best he would give the largest part of his kingdom, to the son who
loved him the next best the next part, and to the son who loved him the
least the least part. The old councillor was very wise and shook his
head, but the kingâ€™s mind had long been settled as to what he was about
to do. So he called the princes to him one by one and asked each as to
how much he loved him.
NA
was very pleased that his son should give him such love.
NA
king was pleased with that also.
But when the youngest prince was called, he did not answer at first, but
NA
NA
When the king heard what his youngest son said he was filled with anger.
NA
the most bitter of all things to the taste, and the cheapest and the
commonest of all things in the world? Away with you, and never let me
NA
The prince would have spoken, but the king would not allow him, and bade
his guards thrust the young man forth from the room.
Now the queen loved the youngest prince the best of all her sons, and
when she heard how the king was about to drive him forth into the wide
NA
him, â€œit is little or nothing that I have to give you. Nevertheless, I
have one precious thing. Here is a ring; take it and wear it always,
for so long as you have it upon your finger no magic can have power over
NA
Thus it was that the youngest prince set forth into the wide world with
little or nothing but a ring upon his finger.
For seven days he travelled on, and knew not where he was going or
whither his footsteps led. At the end of that time he came to the gates
of a town. The prince entered the gates, and found himself in a city
the like of which he had never seen in his life before for grandeur and
magnificence--beautiful palaces and gardens, stores and bazaars crowded
with rich stuffs of satin and silk and wrought silver and gold of
cunningest workmanship; for the land to which he had come was the
richest in all of the world. All that day he wandered up and down, and
thought nothing of weariness and hunger for wonder of all that he
saw. But at last evening drew down, and he began to bethink himself of
somewhere to lodge during the night.
Just then he came to a bridge, over the wall of which leaned an old man
with a long white beard, looking down into the water. He was dressed
richly but soberly, and every now and then he sighed and groaned, and as
the prince drew near he saw the tears falling--drip, drip--from the old
manâ€™s eyes.
The prince had a kind heart, and could not bear to see one in distress;
so he spoke to the old man, and asked him his trouble.
NA
like yourself. But the queen took him to sup with her, and I am left all
NA
NA
NA
NA
would know that no youth so chosen to sup with the queen ever returns to
NA
NA
day, and so do not understand these things. Even when I found you I was
NA
NA
NA
taking the prince by the arm, he led him across the bridge and to
another quarter of the town where he dwelt. He bade the servants prepare
a fine supper, and he and the prince sat down to the table together.
After they had made an end of eating and drinking, the old man told the
prince all concerning those things of which he had spoken, and thus it
was:
â€œWhen the king of this land died he left behind him three daughters--the
most beautiful princesses in all of the world.
â€œFolk hardly dared speak of the eldest of them, but whisperings said
that she was a sorceress, and that strange and gruesome things were done
by her. The second princess was also a witch, though it was not said
that she was evil, like the other. As for the youngest of the three, she
was as beautiful as the morning and as gentle as a dove. When she was
born a golden thread was about her neck, and it was foretold of her that
she was to be the queen of that land.
â€œBut not long after the old king died the youngest princess vanished--no
one could tell whither, and no one dared to ask--and the eldest princess
had herself crowned as queen, and no one dared gainsay her. For a while
everything went well enough, but by-and-by evil days came upon the land.
Once every seven days the queen would bid some youth, young and strong,
to sup with her, and from that time no one ever heard of him again, and
no one dared ask what had become of him. At first it was the great
folk at the queenâ€™s palace--officers and courtiers--who suffered; but
by-and-by the sons of the merchants and the chief men of the city began
NA
noble young men as could be found in the wide world. One day the chief
of the queenâ€™s officers came to my house and asked me concerning how
many sons I had. I was forced to tell him, and in a little while they
were taken one by one to the queenâ€™s palace, and I never saw them again.
â€œBut misfortune, like death, comes upon the young as well as the old.
You yourself have had trouble, or else I am mistaken. Tell me what
lies upon your heart, my son, for the talking of it makes the burthen
NA
The prince did as the old man bade him, and told all of his story; and
so they sat talking and talking until far into the night, and the old
man grew fonder and fonder of the prince the more he saw of him. So the
end of the matter was that he asked the prince to live with him as his
son, seeing that the young man had now no father and he no children, and
the prince consented gladly enough.
So the two lived together like father and son, and the good old man
began to take some joy in life once more.
But one day who should come riding up to the door but the chief of the
queenâ€™s officers.
NA
NA
It was of no use for the old man to tell the officer that the youth was
not his son, but was a prince who had come to visit that country. The
officer drew forth his tablets and wrote something upon them, and then
NA
NA
Sure enough, before three days had passed a bidding came to the prince
to make ready to sup with the queen that night.
When evening drew near a troop of horsemen came, bringing a white horse
with a saddle and bridle of gold studded with precious stones, to take
the prince to the queenâ€™s palace.
As soon as they had brought him thither they led the prince to a room
where was a golden table spread with a snow-white cloth and set with
dishes of gold. At the end of the table the queen sat waiting for him,
and her face was hidden by a veil of silver gauze. She raised the veil
and looked at the prince, and when he saw her face he stood as one
wonder-struck, for not only was she so beautiful, but she set a spell
upon him with the evil charm of her eyes. No one sat at the table but
the queen and the prince, and a score of young pages served them, and
sweet music sounded from a curtained gallery.
At last came midnight, and suddenly a great gong sounded from the
court-yard outside. Then in an instant the music was stopped, the pages
that served them hurried from the room, and presently all was as still
as death.
Then, when all were gone, the queen arose and beckoned the prince, and
he had no choice but to arise also and follow whither she led. She took
him through the palace, where all was as still as the grave, and so came
out by a postern door into a garden. Beside the postern a torch burned
in a bracket. The queen took it down, and then led the prince up a path
and under the silent trees until they came to a great wall of rough
stone. She pressed her hand upon one of the great stones, and it opened
like a door, and there was a flight of steps that led downward. The
queen descended these steps, and the prince followed closely behind her.
At the bottom was a long passage-way, and at the farther end the prince
saw what looked like a bright spark of light, as though the sun were
shining. She thrust the torch into another bracket in the wall of the
passage, and then led the way towards the light. It grew larger and
larger as they went forward, until at last they came out at the farther
end, and there the prince found himself standing in the sunlight and
not far from the seashore. The queen led the way towards the shore, when
suddenly a great number of black dogs came running towards them, barking
and snapping, and showing their teeth as though they would tear the two
in pieces. But the queen drew from her bosom a whip with a steel-pointed
lash, and as the dogs came springing towards them she laid about her
right and left, till the skin flew and the blood ran, and the dogs
leaped away howling and yelping.
At the edge of the water was a great stone mill, and the queen pointed
towards it and bade the prince turn it. Strong as he was, it was as much
as he could do to work it; but grind it he did, though the sweat ran
down his face in streams. By-and-by a speck appeared far away upon the
water; and as the prince ground and ground at the mill the speck grew
larger and larger. It was something upon the water, and it came nearer
and nearer as swiftly as the wind. At last it came close enough for him
to see that it was a little boat all of brass. By-and-by the boat struck
upon the beach, and as soon as it did so the queen entered it, bidding
the prince do the same.
No sooner were they seated than away the boat went, still as swiftly as
the wind. On it flew and on it flew, until at last they came to another
shore, the like of which the prince had never seen in his life before.
Down to the edge of the water ran a garden--but such a garden! The
leaves of the trees were all of silver and the fruit of gold, and
instead of flowers were precious stones--white, red, yellow, blue, and
green--that flashed like sparks of sunlight as the breeze moved them
this way and that way. Beyond the silver trees, with their golden fruit,
was a great palace as white as snow, and so bright that one had to shut
oneâ€™s eyes as one looked upon it.
The boat ran up on the beach close to just such a stone mill as the
prince had seen upon the other side of the water, and then he and
the queen stepped ashore. As soon as they had done so the brazen boat
floated swiftly away, and in a little while was gone.
NA
and well worth the seeing? Look at all these jewels and this gold, as
plenty as fruits and flowers at home. You may take what you please; but
while you are gathering them I have another matter after which I must
NA
So saying, she turned and left the prince, going towards the castle back
of the trees.
But the prince was a prince, and not a common man; he cared nothing for
gold and jewels. What he did care for was to see where the queen went,
and why she had brought him to this strange land. So, as soon as she had
fairly gone, he followed after.
He went along under the gold and silver trees, in the direction she had
taken, until at last he came to a tall flight of steps that led up to
the doorway of the snow-white palace. The door stood open, and into it
the prince went. He saw not a soul, but he heard a noise as of blows and
the sound as of some one weeping. He followed the sound, until by-and-by
he came to a great vaulted room in the very centre of the palace. A
curtain hung at the doorway. The prince lifted it and peeped within, and
this was what he saw:
In the middle of the room was a marble basin of water as clear as
crystal, and around the sides of the basin were these words, written in
letters of gold:
NA
Beside the fountain upon a marble stand stood a statue of a beautiful
woman made of alabaster, and around the neck of the statue was a thread
of gold. The queen stood beside the statue, and beat and beat it with
her steel-tipped whip. And all the while she lashed it the statue sighed
and groaned like a living being, and the tears ran down its stone cheeks
as though it were a suffering Christian. By-and-by the queen rested for
NA
NA
she had done before.
So she continued, now beating the statue and now asking it whether it
would give her the thread of gold, to which the statue always answered
NA
the queen wearied of what she was doing, and thrust the steel-tipped
lash back into her bosom again, upon which the prince, seeing that
she was done, hurried back to the garden where she had left him and
pretended to be gathering the golden fruit and jewel flowers.
The queen said nothing to him good or bad, except to command him to
grind at the great stone mill as he had done on the other side of the
water. Thereupon the prince did as she bade, and presently the brazen
boat came skimming over the water more swiftly than the wind. Again the
queen and the prince entered it, and again it carried them to the other
side whence they had come.
No sooner had the queen set foot upon the shore than she stopped and
gathered up a handful of sand. Then, turning as quick as lightning, she
NA
NA
And now it was that the ring that the princeâ€™s mother had given him
stood him in good stead. But for it he would have become a black dog
like those others, for thus it had happened to all before him who had
ferried the witch queen over the water. So she expected to see him
run away yelping, as those others had done; but the prince remained a
prince, and stood looking her in the face.
When the queen saw that her magic had failed her she grew as pale as
death, and fell to trembling in every limb. She turned and hastened
quickly away, and the prince followed her wondering, for he neither knew
the mischief she had intended doing him, nor how his ring had saved him
from the fate of those others.
So they came back up the stairs and out through the stone wall into
the palace garden. The queen pressed her hand against the stone and it
turned back into its place again. Then, beckoning to the prince, she
hurried away down the garden. Before he followed he picked up a coal
that lay near by, and put a cross upon the stone; then he hurried after
her, and so came to the palace once more.
By this time the cocks were crowing, and the dawn of day was just
beginning to show over the roof-tops and the chimney-stacks of the town.
As for the queen, she had regained her composure, and, bidding the
prince wait for her a moment, she hastened to her chamber. There she
opened her book of magic, and in it she soon found who the prince was
and how the ring had saved him.
When she had learned all that she wanted to know she put on a smiling

still smiling.
NA
NA
smiled so bewitchingly that the prince could not have refused her had he
desired to do so.
Alas for him! He thought no evil, but, without a word, drew off the ring
and gave it to the queen, and she slipped it upon her finger.

In an instant the prince was a prince no longer, but a coal-black raven.
The queen snatched up a sword that lay near by and struck at him to kill
him. But the raven-prince leaped aside and the blow missed its aim.
By good luck a window stood open, and before the queen could strike
again he spread his wings and flew out of the open casement and over the
house-tops and was gone.
On he flew and on he flew until he came to the old manâ€™s house, and so
to the room where his foster-father himself was sitting. He lit upon the
ground at the old manâ€™s feet and tried to tell him what had befallen,

try to fly away as he had expected, but bowed his neck to receive the
stroke. Then the old man saw that the tears were running down from the
NA
said. â€œSurely nothing but the living soul weeps; and how, then, can this

NA
me that something strange has happened. Tell me, is this not my

NA
understood it all, and the tears ran down his cheeks and trickled over
NA
and he held the raven close in his arms and caressed it.
He had a golden cage made for the bird, and every day he would walk with
it in the garden, talking to it as a father talks to his son.
One day when they were thus in the garden together a strange lady came
towards them down the pathway. Over her had and face was drawn a thick
veil, so that the two could not tell who she was. When she came close to
them she raised the veil, and the raven-prince saw that her face was the
living likeness of the queenâ€™s; and yet there was something in it that
was different. It was the second sister of the queen, and the old man
knew her and bowed before her.
NA
prince, whom the queen has bewitched. I also know nearly as much of
magic as she, and it is that alone that has saved me so long from ill.
But danger hangs close over me; the queen only waits for the chance to
bewitch me; and some day she will overpower me, for she is stronger
than I. With the princeâ€™s aid I can overcome her and make myself forever
safe, and it is this that has brought me here to-day. My magic is
powerful enough to change the prince back into his true shape again, and
I will do so if he will aid me in what follows, and this is it: I will
conjure the queen, and by-and-by a great eagle will come flying, and its
plumage will be as black as night. Then I myself will become an eagle,
with black-and-white plumage, and we two will fight in the air. After a
while we will both fall to the ground, and then the prince must cut off
the head of the black eagle with a knife I shall give him. Will you do

NA
NA
knew that he meant yes.
Therewith she drew a great, long keen knife from her bosom, and thrust

gathered up some sand in her hand, and flung it into the ravenâ€™s face.
NA
himself again. The next thing the sister of the queen did was to draw a
circle upon the ground around the prince, the old man, and herself. On
the circle she marked strange figures here and there. Then, all three
standing close together, she began her conjurations, uttering strange
words--now under her breath, and now clear and loud.
Presently the sky darkened, and it began to thunder and rumble. Darker
it grew and darker, and the thunder crashed and roared. The earth
trembled under their feet, and the trees swayed hither and thither as
though tossed by a tempest. Then suddenly the uproar ceased and all grew
as still as death, the clouds rolled away, and in a moment the sun shone
out once more, and all was calm and serene as it had been before. But
still the princess muttered her conjurations, and as the prince and the
old man looked they beheld a speck that grew larger and larger, until
they saw that it was an eagle as black as night that was coming swiftly
flying through the sky. Then the queenâ€™s sister also saw it and ceased
from her spells. She drew a little cap of feathers from her bosom with

clapped the feather cap upon her head. In an instant she herself became
an eagle--pied, black and white--and, spreading her wings, leaped into
the air.
For a while the two eagles circled around and around; but at last they
dashed against one another, and, grappling with their talons, tumbled
over and over until they struck the ground close to the two who stood
looking.
Then the prince snatched the knife from the ground and ran to where they

NA
NA
The prince needed no second telling to see the wisdom of what the old
man said. In an instant he struck off the heads of both the eagles, and
thus put an end to both sorceresses, the lesser as well as the greater.
They buried both of the eagles in the garden without telling any one of
what had happened. So soon as that was done the old man bade the prince
tell him all that had befallen him, and the prince did so.
NA
dogs are the young men who have supped with the queen; the statue is the
good princess; and the basin of water is the water of life, which has
the power of taking away magic. Come; let us make haste to bring help to

The prince needed no urging to do that. They hurried to the palace; they
crossed the garden to the stone wall. There they found the stone upon
which the prince had set the black cross. He pressed his hand upon it,
and it opened to him like a door. They descended the steps, and went
through the passageway, until they came out upon the sea-shore. The
black dogs came leaping towards them; but this time it was to fawn upon
them, and to lick their hands and faces.
The prince turned the great stone mill till the brazen boat came flying
towards the shore. They entered it, and so crossed the water and came to
the other side. They did not tarry in the garden, but went straight to
the snow-white palace and to the great vaulted chamber where was the

The prince said nothing, but he dipped up some of the water in his palm
and dashed it upon the statue. â€œIf you are the princess, take your true

became flesh and blood, and the princess stepped down from where
she stood, and the prince thought that he had never seen any one so
NA
NA
Then they all set their faces homeward again, and the prince took with
him a cupful of the water of life.
When they reached the farther shore the black dogs came running to meet
them. The prince sprinkled the water he carried upon them, and as soon
as it touched them that instant they were black dogs no longer, but the
tall, noble young men that the sorceress queen had bewitched. There, as
the old man had hoped, he found his own three sons, and kissed them with
the tears running down his face.
But when the people of that land learned that their youngest princess,
and the one whom they loved, had come back again, and that the two
sorceresses would trouble them no longer, they shouted and shouted for
joy. All the town was hung with flags and illuminated, the fountains ran
with wine, and nothing was heard but sounds of rejoicing. In the midst
of it all the prince married the princess, and so became the king of
that country.
And now to go back again to the beginning.
After the youngest prince had been driven away from home, and the old
king had divided the kingdom betwixt the other two, things went for a
while smoothly and joyfully. But by little and little the king was put
to one side until he became as nothing in his own land. At last hot
words passed between the father and the two sons, and the end of the
matter was that the king was driven from the land to shift for himself.
Now, after the youngest prince had married and had become king of that
other land, he bethought himself of his father and his mother, and
longed to see them again. So he set forth and travelled towards his old
home. In his journeying he came to a lonely house at the edge of a great
forest, and there night came upon him. He sent one of the many of those
who rode with him to ask whether he could not find lodging there for
the time, and who should answer the summons but the king, his father,
dressed in the coarse clothing of a forester. The old king did not know
his own son in the kingly young king who sat upon his snow-white horse.
He bade the visitor to enter, and he and the old queen served their son
and bowed before him.
The next morning the young king rode back to his own land, and then sent
attendants with horses and splendid clothes, and bade them bring his
father and mother to his own home.
He had a noble feast set for them, with everything befitting the
entertainment of a king, but he ordered that not a grain of salt should
season it.
So the father and the mother sat down to the feast with their son and
his queen, but all the time they did not know him. The old king tasted
the food and tasted the food, but he could not eat of it.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œand yet because I loved you as salt you disowned me and cast me out
NA
Therewith he could contain himself no longer, but with the tears running
down his cheeks kissed his father and his mother; and they knew him, and
kissed him again.
Afterwards the young king went with a great army into the country of
his elder brothers, and, overcoming them, set his father upon his throne
again. If ever the two got back their crowns you may be sure that they
wore them more modestly than they did the first time.
So the Fisherman who had one time unbottled the Genie whom Solomon the
Wise had stoppered up concluded his story, and all of the good folk who
were there began clapping their shadowy hands.

it is verily so that that which men call--love--is--the--salt--of--â€œ....
His voice had been fading away thinner and thinner and smaller and
smaller--now it was like the shadow of a voice; now it trembled and
quivered out into silence and was gone.
And with the voice of old Bidpai the pleasant Land of Twilight was also
gone. As a breath fades away from a mirror, so had it faded and vanished
into nothingness.
I opened my eyes.
There was a yellow light--it came from the evening lamp. There were
people of flesh and blood around--my own dear people--and they were
talking together. There was the library with the rows of books looking
silently out from their shelves. There was the fire of hickory logs
crackling and snapping in the fireplace, and throwing a wavering, yellow
light on the wall.
Had I been asleep? No; I had been in Twilight Land.
And now the pleasant Twilight Land had gone. It had faded out, and I was
back again in the work-a-day world.
There I was sitting in my chair; and, what was more, it was time for the
