1. The Shade of Cardinal Richelieu.
In a splendid chamber of the Palais Royal, formerly styled the Palais
Cardinal, a man was sitting in deep reverie, his head supported on his
hands, leaning over a gilt and inlaid table which was covered with
letters and papers. Behind this figure glowed a vast fireplace alive
with leaping flames; great logs of oak blazed and crackled on the
polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb habiliments
of the lonely tenant of the room, which was illumined grandly by twin
candelabra rich with wax-lights.
Any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar--the
gorgeous robe of office--and the rich lace, or who gazed on that pale
brow, bent in anxious meditation, might, in the solitude of that
apartment, combined with the silence of the ante-chambers and the
measured paces of the guards upon the landing-place, have fancied that
the shade of Cardinal Richelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt.
It was, alas! the ghost of former greatness. France enfeebled, the
authority of her sovereign contemned, her nobles returning to their
former turbulence and insolence, her enemies within her frontiers--all
proved the great Richelieu no longer in existence.
In truth, that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no
longer, was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which
seemed, as we have observed, more appropriate to a phantom than a living
creature--from the corridors deserted by courtiers, and courts crowded
with guards--from that spirit of bitter ridicule, which, arising from
the streets below, penetrated through the very casements of the room,
which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the
minister; as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns
firing--let off, happily, without other end or aim, except to show to
the guards, the Swiss troops and the military who surrounded the Palais
Royal, that the people were possessed of arms.
The shade of Richelieu was Mazarin. Now Mazarin was alone and
defenceless, as he well knew.
NA
byword of reproach--the watchword with which they assassinated, hanged,
and made away with Concini; and if I gave them their way they would
assassinate, hang, and make away with me in the same manner, although
they have nothing to complain of except a tax or two now and then.
Idiots! ignorant of their real enemies, they do not perceive that it is
not the Italian who speaks French badly, but those who can say fine
things to them in the purest Parisian accent, who are their real foes.

prove to me, indeed, that the destiny of favorites is precarious; but ye
shall know I am no ordinary favorite. No! The Earl of Essex, â€˜tis true,
wore a splendid ring, set with diamonds, given him by his royal
mistress, whilst I--I have nothing but a simple circlet of gold, with a
cipher on it and a date; but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of
the Palais Royal, * so they will never ruin me, as they long to do, and
whilst they shout, â€˜Down with Mazarin!â€™ I, unknown, and unperceived by
them, incite them to cry out, â€˜Long live the Duke de Beaufortâ€™ one day;
another, â€˜Long live the Prince de Conde;â€™ and again, â€˜Long live the

an expression of hatred, of which his mild countenance seemed incapable.

the parliament! Both Orleans and Montargis are ours. It will be a work
of time, but those who have begun by crying out: Down with Mazarin! will
finish by shouting out, Down with all the people I have mentioned, each
in his turn.
    _* It is said that Mazarin, who, though a cardinal, had not_
    _taken such vows as to prevent it, was secretly married to_
    _Anne of Austria.--La Porteâ€™s Memoirs._
â€œRichelieu, whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they now praise
after his death, was even less popular than I am. Often he was driven
away, oftener still had he a dread of being sent away. The queen will
never banish me, and even were I obliged to yield to the populace she
would yield with me; if I fly, she will fly; and then we shall see how
the rebels will get on without either king or queen.
â€œOh, were I not a foreigner! were I but a Frenchman! were I but of
NA
The position of the cardinal was indeed critical, and recent events had
added to his difficulties. Discontent had long pervaded the lower ranks
of society in France. Crushed and impoverished by taxation--imposed by
Mazarin, whose avarice impelled him to grind them down to the very
dust--the people, as the Advocate-General Talon described it, had
nothing left to them except their souls; and as those could not be sold
by auction, they began to murmur. Patience had in vain been recommended
to them by reports of brilliant victories gained by France; laurels,
however, were not meat and drink, and the people had for some time been
in a state of discontent.
Had this been all, it might not, perhaps, have greatly signified; for
when the lower classes alone complained, the court of France, separated
as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and the
bourgeoisie, seldom listened to their voice; but unluckily, Mazarin had
had the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold no less than
twelve appointments in the Court of Requests, at a high price; and as
the officers of that court paid very dearly for their places, and as the
addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower the value of
each place, the old functionaries formed a union amongst themselves,
and, enraged, swore on the Bible not to allow of this addition to their
number, but to resist all the persecutions which might ensue; and should
any one of them chance to forfeit his post by this resistance, to
combine to indemnify him for his loss.
Now the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending
parties.
On the seventh of January between seven and eight hundred tradesmen had
assembled in Paris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied on house
property. They deputed ten of their number to wait upon the Duke of
Orleans, who, according to his custom, affected popularity. The duke
received them and they informed him that they were resolved not to pay
this tax, even if they were obliged to defend themselves against its
collectors by force of arms. They were listened to with great politeness
by the duke, who held out hopes of easier measures, promised to speak in
their behalf to the queen, and dismissed them with the ordinary
NA
Two days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal
and their spokesman addressed Mazarin with so much fearlessness and
determination that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation
away with the same answer as it had received from the Duke of
Orleans--that he would see what could be done; and in accordance with
that intention a council of state was assembled and the superintendent
of finance was summoned.
This man, named Emery, was the object of popular detestation, in the
first place because he was superintendent of finance, and every
superintendent of finance deserved to be hated; in the second place,
because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred.
He was the son of a banker at Lyons named Particelli, who, after
becoming a bankrupt, chose to change his name to Emery; and Cardinal
Richelieu having discovered in him great financial aptitude, had
introduced him with a strong recommendation to Louis XIII. under his
assumed name, in order that he might be appointed to the post he
subsequently held.
NA
speak of Monsieur dâ€™Emery as calculated for a post which requires a man
of probity. I was really afraid that you were going to force that
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
This was the same Emery who became eventually superintendent of finance.
He was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and
trembling, declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the
day before, near the palace. The mob had insulted him on account of the
ostentatious luxury of his wife, whose house was hung with red velvet
edged with gold fringe. This lady was the daughter of Nicholas de Camus,
who arrived in Paris with twenty francs in his pocket, became secretary
of state, and accumulated wealth enough to divide nine millions of
francs among his children and to keep an income of forty thousand for
himself.
The fact was that Emeryâ€™s son had run a great chance of being
suffocated, one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he
gave up all the gold he had swallowed. Nothing, therefore, was settled
that day, as Emeryâ€™s head was not steady enough for business after such
an occurrence.
On the next day Mathieu Mole, the chief president, whose courage at this
crisis, says the Cardinal de Retz, was equal to that of the Duc de
Beaufort and the Prince de Conde--in other words, of the two men who
were considered the bravest in France--had been attacked in his turn.
The people threatened to hold him responsible for the evils that hung
over them. But the chief president had replied with his habitual
coolness, without betraying either disturbance or surprise, that should
the agitators refuse obedience to the kingâ€™s wishes he would have
gallows erected in the public squares and proceed at once to hang the
most active among them. To which the others had responded that they
would be glad to see the gallows erected; they would serve for the
hanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the
price of the peopleâ€™s misery.
Nor was this all. On the eleventh the queen in going to mass at Notre
Dame, as she always did on Saturdays, was followed by more than two
hundred women demanding justice. These poor creatures had no bad
intentions. They wished only to be allowed to fall on their knees before
their sovereign, and that they might move her to compassion; but they
were prevented by the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way,
haughtily disdainful of their entreaties.
At length parliament was convoked; the authority of the king was to be
maintained.
One day--it was the morning of the day my story begins--the king, Louis
XIV., then ten years of age, went in state, under pretext of returning
thanks for his recovery from the small-pox, to Notre Dame. He took the
opportunity of calling out his guard, the Swiss troops and the
musketeers, and he had planted them round the Palais Royal, on the
quays, and on the Pont Neuf. After mass the young monarch drove to the
Parliament House, where, upon the throne, he hastily confirmed not only
such edicts as he had already passed, but issued new ones, each one,
according to Cardinal de Retz, more ruinous than the others--a
proceeding which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the chief
president, Mole--whilst President Blancmesnil and Councillor Broussel
raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes.
The king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude to the Palais
Royal. All minds were uneasy, most were foreboding, many of the people
used threatening language.
At first, indeed, they were doubtful whether the kingâ€™s visit to the
parliament had been in order to lighten or increase their burdens; but
scarcely was it known that the taxes were to be still further increased,
NA
NA
that Broussel and Blancmesnil had made speeches in their behalf, and,
although the eloquence of these deputies had been without avail, it had
none the less won for them the peopleâ€™s good-will. All attempts to
disperse the groups collected in the streets, or silence their
exclamations, were in vain. Orders had just been given to the royal
guards and the Swiss guards, not only to stand firm, but to send out
patrols to the streets of Saint Denis and Saint Martin, where the people
thronged and where they were the most vociferous, when the mayor of
Paris was announced at the Palais Royal.
He was shown in directly; he came to say that if these offensive
precautions were not discontinued, in two hours Paris would be under
arms.
Deliberations were being held when a lieutenant in the guards, named
Comminges, made his appearance, with his clothes all torn, his face
streaming with blood. The queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise
and asked him what was going on.
As the mayor had foreseen, the sight of the guards had exasperated the
mob. The tocsin was sounded. Comminges had arrested one of the
ringleaders and had ordered him to be hanged near the cross of Du
Trahoir; but in attempting to execute this command the soldiery were
attacked in the market-place with stones and halberds; the delinquent
had escaped to the Rue des Lombards and rushed into a house. They broke
open the doors and searched the dwelling, but in vain. Comminges,
wounded by a stone which had struck him on the forehead, had left a
picket in the street and returned to the Palais Royal, followed by a
menacing crowd, to tell his story.
This account confirmed that of the mayor. The authorities were not in a
condition to cope with serious revolt. Mazarin endeavored to circulate
among the people a report that troops had only been stationed on the
quays and on the Pont Neuf, on account of the ceremonial of the day, and
that they would soon withdraw. In fact, about four oâ€™clock they were all
concentrated about the Palais Royal, the courts and ground floors of
which were filled with musketeers and Swiss guards, and there awaited
the outcome of all this disturbance.
Such was the state of affairs at the very moment we introduced our
readers to the study of Cardinal Mazarin--once that of Cardinal
Richelieu. We have seen in what state of mind he listened to the murmurs
from below, which even reached him in his seclusion, and to the guns,
the firing of which resounded through that room. All at once he raised
his head; his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has formed
a resolution; he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to
strike ten, and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the
table near him, he shrilled it twice.
A door hidden in the tapestry opened noiselessly and a man in black
silently advanced and stood behind the chair on which Mazarin sat.
NA
he knew that it was his valet-de-chambre who was behind him; â€œwhat

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The valet went out as silently as he had entered and appeared in a few
minutes bringing the dress demanded.
The cardinal, in deep thought and in silence, began to take off the
robes of state he had assumed in order to be present at the sitting of
parliament, and to attire himself in the military coat, which he wore
with a certain degree of easy grace, owing to his former campaigns in
Italy. When he was completely dressed he said:
NA
The valet went out of the room, this time by the centre door, but still
as silently as before; one might have fancied him an apparition.
When he was left alone the cardinal looked at himself in the glass with
a feeling of self-satisfaction. Still young--for he was scarcely
forty-six years of age--he possessed great elegance of form and was
above the middle height; his complexion was brilliant and beautiful; his
glance full of expression; his nose, though large, was well
proportioned; his forehead broad and majestic; his hair, of a chestnut
color, was curled slightly; his beard, which was darker than his hair,
was turned carefully with a curling iron, a practice that greatly
improved it. After a short time the cardinal arranged his shoulder belt,
then looked with great complacency at his hands, which were most elegant
and of which he took the greatest care; and throwing on one side the
large kid gloves tried on at first, as belonging to the uniform, he put
on others of silk only. At this instant the door opened.
NA
An officer, as he spoke, entered the apartment. He was a man between
thirty-nine and forty years of age, of medium height but a very well
proportioned figure; with an intellectual and animated physiognomy; his
beard black, and his hair turning gray, as often happens when people
have found life either too gay or too sad, more especially when they
happen to be of swart complexion.
Dâ€™Artagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment.
How perfectly he remembered his former entrance into that very room!
Seeing, however, no one there except a musketeer of his own troop, he
fixed his eyes upon the supposed soldier, in whose dress, nevertheless,
he recognized at the first glance the cardinal.
The lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but respectful posture,
such as became a man of good birth, who had in the course of his life
been frequently in the society of the highest nobles.
The cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather than serious glance,
yet he examined his countenance with attention and after a momentary
silence said:
NA
NA
Mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence, the play
of which had been, nevertheless, subdued by age and experience; and
Dâ€™Artagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly
sustained many a searching look, very different, indeed, from those
which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant.

NA
â€œI wish to visit in person the outposts which surround the Palais Royal;

The valet instantly brought to his master a regimental hat with a wide
brim. The cardinal put it on in military style.

turning to Dâ€™Artagnan.

â€œYou say that with four men you will undertake to disperse a hundred low
fellows; as it may happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred,

The valet held a wax-light; the cardinal took a key from his bureau and
opening the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the
Palais Royal.
2. A Nightly Patrol.
In ten minutes Mazarin and his party were traversing the street â€œLes
NA
NA
not of literature, had introduced into France the first opera that was
ever acted in that country.
The appearance of the town denoted the greatest agitation. Numberless
groups paraded the streets and, whatever Dâ€™Artagnan might think of it,
it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their
usual forbearance, in order to assume a warlike aspect. From time to
time noises came in the direction of the public markets. The report of
firearms was heard near the Rue Saint Denis and occasionally church
bells began to ring indiscriminately and at the caprice of the populace.
Dâ€™Artagnan, meantime, pursued his way with the indifference of a man
upon whom such acts of folly made no impression. When he approached a
group in the middle of the street he urged his horse upon it without a
word of warning; and the members of the group, whether rebels or not, as
if they knew with what sort of a man they had to deal, at once gave
place to the patrol. The cardinal envied that composure, which he
attributed to the habit of meeting danger; but none the less he
conceived for the officer under whose orders he had for the moment
placed himself, that consideration which even prudence pays to careless
courage. On approaching an outpost near the Barriere des Sergens, the
NA
NA
inquired if Lieutenant Comminges were not the commanding officer at the
outpost. The soldier replied by pointing out to him an officer who was
conversing, on foot, his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the
individual to whom he was talking sat. Here was the officer Dâ€™Artagnan
was seeking.
NA
cardinal. He instantly retired, from a feeling of respectful delicacy;
it was, however, evident that the cardinal was recognized by both
Comminges and the other officers on horseback.
NA
plainly that, notwithstanding the sixty-four years that have passed over
your head, you are still the same man, active and zealous. What were you
NA
NA
times and that to-dayâ€™s events are very like those in the days of the
Ligue, of which I heard so much in my youth. Are you aware that the mob
have even suggested throwing up barricades in the Rue Saint Denis and
NA
NA
NA
ingredient was wanting--in my opinion an essential one--a Duc de Guise;
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œIt seems that some days since Councillor Bachaumont remarked at the
palace that rebels and agitators reminded him of schoolboys
slinging--qui frondent--stones from the moats round Paris, young urchins
who run off the moment the constable appears, only to return to their
diversion the instant his back is turned. So they have picked up the
word and the insurrectionists are called â€˜Frondeurs,â€™ and yesterday
every article sold was â€˜a la Fronde;â€™ bread â€˜a la Fronde,â€™ hats â€˜a la
Fronde,â€™ to say nothing of gloves, pocket-handkerchiefs, and fans; but
NA
At that moment a window opened and a man began to sing:
    | â€œA tempest from the Fronde
    | Did blow toâˆ’day:
    | I think â€˜twill blow

NA
NA
revenge and longed to give back blow for blow, â€œshall I fire off a ball
to punish that jester, and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune
NA
And as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncleâ€™s
saddle-bow.
NA
friend, you are going to spoil everything--everything is going on
famously. I know the French as well as if I had made them myself. They
sing--let them pay the piper. During the Ligue, about which Guitant was
speaking just now, the people chanted nothing except the mass, so
everything went to destruction. Come, Guitant, come along, and letâ€™s see
NA
And waving his hand to Comminges he rejoined Dâ€™Artagnan, who instantly
put himself at the head of his troop, followed by the cardinal, Guitant
and the rest of the escort.
NA
NA
The street of Saint Honore, when the cardinal and his party passed
through it, was crowded by an assemblage who, standing in groups,
discussed the edicts of that memorable day. They pitied the young king,
who was unconsciously ruining his country, and threw all the odium of
his proceedings on Mazarin. Addresses to the Duke of Orleans and to
Conde were suggested. Blancmesnil and Broussel seemed in the highest
favor.
Dâ€™Artagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just
as if his horse and he had been made of iron. Mazarin and Guitant
conversed together in whispers. The musketeers, who had already
discovered who Mazarin was, followed in profound silence. In the street
of Saint Thomas-du-Louvre they stopped at the barrier distinguished by
the name of Quinze-Vingts. Here Guitant spoke to one of the subalterns,
asking how matters were progressing.
NA
NA
And he pointed to a magnificent hotel situated on the very spot whereon
the Vaudeville now stands.
NA
â€œI really donâ€™t know what hotel it is; all I do know is that I observed
NA
NA
NA
NA
said Mazarin; â€œdonâ€™t you know that I was in my youth a poet? I wrote

Guitantâ€™s shoulder. â€œMy good, my brave Guitant, whatsoever command I may
give you in that language--in French--whatever I may order you to do,
NA
â€œCertainly. I have already answered that question in the affirmative;

NA
NA
NA
reply.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan, in the meantime, had taken the head of his detachment
without a word and with that ready and profound obedience which marks
the character of an old soldier.
He led the way toward the hill of Saint Roche. The Rue Richelieu and the
Rue Villedot were then, owing to their vicinity to the ramparts, less
frequented than any others in that direction, for the town was thinly
inhabited thereabout.

NA
â€œDiavolo! Speak to him yourself, for ever since you were deputed by me
to arrest the Duc de Beaufort, this officer and I have been on bad

â€œI am aware of that, and I have told him a hundred times that he was

Guitant, without reply, rode forward and desired the sentinel to call

pensive mood, toward the Palais Royal. All that he had heard from these
three different men, Comminges, Guitant and Villequier, confirmed him in
his conviction that in case of serious tumults there would be no one on
his side except the queen; and then Anne of Austria had so often
deserted her friends that her support seemed most precarious. During the
whole of this nocturnal ride, during the whole time that he was
endeavoring to understand the various characters of Comminges, Guitant
and Villequier, Mazarin was, in truth, studying more especially one man.
This man, who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the
mob--not a muscle of whose face was stirred, either at Mazarinâ€™s
witticisms or by the jests of the multitude--seemed to the cardinal a
peculiar being, who, having participated in past events similar to those
now occurring, was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of
taking place.
The name of Dâ€™Artagnan was not altogether new to Mazarin, who, although
he did not arrive in France before the year 1634 or 1635, that is to
say, about eight or nine years after the events which we have related in
a preceding narrative, * fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of
one who was said to be a model of courage, address and loyalty.
NA
Possessed by this idea, the cardinal resolved to know all about
Dâ€™Artagnan immediately; of course he could not inquire from Dâ€™Artagnan
himself who he was and what had been his career; he remarked, however,
in the course of conversation that the lieutenant of musketeers spoke
with a Gascon accent. Now the Italians and the Gascons are too much
alike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them
may say of himself; so in reaching the walls which surrounded the Palais
Royal, the cardinal knocked at a little door, and after thanking
Dâ€™Artagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the Palais Royal,
he made a sign to Guitant to follow him.
They both dismounted, consigned their horses to the lackey who had
opened the door, and disappeared in the garden.

NA

â€œMonsieur dâ€™Artagnan? I have had no occasion to notice him particularly;
heâ€™s an old acquaintance. Heâ€™s a Gascon. De Treville knows him and
esteems him very highly, and De Treville, as you know, is one of the
queenâ€™s greatest friends. As a soldier the man ranks well; he did his
whole duty and even more, at the siege of Rochelle--as at Suze and

Here they separated and bidding adieu to Guitant in the court of the
Palais Royal, Mazarin approached an officer who was walking up and down
within that inclosure.
It was Dâ€™Artagnan, who was waiting for him.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase,
soon found himself in the study whence they had first set out.
The cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of
paper wrote some lines upon it, whilst Dâ€™Artagnan stood imperturbable,
without showing either impatience or curiosity. He was like a soldierly
automaton, or rather, like a magnificent marionette.
The cardinal folded and sealed his letter.

Dâ€™Artagnan took the letter, touched his hat with his hand, turned round
upon his heel like a drill-sergeant, and a moment afterward was heard,
in his dry and monotonous tone, commanding â€œFour men and an escort, a

and the horsesâ€™ shoes were heard resounding on the pavement of the
courtyard.
3. Dead Animosities.
Dâ€™Artagnan arrived at the Bastile just as it was striking half-past
eight. His visit was announced to the governor, who, on hearing that he
came from the cardinal, went to meet him and received him at the top of
the great flight of steps outside the door. The governor of the Bastile
was Monsieur du Tremblay, the brother of the famous Capuchin, Joseph,
that fearful favorite of Richelieuâ€™s, who went by the name of the Gray
Cardinal.
During the period that the Duc de Bassompierre passed in the
Bastile--where he remained for twelve long years--when his companions,
in their dreams of liberty, said to each other: â€œAs for me, I shall go
NA
the duke used to answer, â€œAs for me, gentlemen, I shall leave only when
NA
Du Tremblay would certainly lose his place at the Bastile and De
Bassompierre regain his at court.
His prediction was nearly fulfilled, but in a very different way from
that which De Bassompierre supposed; for after the death of Richelieu
everything went on, contrary to expectation, in the same way as before;
and Bassompierre had little chance of leaving his prison.
Monsieur du Tremblay received Dâ€™Artagnan with extreme politeness and
invited him to sit down with him to supper, of which he was himself
about to partake.
NA
mistaken, the words â€˜In haste,â€™ are written on the envelope of the

NA
NA
The unhappy wretch who entered the Bastile ceased, as he crossed the
threshold, to be a man--he became a number.
Dâ€™Artagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys; he remained on horseback,
feeling no inclination to dismount, and sat looking at the bars, at the
buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from
the other side of the moat, but by which he had for twenty years been
awe-struck.
A bell resounded.

smiling as he pronounced the imprecation; â€œI declare I feel quite ill
after only being five minutes in the courtyard. Go to! go to! I would
rather die on straw than hoard up a thousand a year by being governor of

He had scarcely finished this soliloquy before the prisoner arrived. On
seeing him Dâ€™Artagnan could hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise.
The prisoner got into the carriage without seeming to recognize the
musketeer.

and since there are no locks to the carriage, I shall sit beside him.

and placing himself by the side of the prisoner said, in a voice

The carriage drove on and Dâ€™Artagnan, availing himself of the darkness
in the archway under which they were passing, threw himself into the
arms of the prisoner.

NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, this is what actually took place: One evening after an orgy in
Reinardâ€™s apartment at the Tuileries with the Duc dâ€™Harcourt,
Fontrailles, De Rieux and others, the Duc dâ€™Harcourt proposed that we
should go and pull cloaks on the Pont Neuf; that is, you know, a
NA
NA
â€œNo, I was drunk. And yet, since the amusement seemed to me rather tame,
I proposed to Chevalier de Rieux that we should be spectators instead of
actors, and, in order to see to advantage, that we should mount the
bronze horse. No sooner said than done. Thanks to the spurs, which
served as stirrups, in a moment we were perched upon the croupe; we were
well placed and saw everything. Four or five cloaks had already been
lifted, with a dexterity without parallel, and not one of the victims
had dared to say a word, when some fool of a fellow, less patient than
the others, took it into his head to cry out, â€˜Guard!â€™ and drew upon us
a patrol of archers. Duc dâ€™Harcourt, Fontrailles, and the others
escaped; De Rieux was inclined to do likewise, but I told him they
wouldnâ€™t look for us where we were. He wouldnâ€™t listen, put his foot on
the spur to get down, the spur broke, he fell with a broken leg, and,
instead of keeping quiet, took to crying out like a gallows-bird. I then
was ready to dismount, but it was too late; I descended into the arms of
the archers. They conducted me to the Chatelet, where I slept soundly,
being very sure that on the next day I should go forth free. The next
day came and passed, the day after, a week; I then wrote to the
cardinal. The same day they came for me and took me to the Bastile. That
was five years ago. Do you believe it was because I committed the
NA
â€œNo; you are right, my dear Rochefort, it couldnâ€™t be for that; but you

NA
NA
NA
â€œI do not know. I did not even know that you were the person I was sent
NA
NA
NA
just as poor a Gascon as when I saw you at Meung, twenty-two years ago,
NA
NA
â€œBecause I happened to be in the ante-chamber when the cardinal called
me, by the merest chance. I am still a lieutenant in the musketeers and
NA
NA
â€œAnd what misfortune could happen to me? To quote some Latin verses I
have forgotten, or rather, never knew well, â€˜the thunderbolt never falls
on the valleys,â€™ and I am a valley, dear Rochefort,--one of the lowliest
NA
NA
â€œThe same as ever, my friend; it is said that he is married to the

â€œTherefore, whenever you find any opportunity of saying something in my

NA
NA
â€œApropos, are we to speak of your friends also, Athos, Porthos, and

NA
NA
â€œI donâ€™t know; we separated, as you know. They are alive, thatâ€™s all
that I can say about them; from time to time I hear of them indirectly,
but in what part of the world they are, devil take me if I know, No, on

â€œAnd the illustrious--whatâ€™s the name of the lad whom I made a sergeant

NA
NA
â€œI shouldnâ€™t wonder if he were at the head of the mob at this very
moment. He married a woman who keeps a confectionerâ€™s shop in the Rue
des Lombards, for heâ€™s a lad who was always fond of sweetmeats; heâ€™s now
a citizen of Paris. Youâ€™ll see that that queer fellow will be a sheriff

â€œCome, dear Dâ€™Artagnan, look up a little! Courage! It is when one is

NA
In five minutes the party entered the courtyard and Dâ€™Artagnan led the
prisoner up the great staircase and across the corridor and
ante-chamber.
As they stopped at the door of the cardinalâ€™s study, Dâ€™Artagnan was
about to be announced when Rochefort slapped him on his shoulder.
â€œDâ€™Artagnan, let me confess to you what Iâ€™ve been thinking about during
the whole of my drive, as I looked out upon the parties of citizens who
perpetually crossed our path and looked at you and your four men with
NA
NA
â€œI had only to cry out â€˜Help!â€™ for you and for your companions to be cut

NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan bowed. â€œIs it possible that Rochefort has become a better man
NA
the minister.
NA
names pronounced; â€œand beg M. dâ€™Artagnan to wait; I shall have further
NA
These words gave great joy to Dâ€™Artagnan. As he had said, it had been a
long time since any one had needed him; and that demand for his services
on the part of Mazarin seemed to him an auspicious sign.
Rochefort, rendered suspicious and cautious by these words, entered the
apartment, where he found Mazarin sitting at the table, dressed in his
ordinary garb and as one of the prelates of the Church, his costume
being similar to that of the abbes in that day, excepting that his scarf
and stockings were violet.
As the door was closed Rochefort cast a glance toward Mazarin, which was
answered by one, equally furtive, from the minister.
There was little change in the cardinal; still dressed with sedulous
care, his hair well arranged and curled, his person perfumed, he looked,
owing to his extreme taste in dress, only half his age. But Rochefort,
who had passed five years in prison, had become old in the lapse of a
few years; the dark locks of this estimable friend of the defunct
Cardinal Richelieu were now white; the deep bronze of his complexion had
been succeeded by a mortal pallor which betokened debility. As he gazed
at him Mazarin shook his head slightly, as much as to say, â€œThis is a

After a pause, which appeared an age to Rochefort, Mazarin took from a
bundle of papers a letter, and showing it to the count, he said:
â€œI find here a letter in which you sue for liberty, Monsieur de
NA
NA
said, â€œthat your eminence knew that circumstance better than any
NA
â€œI? Oh no! There is a congestion of prisoners in the Bastile, who were
cooped up in the time of Monsieur de Richelieu; I donâ€™t even know their
NA
â€œYes, but in regard to myself, my lord, it cannot be so, for I was
removed from the Chatelet to the Bastile owing to an order from your

NA
NA
â€œAh, stay! I fancy I remember it. Did you not once refuse to undertake a

â€œBut I do not say it was the cause of your imprisonment. I merely ask
you, did you not refuse to go to Brussels for the queen, whilst you had

â€œThat is the very reason I refused to go back to Brussels. I was there
at a fearful moment. I was sent there to intercept a correspondence
between Chalais and the archduke, and even then, when I was discovered I
was nearly torn to pieces. How could I, then, return to Brussels? I
NA
â€œWell, since the best motives are liable to misconstruction, the queen
saw in your refusal nothing but a refusal--a distinct refusal she had
also much to complain of you during the lifetime of the late cardinal;
NA
Rochefort smiled contemptuously.
â€œSince I was a faithful servant, my lord, to Cardinal Richelieu during
his life, it stands to reason that now, after his death, I should serve
NA
NA
not, like Monsieur de Richelieu, all-powerful. I am but a minister, who
wants no servants, being myself nothing but a servant of the queenâ€™s.
Now, the queen is of a sensitive nature. Hearing of your refusal to obey
her she looked upon it as a declaration of war, and as she considers you
a man of superior talent, and consequently dangerous, she desired me to
make sure of you; that is the reason of your being shut up in the
Bastile. But your release can be managed. You are one of those men who
can comprehend certain matters and having understood them, can act with

Rochefort bit his lips in order to prevent a smile.
â€œNow to the point. I want friends; I want faithful servants. When I say
I want, I mean the queen wants them. I do nothing without her
commands--pray understand that; not like Monsieur de Richelieu, who went
on just as he pleased. So I shall never be a great man, as he was, but
to compensate for that, I shall be a good man, Monsieur de Rochefort,

Rochefort knew well the tones of that soft voice, in which sounded
sometimes a sort of gentle lisp, like the hissing of young vipers.

but little evidence of that good-nature of which your eminence speaks.

â€œI am very desirous of being so, my lord, but I am totally in the dark

the opportunity of speaking of Dâ€™Artagnan--â€œwho by their sagacity and

about seven years ago, the third that I received from the same hand; it

NA

NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œBecause the secret does not belong to him; because, as I have told you,

â€œNo, my lord, he had three colleagues, three brave men, men such as you

â€œAs if they had been one man--as if their four hearts had pulsated in

NA
NA
NA
NA
that subtle countenance the cardinalâ€™s motive. â€œOnce upon a time there
lived a queen--a powerful monarch--who reigned over one of the greatest
kingdoms of the universe; and a minister; and this minister wished much
to injure the queen, whom once he had loved too well. (Do not try, my
lord, you cannot guess who it is; all this happened long before you came
into the country where this queen reigned.) There came to the court an
ambassador so brave, so magnificent, so elegant, that every woman lost
her heart to him; and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him
certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like
them.
â€œAs these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his
majesty to insist upon the queenâ€™s appearing in them as part of her
jewels at a ball which was soon to take place. There is no occasion to
tell you, my lord, that the minister knew for a fact that these
ornaments had sailed away with the ambassador, who was far away, beyond
seas. This illustrious queen had fallen low as the least of her

NA
â€œWell, my lord, four men resolved to save her. These four men were not
princes, neither were they dukes, neither were they men in power; they
were not even rich. They were four honest soldiers, each with a good
heart, a good arm and a sword at the service of those who wanted it.
They set out. The minister knew of their departure and had planted
people on the road to prevent them ever reaching their destination.
Three of them were overwhelmed and disabled by numerous assailants; one
of them alone arrived at the port, having either killed or wounded those
who wished to stop him. He crossed the sea and brought back the set of
ornaments to the great queen, who was able to wear them on her shoulder
on the appointed day; and this very nearly ruined the minister. What do

Mazarin made no reply; he reflected.

friends and not mine. He alone would have any influence with them; I do

â€œThat may be, my lord; but since I am neither king nor queen nor

4. Anne of Austria at the Age of Forty-six.
When left alone with Bernouin, Mazarin was for some minutes lost in
thought. He had gained much information, but not enough. Mazarin was a
cheat at the card-table. This is a detail preserved to us by Brienne. He
called it using his advantages. He now determined not to begin the game
with Dâ€™Artagnan till he knew completely all his adversaryâ€™s cards.
NA
NA
Bernouin took up a candlestick and led the way.
There was a secret communication between the cardinalâ€™s apartments and
those of the queen; and through this corridor* Mazarin passed whenever
he wished to visit Anne of Austria.
    _*This secret passage is still to be seen in the Palais Royal._
In the bedroom in which this passage ended, Bernouin encountered Madame
de Beauvais, like himself intrusted with the secret of these
subterranean love affairs; and Madame de Beauvais undertook to prepare
Anne of Austria, who was in her oratory with the young king, Louis XIV.,
to receive the cardinal.
Anne, reclining in a large easy-chair, her head supported by her hand,
her elbow resting on a table, was looking at her son, who was turning
over the leaves of a large book filled with pictures. This celebrated
woman fully understood the art of being dull with dignity. It was her
practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room, without
either reading or praying.
When Madame de Beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal,
the child, who had been absorbed in the pages of Quintus Curtius,
enlivened as they were by engravings of Alexanderâ€™s feats of arms,
frowned and looked at his mother.
NA
Anne colored slightly.
NA
inform the queen of all that is happening from time to time, without
NA
NA
â€œHow can you remember what Monsieur de Richelieu did? You were too young
NA
â€œI do not remember what he did, but I have inquired and I have been told
NA
NA
impatience.
NA
NA
At this very moment Mazarin entered. The king rose immediately, took his
book, closed it and went to lay it down on the table, near which he
continued standing, in order that Mazarin might be obliged to stand
also.
Mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful glance. They
explained what had occurred that evening.
He bowed respectfully to the king, who gave him a somewhat cavalier
reception, but a look from his mother reproved him for the hatred which,
from his infancy, Louis XIV. had entertained toward Mazarin, and he
endeavored to receive the ministerâ€™s homage with civility.
Anne of Austria sought to read in Mazarinâ€™s face the occasion of this
unexpected visit, since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only
after every one had retired.
The minister made a slight sign with his head, whereupon the queen said
to Madame Beauvais:
NA
The queen had several times already told her son that he ought to go to
bed, and several times Louis had coaxingly insisted on staying where he
was; but now he made no reply, but turned pale and bit his lips with
anger.
In a few minutes Laporte came into the room. The child went directly to
him without kissing his mother.
NA
NA
â€œI do not send you away, but you have had the small-pox and I am afraid
NA
â€œYou had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the
palace to-day to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to

NA
NA
NA
NA
Now Mancini was a nephew of Mazarinâ€™s and was as much hated by Louis as
the cardinal himself, although placed near his person by the minister.
And the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or
even bowing to the cardinal.
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhy, it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no
explanation. Besides, his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little
affection he has for me. That, however, does not hinder me from being
NA
NA
NA
The cardinal smiled.
NA

repeat, but the murderer of Chalais, of Montmorency and of Cinq-Mars,

he will win the game because he has a new adversary--instead of a man
who threatened, a man who smiles. But he is mistaken; I shall not leave

The queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung
there, and presented it to the cardinal.

one of which was stained with blood, alone met his gaze.

But Mazarin, notwithstanding this permission, instead of reading the
letters, took the knife which the dying Buckingham had snatched out of
the wound and sent by Laporte to the queen. The blade was red, for the
blood had become rust; after a momentary examination during which the
queen became as white as the cloth which covered the altar on which she
was leaning, he put it back into the coffer with an involuntary shudder.

NA

Mazarin, overcome by this determination, read the two letters. In one
the queen asked for the ornaments back again. This letter had been
conveyed by Dâ€™Artagnan and had arrived in time. The other was that which
Laporte had placed in the hands of the Duke of Buckingham, warning him
that he was about to be assassinated; that communication had arrived too
late.

him a superb diamond which sparkled on her finger.

him of his danger--he sold it to Monsieur des Essarts, on whose finger I

NA
A smile, which was indefinable, passed over the lips of the queen.
â€œSince you have no further interrogations to make, leave me, I beseech
NA
Mazarin bent low before her.
NA
NA
The cardinal took the queenâ€™s hand and pressed it with an air of
gallantry to his lips.
Scarcely had he left her when the queen went into her sonâ€™s room, and
inquired from Laporte if the king was in bed. Laporte pointed to the
child, who was asleep.
Anne ascended the steps side of the bed and softly kissed the placid
forehead of her son; then she retired as silently as she had come,
merely saying to Laporte:
â€œTry, my dear Laporte, to make the king more courteous to Monsieur le

5. The Gascon and the Italian.
Meanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room; and after asking
Bernouin, who stood at the door, whether anything had occurred during
his absence, and being answered in the negative, he desired that he
might be left alone.
When he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of
the ante-chamber. There Dâ€™Artagnan was asleep upon a bench.
The cardinal went up to him and touched his shoulder. Dâ€™Artagnan
started, awakened himself, and as he awoke, stood up exactly like a
soldier under arms.

And so saying, Mazarin extended his hand to the officer, who sighed as
he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the
night of the ball at the Hotel de Ville and which she had repurchased
from Monsieur des Essarts.

with himself; then, going to a large cupboard closed with a triple lock,
he took from it a bag of silver, and weighing it twice in his hands

He then withdrew, and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a
lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of money.

Meanwhile the cardinal was rubbing his hands in great satisfaction.

He returned to his room, and after depositing the ring in a casket
filled with brilliants of every sort, for the cardinal was a connoisseur
in precious stones, he called to Bernouin to undress him, regardless of
the noises of gun-fire that, though it was now near midnight, continued
to resound through Paris.
In the meantime Dâ€™Artagnan took his way toward the Rue Tiquetonne, where
he lived at the Hotel de la Chevrette.
We will explain in a few words how Dâ€™Artagnan had been led to choose
that place of residence.
6. Dâ€™Artagnan in his Fortieth Year.
Years have elapsed, many events have happened, alas! since, in our
NA
Rue des Fossoyeurs. Dâ€™Artagnan had not failed in his career, but
circumstances had been adverse to him. So long as he was surrounded by
his friends he retained his youth and the poetry of his character. He
was one of those fine, ingenuous natures which assimilate themselves
easily to the dispositions of others. Athos imparted to him his
greatness of soul, Porthos his enthusiasm, Aramis his elegance. Had
Dâ€™Artagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have
become a superior character. Athos was the first to leave him, in order
that he might retire to a little property he had inherited near Blois;
Porthos, the second, to marry an attorneyâ€™s wife; and lastly, Aramis,
the third, to take orders and become an abbe. From that day Dâ€™Artagnan
felt lonely and powerless, without courage to pursue a career in which
he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three
companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from
Heaven.
Notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers, Dâ€™Artagnan felt
completely solitary. For a time the delightful remembrance of Madame
Bonancieux left on his character a certain poetic tinge, perishable
indeed; for like all other recollections in this world, these
impressions were, by degrees, effaced. A garrison life is fatal even to
the most aristocratic organization; and imperceptibly, Dâ€™Artagnan,
always in the camp, always on horseback, always in garrison, became (I
know not how in the present age one would express it) a typical trooper.
His early refinement of character was not only not lost, it grew even
greater than ever; but it was now applied to the little, instead of to
the great things of life--to the martial condition of the
soldier--comprised under the head of a good lodging, a rich table, a
congenial hostess. These important advantages Dâ€™Artagnan found to his
own taste in the Rue Tiquetonne at the sign of the Roe.
From the time Dâ€™Artagnan took quarters in that hotel, the mistress of
the house, a pretty and fresh looking Flemish woman, twenty-five or
twenty-six years old, had been singularly interested in him; and after
certain love passages, much obstructed by an inconvenient husband to
whom a dozen times Dâ€™Artagnan had made a pretence of passing a sword
through his body, that husband had disappeared one fine morning, after
furtively selling certain choice lots of wine, carrying away with him
money and jewels. He was thought to be dead; his wife, especially, who
cherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow, stoutly maintained
that death had taken him. Therefore, after the connection had continued
three years, carefully fostered by Dâ€™Artagnan, who found his bed and his
mistress more agreeable every year, each doing credit to the other, the
mistress conceived the extraordinary desire of becoming a wife and
proposed to Dâ€™Artagnan that he should marry her.
NA
NA
NA
â€œHe was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us
NA
â€œAll right; if he comes back you will kill him, you are so skillful and
NA
NA
NA
NA
The pretty landlady was desolate. She would have taken Dâ€™Artagnan not
only as her husband, but as her God, he was so handsome and had so
fierce a mustache.
Then along toward the fourth year came the expedition of Franche-Comte.
Dâ€™Artagnan was assigned to it and made his preparations to depart. There
were then great griefs, tears without end and solemn promises to remain
faithful--all of course on the part of the hostess. Dâ€™Artagnan was too
grand to promise anything; he purposed only to do all that he could to
increase the glory of his name.
As to that, we know Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s courage; he exposed himself freely to
danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball
through the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of battle. He
had been seen falling from his horse and had not been seen to rise;
every one, therefore, believed him to be dead, especially those to whom
his death would give promotion. One believes readily what he wishes to
believe. Now in the army, from the division-generals who desire the
death of the general-in-chief, to the soldiers who desire the death of
the corporals, all desire some oneâ€™s death.
But Dâ€™Artagnan was not a man to let himself be killed like that. After
he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the
battle-field, the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself. He
gained a village, knocked at the door of the finest house and was
received as the wounded are always and everywhere received in France. He
was petted, tended, cured; and one fine morning, in better health than
ever before, he set out for France. Once in France he turned his course
toward Paris, and reaching Paris went straight to Rue Tiquetonne.
But Dâ€™Artagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man,
complete, except for the sword, arranged along the wall.
NA
It need not be said that Dâ€™Artagnan was still thinking of the husband.
He made inquiries and discovered that the servants were new and that the
mistress had gone for a walk.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
I have none. I must stay and follow the advice of my hostess, while
NA
He had just completed this monologue--which proves that in momentous
circumstances nothing is more natural than the monologue--when the
servant-maid, watching at the door, suddenly cried out:
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan looked out and at the corner of Rue Montmartre saw the
hostess coming along hanging to the arm of an enormous Swiss, who
tiptoed in his walk with a magnificent air which pleasantly reminded him
of his old friend Porthos.
NA
NA
conspicuous place.
The hostess, as she entered, saw Dâ€™Artagnan and uttered a little cry,
whereupon Dâ€™Artagnan, judging that he had been recognized, rose, ran to
her and embraced her tenderly. The Swiss, with an air of stupefaction,
looked at the hostess, who turned pale.
NA
distress.
NA
not in the slightest degree embarrassed in the role he was playing. And
without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the
Helvetian, who received him with great coldness.
NA
The hostess replied only by gasps.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The Swiss became as purple as a peony. He wore his elegant uniform,
Dâ€™Artagnan was wrapped in a sort of gray cloak; the Swiss was six feet
high, Dâ€™Artagnan was hardly more than five; the Swiss considered himself
on his own ground and regarded Dâ€™Artagnan as an intruder.
NA
like a man who begins to be seriously angry.
NA
NA
this little man should make a stand against that other man, who was so
large.
Dâ€™Artagnan, with a sudden accession of wrath, seized the lad by the ear
and led him apart, with the injunction:
â€œStay you where you are and donâ€™t you stir, or I will pull this ear off.
As for you, illustrious descendant of William Tell, you will straightway
get together your clothes which are in my room and which annoy me, and
NA
NA
NA

The hostess, who knew Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s skill with the sword, began to weep
and tear her hair. Dâ€™Artagnan turned toward her, saying, â€œThen send him

NA
Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s proposal, â€œpooh! who are you, in the first place, to ask me
NA
NA
consequently your superior in everything; only, as the question now is
not of rank, but of quarters--you know the custom--come and seek for
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan led away the Swiss in spite of lamentations on the part of
the hostess, who in reality found her heart inclining toward her former
lover, though she would not have been sorry to give a lesson to that
haughty musketeer who had affronted her by the refusal of her hand.
It was night when the two adversaries reached the field of battle.
Dâ€™Artagnan politely begged the Swiss to yield to him the disputed
chamber; the Swiss refused by shaking his head, and drew his sword.
NA
NA
words he drew in his turn and crossed swords with his adversary.
He had to contend against a strong wrist, but his agility was superior
to all force. The Swiss received two wounds and was not aware of it, by
reason of the cold; but suddenly feebleness, occasioned by loss of
blood, obliged him to sit down.
NA
be laid up more than a fortnight. Remain here and I will send you your
clothes by the boy. Good-by! Oh, by the way, youâ€™d better take lodging
in the Rue Montorgueil at the Chat Qui Pelote. You will be well fed
NA
Thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the Swiss
the things that belonged to him. The boy found him sitting where
Dâ€™Artagnan had left him, still overwhelmed by the coolness of his
adversary.
The boy, the hostess, and all the house had the same regard for
Dâ€™Artagnan that one would have for Hercules should he return to earth to
repeat his twelve labors.
But when he was alone with the hostess he said: â€œNow, pretty Madeleine,
you know the difference between a Swiss and a gentleman. As for you, you
have acted like a barmaid. So much the worse for you, for by such
conduct you have lost my esteem and my patronage. I have driven away the
Swiss to humiliate you, but I shall lodge here no longer. I will not
sleep where I must scorn. Ho, there, boy! Have my valise carried to the
NA
In saying these words Dâ€™Artagnan appeared at the same time majestic and
grieved. The hostess threw herself at his feet, asked his pardon and
held him back with a sweet violence. What more need be said? The spit
turned, the stove roared, the pretty Madeleine wept; Dâ€™Artagnan felt
himself invaded by hunger, cold and love. He pardoned, and having
pardoned he remained.
And this explains how Dâ€™Artagnan had quarters in the Rue Tiquetonne, at
the Hotel de la Chevrette.
Dâ€™Artagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood, finding a somewhat
lively pleasure in carrying Mazarinâ€™s bag of money and thinking of that
fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on
the ministerâ€™s finger that night.
NA
would turn it at once into money; I would buy with the proceeds certain
lands around my fatherâ€™s chateau, which is a pretty place, well enough,
but with no land to it at all, except a garden about the size of the
Cemetery des Innocents; and I should wait in all my glory till some rich
heiress, attracted by my good looks, rode along to marry me. Then I
should like to have three sons; I should make the first a nobleman, like
Athos; the second a good soldier, like Porthos; the third an excellent
abbe, like Aramis. Faith! that would be a far better life than I lead
now; but Monsieur Mazarin is a mean wretch, who wonâ€™t dispossess himself
NA
On entering the Rue Tiquetonne he heard a tremendous noise and found a
dense crowd near the house.
NA
Roe he found, however, that it was in front of the next house the mob
was collected. The people were shouting and running about with torches.
By the light of one of these torches Dâ€™Artagnan perceived men in
uniform.
He asked what was going on.
He was told that twenty citizens, headed by one man, had attacked a
carriage which was escorted by a troop of the cardinalâ€™s bodyguard; but
a reinforcement having come up, the assailants had been put to flight
and the leader had taken refuge in the hotel next to his lodgings; the
house was now being searched.
In his youth Dâ€™Artagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the
military, but he was cured of all those hot-headed propensities;
besides, he had the cardinalâ€™s hundred pistoles in his pocket, so he
went into the hotel without a word. There he found Madeleine alarmed for
his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening, but he
cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him
with it a bottle of good Burgundy.
He took his key and candle and went upstairs to his bedroom. He had been
contented, for the convenience of the house, to lodge in the fourth
story; and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just
above the gutter and below the roof. His first care on entering it was
to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money, and then
as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up
and sat down to table.
Not to reflect on what had passed, as one might fancy. No, Dâ€™Artagnan
considered that things are never well done when they are not reserved to
their proper time. He was hungry; he supped, he went to bed. Neither was
he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings
counsel with it. In the night he slept, but in the morning, refreshed
and calm, he was inspired with his clearest views of everything. It was
long since he had any reason for his morningâ€™s inspiration, but he
always slept all night long. At daybreak he awoke and took a turn around
his room.
NA
received a letter from Athos. Where was I then? Let me see. Oh! at the
siege of Besancon I was in the trenches. He told me--let me think--what
was it? That he was living on a small estate--but where? I was just
reading the name of the place when the wind blew my letter away, I
suppose to the Spaniards; thereâ€™s no use in thinking any more about
Athos. Let me see: with regard to Porthos, I received a letter from him,
too. He invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of
September, 1646. Unluckily, as I was then in Bearn, on account of my
fatherâ€™s death, the letter followed me there. I had left Bearn when it
arrived and I never received it until the month of April, 1647; and as
the invitation was for September, 1646, I couldnâ€™t accept it. Let me

Dâ€™Artagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room, and
which was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period of
two hundred years lost to his family. He uttered an exclamation of
delight, for the large handwriting of Porthos was discernible, and
underneath some lines traced by his worthy spouse.
Dâ€™Artagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter; it was dated
from the Chateau du Vallon.
Porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary; in his pride
he fancied that every one must know the Chateau du Vallon.
NA

idiot by this time from drinking. Aramis must have worn himself to a

He cast his eyes again on the letter. There was a postscript:
â€œI write by the same courier to our worthy friend Aramis in his

â€œIn his convent! What convent? There are about two hundred in Paris and
three thousand in France; and then, perhaps, on entering the convent he
changed his name. Ah! if I were but learned in theology I should
recollect what it was he used to dispute about with the curate of
Montdidier and the superior of the Jesuits, when we were at Crevecoeur;
I should know what doctrine he leans to and I should glean from that
what saint he has adopted as his patron.
â€œWell, suppose I go back to the cardinal and ask him for a passport into
all the convents one can find, even into the nunneries? It would be a
curious idea, and maybe I should find my friend under the name of
Achilles. But, no! I should lose myself in the cardinalâ€™s opinion. Great
people only thank you for doing the impossible; whatâ€™s possible, they
say, they can effect themselves, and they are right. But let us wait a
little and reflect. I received a letter from him, the dear fellow, in
which he even asked me for some small service, which, in fact, I

Dâ€™Artagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung
his old clothes. He looked for his doublet of the year 1648 and as he
had orderly habits, he found it hanging on its nail. He felt in the
pocket and drew from it a paper; it was the letter of Aramis:
â€œMonsieur Dâ€™Artagnan: You know that I have had a quarrel with a certain
gentleman, who has given me an appointment for this evening in the Place
Royale. As I am of the church, and the affair might injure me if I
should share it with any other than a sure friend like you, I write to
beg that you will serve me as second.
â€œYou will enter by the Rue Neuve Sainte Catherine; under the second lamp
on the right you will find your adversary. I shall be with mine under
the third.
â€œWholly yours,
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan tried to recall his remembrances. He had gone to the
rendezvous, had encountered there the adversary indicated, whose name he
had never known, had given him a pretty sword-stroke on the arm, then
had gone toward Aramis, who at the same time came to meet him, having

him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arcades.
So, then, he no more knew where Aramis was than where Athos and Porthos
were, and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity, when he
fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room window. He thought
directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was
sleeping. He was not mistaken; as he entered his bedroom a man was
getting in by the window.

NA
Planchet hesitated.
NA
NA
thither last night, when fortunately you did not accompany him, as his
carriage was crossing the Rue de la Ferronnerie his guards insulted the
people, who began to abuse them. The prisoner thought this a good
opportunity for escape; he called out his name and cried for help. I was
there. I heard the name of Rochefort. I remembered him well. I said in a
loud voice that he was a prisoner, a friend of the Duc de Beaufort, who
called for help. The people were infuriated; they stopped the horses and
cut the escort to pieces, whilst I opened the doors of the carriage and
Monsieur de Rochefort jumped out and soon was lost amongst the crowd. At
this moment a patrol passed by. I was obliged to sound a retreat toward
the Rue Tiquetonne; I was pursued and took refuge in the house next to
this, where I have been concealed between two mattresses. This morning I

And he seated himself at the table and ate as he did in the merry days
of the Rue des Fossoyeurs, whilst Dâ€™Artagnan walked to and fro and
thought how he could make use of Planchet under present circumstances.
While he turned this over in his mind Planchet did his best to make up
for lost time at table. At last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and
paused, as if he had partially appeased his hunger.

Dâ€™Artagnan opened the door and called out to a waiter to desire
Madeleine to come upstairs.
When the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at
seeing Planchet.

NA
The next moment Dâ€™Artagnan was on his way to Notre Dame.
7. Touches upon the Strange Effects a Half-pistole may have.
Dâ€™Artagnan, as he crossed the Pont Neuf, congratulated himself on having
found Planchet again, for at that time an intelligent servant was
essential to him; nor was he sorry that through Planchet and the
situation which he held in Rue des Lombards, a connection with the
bourgeoisie might be commenced, at that critical period when that class
were preparing to make war with the court party. It was like having a
spy in the enemyâ€™s camp. In this frame of mind, grateful for the
accidental meeting with Planchet, pleased with himself, Dâ€™Artagnan
reached Notre Dame. He ran up the steps, entered the church, and
addressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel, asked him if he knew
Monsieur Bazin.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan nearly jumped for joy; he had despaired of finding Bazin, but
now, he thought, since he held one end of the thread he would be pretty
sure to reach the other end.
He knelt down just opposite the chapel in order not to lose sight of his
man; and as he had almost forgotten his prayers and had omitted to take
a book with him, he made use of his time in gazing at Bazin.
Bazin wore his dress, it may be observed, with equal dignity and saintly
propriety. It was not difficult to understand that he had gained the
crown of his ambition and that the silver-mounted wand he brandished was
in his eyes as honorable a distinction as the marshalâ€™s baton which
Conde threw, or did not throw, into the enemyâ€™s line of battle at
Fribourg. His person had undergone a change, analogous to the change in
his dress; his figure had grown rotund and, as it were, canonical. The
striking points of his face were effaced; he had still a nose, but his
cheeks, fattened out, each took a portion of it unto themselves; his
chin had joined his throat; his eyes were swelled up with the puffiness
of his cheeks; his hair, cut straight in holy guise, covered his
forehead as far as his eyebrows.
The officiating priest was just finishing mass whilst Dâ€™Artagnan was
looking at Bazin; he pronounced the words of the holy Sacrament and
retired, giving the benediction, which was received by the kneeling
communicants, to the astonishment of Dâ€™Artagnan, who recognized in the
priest the coadjutor* himself, the famous Jean Francois Gondy, who at
that time, having a presentiment of the part he was to play, was
beginning to court popularity by almsgiving. It was to this end that he
performed from time to time some of those early masses which the common
people, generally, alone attended.
    _* A sacerdotal officer._
Dâ€™Artagnan knelt as well as the rest, received his share of the
benediction and made the sign of the cross; but when Bazin passed in his
turn, with his eyes raised to Heaven and walking, in all humility, the
very last, Dâ€™Artagnan pulled him by the hem of his robe.
Bazin looked down and started, as if he had seen a serpent.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI donâ€™t understand you, Bazin; nor can I see how I can be a

NA
NA
lost in thought Bazin retreated toward the sacristy, and even there he
could not think himself safe until he had shut and locked the door
behind him.
Dâ€™Artagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the
shoulder. He turned and was about to utter an exclamation of surprise
when the other made to him a sign of silence.
NA
NA
â€œI knew it from the fountain-head--from Planchet. And what brought you

And Rochefort went away with one of those diabolical smiles which used
formerly to make Dâ€™Artagnan shudder, but Dâ€™Artagnan could now see it
without alarm, and smiling in his turn, with an expression of melancholy
which the recollections called up by that smile could, perhaps, alone
give to his countenance, he said:
â€œGo, demon, do what thou wilt! It matters little now to me. Thereâ€™s no
NA
On his return to the cathedral, Dâ€™Artagnan saw Bazin, who was conversing
with the sacristan. Bazin was making, with his spare little short arms,
ridiculous gestures. Dâ€™Artagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence
with respect to himself.
Dâ€™Artagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade
at the corner of the Rue des Canettes; it was impossible that Bazin
should go out of the cathedral without his seeing him.
In five minutes Bazin made his appearance, looking in every direction to
see if he were observed, but he saw no one. Calmed by appearances he
ventured to walk on through the Rue Notre Dame. Then Dâ€™Artagnan rushed
out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see Bazin turn down the
Rue de la Juiverie and enter, in the Rue de la Calandre, a respectable
looking house; and this Dâ€™Artagnan felt no doubt was the habitation of
the worthy beadle. Afraid of making any inquiries at this house,
Dâ€™Artagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked
for a cup of hypocras. This beverage required a good half-hour to
prepare. And Dâ€™Artagnan had time, therefore, to watch Bazin unsuspected.
He perceived in the tavern a pert boy between twelve and fifteen years
of age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the
guise of a chorister. He questioned him, and as the boy had no interest
in deceiving, Dâ€™Artagnan learned that he exercised, from six oâ€™clock in
the morning until nine, the office of chorister, and from nine oâ€™clock
till midnight that of a waiter in the tavern.
Whilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of
Bazinâ€™s house. It was saddled and bridled. Almost immediately Bazin came
downstairs.

NA
NA
NA
NA
where Bazin is going? That is not difficult. You are not joking, are

NA
showed him the seductive coin, but did not give it him.
NA
â€œJust the very way not to know. Wait till he is set out and then, marry,
NA
back again into his pocket.
NA
NA
They had not long to wait. Five minutes afterward Bazin set off on a
full trot, urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie, which he was
in the habit of using instead of a riding whip.
Scarcely had he turned the corner of the Rue de la Juiverie when the boy
rushed after him like a bloodhound on full scent.
Before ten minutes had elapsed the child returned.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The child put the piece of money into his pocket.
NA
NA
NA
â€œAh, faith! there was no great cunning necessary. I knew the horse he
rode; it belonged to the butcher, who lets it out now and then to M.
Bazin. Now I thought that the butcher would not let his horse out like
that without knowing where it was going. And he answered â€˜that Monsieur
Bazin went to Noisy.â€™ â€˜Tis his custom. He goes two or three times a

NA

Dâ€™Artagnan wrote the childâ€™s name in his tablets.

And having got out all he wanted, he paid for the hypocras, which he did
not drink, and went quickly back to the Rue Tiquetonne.
8. Dâ€™Artagnan, Going to a Distance to discover Aramis.
On entering the hotel Dâ€™Artagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the
fire. It was Planchet, but so completely transformed, thanks to the old
clothes that the departing husband had left behind, that Dâ€™Artagnan
himself could hardly recognize him. Madeleine introduced him in presence
of all the servants. Planchet addressed the officer with a fine Flemish
phrase; the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at
all, and the bargain was concluded; Madeleineâ€™s brother entered
Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s service.
The plan adopted by Dâ€™Artagnan was soon perfected. He resolved not to
reach Noisy in the day, for fear of being recognized; he had therefore
plenty of time before him, for Noisy is only three or four leagues from
Paris, on the road to Meaux.
He began his day by breakfasting substantially--a bad beginning when one
wants to employ the head, but an excellent precaution when one wants to
work the body; and about two oâ€™clock he had his two horses saddled, and
followed by Planchet he quitted Paris by the Barriere de la Villete. A
most active search was still prosecuted in the house near the Hotel de
la Chevrette for the discovery of Planchet.
At about a league and a half from the city, Dâ€™Artagnan, finding that in
his impatience he had set out too soon, stopped to give the horses
breathing time. The inn was full of disreputable looking people, who
seemed as if they were on the point of commencing some nightly
expedition. A man, wrapped in a cloak, appeared at the door, but seeing
a stranger he beckoned to his companions, and two men who were drinking
in the inn went out to speak to him.
Dâ€™Artagnan, on his side, went up to the landlady, praised her
wine--which was a horrible production from the country of Montreuil--and
heard from her that there were only two houses of importance in the
village; one of these belonged to the Archbishop of Paris, and was at
that time the abode of his niece the Duchess of Longueville; the other
was a convent of Jesuits and was the property--a by no means unusual
circumstance--of these worthy fathers.
At four oâ€™clock Dâ€™Artagnan recommenced his journey. He proceeded slowly
and in deep reverie. Planchet also was lost in thought, but the subject
of their reflections was not the same.
One word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn
to Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s deliberations; this was the name of Madame de
Longueville.
That name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce thought.
Madame de Longueville was one of the highest ladies in the realm; she
was also one of the greatest beauties at court. She had formerly been
suspected of an intimacy of too tender a nature with Coligny, who, for
her sake, had been killed in a duel, in the Place Royale, by the Duc de
Guise. She was now connected by bonds of a political nature with the
Prince de Marsillac, the eldest son of the old Duc de Rochefoucauld,
whom she was trying to inspire with an enmity toward the Duc de Conde,
her brother-in-law, whom she now hated mortally.
Dâ€™Artagnan thought of all these matters. He remembered how at the Louvre
he had often seen, as she passed by him in the full radiance of her
dazzling charms, the beautiful Madame de Longueville. He thought of
Aramis, who, without possessing any greater advantages than himself, had
formerly been the lover of Madame de Chevreuse, who had been to a former
court what Madame de Longueville was in that day; and he wondered how it
was that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish,
some in ambition, others in love, whilst others, either from chance, or
from ill-luck, or from some natural defect or impediment, remain
half-way upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and
expectations.
He was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy
class, when Planchet approached and said:
â€œI will lay a wager, your honor, that you and I are thinking of the same
NA
NA
NA
â€œI am thinking, sir, of those desperate looking men who were drinking in
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œSir, my instinct told me that those people were assembled there for
some bad purpose; and I was reflecting on what my instinct had told me,
in the darkest corner of the stable, when a man wrapped in a cloak and
NA
NA
NA
â€œOne of these two men said, â€˜He must certainly be at Noisy, or be coming
there this evening, for I have seen his servant.â€™
â€œâ€˜Art thou sure?â€™ said the man in the cloak.
NA
NA
â€œYes, â€˜my prince;â€™ but listen. â€˜If he is hereâ€™--this is what the other
man said--â€˜letâ€™s see decidedly what to do with him.â€™
â€œâ€˜What to do with him?â€™ answered the prince.
â€œâ€˜Yes, heâ€™s not a man to allow himself to be taken anyhow; heâ€™ll defend
himself.â€™
â€œâ€˜Well, we must try to take him alive. Have you cords to bind him with
and a gag to stop his mouth?â€™
â€œâ€˜We have.â€™
â€œâ€˜Remember that he will most likely be disguised as a horseman.â€™
â€œâ€˜Yes, yes, my lord; donâ€™t be uneasy.â€™
â€œâ€˜Besides, I shall be there.â€™
â€œâ€˜You will assure us that justice----â€™
â€œâ€˜Yes, yes! I answer for all that,â€™ the prince said.
â€œâ€˜Well, then, weâ€™ll do our best.â€™ Having said that, they went out of the
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œJust remember what they said. â€˜I have seen his servant,â€™ said one, and
NA
NA
â€œâ€˜He must certainly be at Noisy, or be coming there this evening,â€™ said
NA
NA
â€œThen the prince said: â€˜Take notice that in all probability he will be
disguised as a cavalier;â€™ which seems to me to leave no room for doubt,
since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers.
NA
NA
unfortunately no longer in those times in which princes would care to
assassinate me. Those were good old days; never fear--these people owe
NA
NA
NA
NA
in Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s suite with that sublime confidence he had always had in
his master, which even fifteen years of separation had not destroyed.
They had traveled onward about half a mile when Planchet came close up
to Dâ€™Artagnan.
NA
NA
NA
NA
At this moment the neighing of a horse struck his ear, coming through
darkness and space.
NA
NA
At about half-past eight oâ€™clock they reached the first houses in Noisy;
every one was in bed and not a light was to be seen in the village. The
obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the
roofs of houses. Here and there a dog barked behind a door or an
affrighted cat fled precipitately from the midst of the pavement to take
refuge behind a pile of faggots, from which retreat her eyes would shine
like peridores. These were the only living creatures that seemed to
inhabit the village.
Toward the middle of the town, commanding the principal open space, rose
a dark mass, separated from the rest of the world by two lanes and
overshadowed in the front by enormous lime-trees. Dâ€™Artagnan looked
attentively at the building.
NA

â€œThe convent, your honor, is at the other end of the village; I know it

In about five minutes Planchet returned.

NA

and should have a good supper there, too; whereas, â€˜tis very possible
that between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
There came a sound like a whirlwind, at the same time two troops of
horsemen, each composed of ten men, sallied forth from each of the lanes
which encompassed the house and surrounded Dâ€™Artagnan and Planchet.
NA
his horse; â€œare you not mistaken? is it really for us that you mean your

NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the conversation.

NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAh! just so, gentlemen! pray, do people get into a passion at random at
Noisy? Take care, for I warn you that the first man that comes within

Gascon, who did not choose to seem to yield to a threat. â€œDo you know

NA
And the troop, grumbling angrily, disappeared in the darkness and took
the road to Paris. Dâ€™Artagnan and Planchet remained for some moments
still on the defensive; then, as the noise of the horsemen became more
and more distant, they sheathed their swords.
NA
NA
NA
â€œIâ€™faith! I neither know nor care. What I do care for now, is to make my
way into the Jesuitsâ€™ convent; so to horse and let us knock at their

And he mounted his horse. Planchet had just done the same when an
unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse, which sank down.

Dâ€™Artagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on Planchetâ€™s
horse.

preparing to attack the new foe.

And Planchet, with Aramis behind him, set off at full gallop, followed
by Dâ€™Artagnan, who began to think he was in the merry maze of some
fantastic dream.
9. The Abbe Dâ€™Herblay.
At the extremity of the village Planchet turned to the left in obedience
to the orders of Aramis, and stopped underneath the window which had
light in it. Aramis alighted and clapped his hands three times.
Immediately the window was opened and a ladder of rope was let down from
it.

convents, or what evil ways all these men of the church have, with whom

â€œAs the late cardinal used to say to the late king, â€˜only to show you

Dâ€™Artagnan followed, but less nimbly, showing plainly that this mode of
ascent was not one to which he was accustomed.
NA
known that I was to have the honor of your visit I should have procured
NA
NA
â€œthis way is easy for Monsieur Aramis and even for you; in case of
necessity I might also climb up, but my two horses cannot mount the

building on the plain; â€œthere you will find hay and straw for them; then
come back here and clap your hands three times, and we will give you
NA
And Aramis, drawing in the ladder, closed the window. Dâ€™Artagnan then
looked around attentively.
Never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more
elegant. At each corner were arranged trophies, presenting to view
swords of all sorts, and on the walls hung four great pictures
representing in their ordinary military costume the Cardinal de
Lorraine, the Cardinal de Richelieu, the Cardinal de la Valette, and the
Archbishop of Bordeaux. Exteriorly, nothing in the room showed that it
was the habitation of an abbe. The hangings were of damask, the carpets
from Alencon, and the bed, especially, had more the look of a fine
ladyâ€™s couch, with its trimmings of fine lace and its embroidered
counterpane, than that of a man who had made a vow that he would
endeavor to gain Heaven by fasting and mortification.

NA
â€œI am looking for the person who let down the ladder. I see no one and

NA
now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of Paradise;
some place it on Mount Ararat, others between the rivers Tigris and
Euphrates; it seems that they have been looking very far away for it,
while it was actually very near. Paradise is at Noisy le Sec, upon the
site of the archbishopâ€™s chateau. People do not go out from it by the
door, but by the window; one doesnâ€™t descend here by the marble steps of
a peristyle, but by the branches of a lime-tree; and the angel with a
flaming sword who guards this elysium seems to have changed his
celestial name of Gabriel into that of the more terrestrial one of the

who, having but one chamber, and taking her for a cavalier, offered to
share it with her. For she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man,
that dear Marie; I know only one other woman who can do it as well. So
they made this song about her: â€˜Laboissiere, dis moi.â€™ You know it,

Aramis immediately complied, and sang the song in a very lively manner.

NA
â€œHave I not already told you that there is nothing between me and the
Duchess de Longueville? Little flirtations, perhaps, and thatâ€™s all. No,
I spoke of the Duchess de Chevreuse; did you see her after her return

advice, by which she did not profit. I ventured to tell her that Mazarin
was the lover of Anne of Austria. She wouldnâ€™t believe me, saying that
she knew Anne of Austria, who was too proud to love such a worthless
coxcomb. After that she plunged into the cabal headed by the Duke of
Beaufort; and the â€˜coxcombâ€™ arrested De Beaufort and banished Madame de
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes she is come back and is going to commit some fresh folly or

NA
NA
NA
â€œIn that respect unlike you, my dear Aramis, for you are still the same;
you have still your beautiful dark hair, still your elegant figure,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œFormerly I was your junior by two or three years, and if I am not
NA
â€œIndeed! Then â€˜tis I who am mistaken, for you have always been a good
chronologist. By your reckoning I must be forty-three at least. The
devil I am! Donâ€™t let it out at the Hotel Rambouillet; it would ruin

NA
NA
NA
Bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each hand.
NA
NA
NA
â€œBecause you always think you have on your shoulders your beadleâ€™s robe,
and spend all your time reading your breviary. But I give you warning
that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up
my sword, I will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see
NA
Bazin, scandalized, made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his
hand. Dâ€™Artagnan, more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of
the Abbe dâ€™Herblay, which contrasted so strongly with those of the
Musketeer Aramis, remained staring with wide-open eyes at the face of
his friend.
Bazin quickly covered the table with a damask cloth and arranged upon it
so many things, gilded, perfumed, appetizing, that Dâ€™Artagnan was quite
overcome.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œFrom Master Bazin, to be sure; he took you for the devil, my dear
fellow, and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if
NA
NA
â€œCome, no hypocrisy! you know that I donâ€™t like it. You will do much
better to open the window and let down some bread, a chicken and a
bottle of wine to your friend Planchet, who has been this last hour
NA
Planchet, in fact, had bedded and fed his horses, and then coming back
under the window had repeated two or three times the signal agreed upon.
Bazin obeyed, fastened to the end of a cord the three articles
designated and let them down to Planchet, who then went satisfied to his
shed.
NA
The two friends sat down and Aramis began to cut up fowls, partridges
and hams with admirable skill.
NA
â€œYes, pretty well. The coadjutor has given me dispensations from fasting
on the jours maigres, on account of my health; then I have engaged as my
cook the cook who lived with Lafollone--you know the man I mean?--the
friend of the cardinal, and the famous epicure whose grace after dinner
used to be, â€˜Good Lord, do me the favor to cause me to digest what I

NA
Dâ€™Artagnan.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œOh, Heaven! no. I make about twelve thousand francs a year, without

NA
â€œNo, I have given up poetry, except now and then to write a drinking
song, some gay sonnet or some innocent epigram; I compose sermons, my
NA
NA
NA
â€œAh, indeed! and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation
NA
â€œI should, my dear Dâ€™Artagnan, have been so, but nature said â€˜No.â€™ When
I am in the pulpit, if by chance a pretty woman looks at me, I look at
her again: if she smiles, I smile too. Then I speak at random; instead
of preaching about the torments of hell I talk of the joys of Paradise.
An event took place in the Church of St. Louis au Marais. A gentleman
laughed in my face. I stopped short to tell him that he was a fool; the
congregation went out to get stones to stone me with, but whilst they
were away I found means to conciliate the priests who were present, so
that my foe was pelted instead of me. â€˜Tis true that he came the next
morning to my house, thinking that he had to do with an abbe--like all
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI donâ€™t know. But, at all events, I gave him absolution in articulo
NA
Bazin made a despairing sign which meant that while perhaps he approved
the moral he altogether disapproved the tone in which it was uttered.
NA
see you in that mirror, and you forget that once for all I have
forbidden all signs of approbation or disapprobation. You will do me the
favor to bring us some Spanish wine and then to withdraw. Besides, my
friend Dâ€™Artagnan has something to say to me privately, have you not,
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan nodded his head and Bazin retired, after placing on the table
the Spanish wine.
The two friends, left alone, remained silent, face to face. Aramis
seemed to await a comfortable digestion; Dâ€™Artagnan, to be preparing his
exordium. Each of them, when the other was not looking, hazarded a sly
glance. It was Aramis who broke the silence.
NA
â€œI was thinking, my dear old friend, that when you were a musketeer you
turned your thoughts incessantly to the church, and now that you are an
NA
NA
up of contradictions. Since I became an abbe I dream of nothing but

â€œThat is apparent in your surroundings; you have rapiers here of every

â€œThen you would have killed Monsieur de Marsillac if he had come alone

â€œWell, I sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to

â€œOf which I invite you to take advantage, my friend. Let us see; with
your thousand crowns from the abbey and the twelve thousand francs you

â€œI? I am as poor as Job, and were you to search my pockets and my boxes

NA
being as poor as Job! If I had them I should think myself as rich as
NA
NA
â€œWell, my friend, I bring you the means of becoming rich, powerful, and
NA
The shadow of a cloud passed over Aramisâ€™s face as quickly as that which
in August passes over the field of grain; but quick as it was, it did
not escape Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s observation.
NA
NA
A gleam of light shone in Aramisâ€™s eyes, as brief as the shadow that had
passed over his face, but not so brief but that it was seen by
Dâ€™Artagnan.
NA
â€œThen proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you, since for the
NA
NA
â€œHave you, my dear Aramis, thought sometimes of those happy, happy,
happy days of youth we passed laughing, drinking, and fighting each

â€œCertainly, and more than once regretted them; it was indeed a glorious

â€œWell, those splendidly wild days may chance to come again; I am
commissioned to find out my companions and I began by you, who were the

Aramis bowed, rather with respect than pleasure at the compliment.
NA
in his easy-chair. â€œAh! dear Dâ€™Artagnan! see how regularly I live and
how easy I am here. We have experienced the ingratitude of â€˜the great,â€™
NA
NA
NA
â€œIn that case it would be quite another thing. Come! letâ€™s be merciful
to every sinner! Besides, you are right in another respect, which is in
thinking that if we were to meddle in politics there could not be a
NA
NA
â€œAh! without caring about them myself, I live among those who are much
occupied in them. Poet as I am, I am intimate with Sarazin, who is
devoted to the Prince de Conti, and with Monsieur de Bois-Robert, who,
since the death of Cardinal Richelieu, is of all parties or any party;
so that political discussions have not altogether been uninteresting to
NA
NA
â€œNow, my dear friend, look upon all I tell you as merely the statement
of a monk--of a man who resembles an echo--repeating simply what he
hears. I understand that Mazarin is at this very moment extremely uneasy
as to the state of affairs; that his orders are not respected like those
of our former bugbear, the deceased cardinal, whose portrait as you see
hangs yonder--for whatever may be thought of him, it must be allowed
NA
NA
â€œMy first impressions were favorable to the minister; I said to myself
that a minister is never loved, but that with the genius this one was
said to have he would eventually triumph over his enemies and would make
himself feared, which in my opinion is much more to be desired than to

Dâ€™Artagnan made a sign with his head which indicated that he entirely
approved that doubtful maxim.
NA
ignorant in matters of this kind and as the humility which I profess
obliges me not to rest on my own judgment, but to ask the opinion of
NA
Aramis paused.
NA
â€œWell, I must mortify myself. I must confess that I was mistaken.
Monsieur de Mazarin is not a man of genius, as I thought, he is a man of
no origin--once a servant of Cardinal Bentivoglio, and he got on by
intrigue. He is an upstart, a man of no name, who will only be the tool
of a party in France. He will amass wealth, he will injure the kingâ€™s
revenue and pay to himself the pensions which Richelieu paid to others.
He is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling, but a sort of
NA
NA
â€œAh! it fills me with pride to find that, thanks to a common sort of
penetration with which I am endowed, I am approved by a man like you,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œA child who will be of age in four years. Then he has neither the
parliament nor the people with him--they represent the wealth of the
country; nor the nobles nor the princes, who are the military power of
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan scratched his ear. He was forced to confess to himself that
this reasoning was not only comprehensive, but just.
â€œYou see, my poor friend, that I am sometimes bereft of my ordinary
thoughtfulness; perhaps I am wrong in speaking thus to you, who have
NA
NA
NA
â€œDid I? I was wrong then, no, I said what you say--there is a crisis at
hand. Well! letâ€™s fly the feather before the wind; let us join with that
side to which the wind will carry it and resume our adventurous life. We
were once four valiant knights--four hearts fondly united; let us unite
again, not our hearts, which have never been severed, but our courage
and our fortunes. Hereâ€™s a good opportunity for getting something better
NA
â€œYou are right, Dâ€™Artagnan; I held a similar project, but as I had not
nor ever shall have your fruitful, vigorous imagination, the idea was
suggested to me. Every one nowadays wants auxiliaries; propositions have
been made to me and I confess to you frankly that the coadjutor has made
NA
NA
NA
understand. Well, it is a question of serving the king, the gentlemanâ€™s
NA
NA
â€œHe is, but not willingly; in appearance, not heart; and that is exactly
NA
â€œAh! but this is, indeed, civil war which you propose to me, dear

than I do. Do you think she will ever forget that her son is her
safeguard, her shield, the pledge for her dignity, for her fortune and
her life? Should she forsake Mazarin she must join her son and go over
to the princesâ€™ side; but you know better than I do that there are
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
politics? I am not obliged to read any breviary. I have a jolly little
circle of witty abbes and pretty women; everything goes on smoothly, so
NA
NA
convinces me, on my honor. I donâ€™t know what devil of an insect stung me
and made me ambitious. I have a post by which I live; at the death of
Monsieur de Treville, who is old, I may be a captain, which is a very
snug berth for a once penniless Gascon. Instead of running after
adventures I shall accept an invitation from Porthos; I shall go and
NA
â€œI should think so, indeed. Ten leagues of wood, of marsh land and
valleys; he is lord of the hill and the plain and is now carrying on a

â€œTo which he adds that of Bracieux, an estate which has been a barony,
NA
NA
â€œI donâ€™t doubt it. The â€˜Baroness Porthosâ€™ will sound particularly

And the two friends began to laugh.
NA
NA
â€œNo, let us belong to no party, but remain friends; let us be neither
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAnd I shall be at the convent of Jesuits; from six in the morning to
eight at night come by the door. From eight in the evening until six in
NA
NA
NA
and cloak.
NA
Aramis whistled for Bazin, but Bazin was asleep in the ante-chamber, and
Aramis was obliged to shake him by the ear to awake him.
Bazin stretched his arms, rubbed his eyes, and tried to go to sleep
again.
NA
NA
NA
â€œThe other one, the gardenerâ€™s. Didnâ€™t you see that Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan was about to assure Aramis that he could descend easily, when
an idea came into his head which silenced him.
Bazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the ladder.
Presently a good, solid, wooden ladder was placed against the window.
NA
NA
Aramisâ€™s searching look seemed to seek his friendâ€™s thought even at the
bottom of his heart, but Dâ€™Artagnan sustained the inquisition with an
air of admirable simplicity. Besides, at that moment he put his foot on
the first step of the ladder and began his descent. In a moment he was
on the ground. Bazin remained at the window.
NA
The two friends went toward the shed. At their approach Planchet came
out leading the two horses.
NA
vigilant, not like that lazy fellow Bazin, who is no longer good for
anything since he became connected with the church. Follow us, Planchet;
NA
They traversed the width of the village, talking of indifferent things,
then as they reached the last houses:
NA
lavishes her smiles upon you; do not let her flee from your embrace. As
NA
NA
NA
NA
Aramis; â€œbut I repeat, I am made up of contradictions. What I hate
to-day I adore to-morrow, and vice versa. You see that I cannot, like
NA
NA
the contrary, knowest how to choose thy object and to gain it
NA
The friends embraced. They descended into the plain by the ladder.
Planchet met them hard by the shed. Dâ€™Artagnan jumped into the saddle,
then the old companions in arms again shook hands. Dâ€™Artagnan and
Planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to Paris.
But after he had gone about two hundred steps Dâ€™Artagnan stopped short,
alighted, threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of Planchet and
took the pistols from his saddle-bow to fasten them to his girdle.
NA
â€œThis is the matter: be he ever so cunning he shall never say I was his
dupe. Stand here, donâ€™t stir, turn your back to the road and wait for
NA
Having thus spoken, Dâ€™Artagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and
crossed the plain so as to wind around the village. He had observed
between the house that Madame de Longueville inhabited and the convent
of the Jesuits, an open space surrounded by a hedge.
The moon had now risen and he could see well enough to retrace his road.
He reached the hedge and hid himself behind it; in passing by the house
where the scene which we have related took place, he remarked that the
window was again lighted up and he was convinced that Aramis had not yet
returned to his own apartment and that when he did it would not be
alone.
In truth, in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low whispers.
Close to the hedge the steps stopped.
Dâ€™Artagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the hedge.
Two men, to the astonishment of Dâ€™Artagnan, appeared shortly; soon,
however, his surprise vanished, for he heard the murmurs of a soft,
harmonious voice; one of these two men was a woman disguised as a
cavalier.
NA
never happen again. I have discovered a sort of subterranean passage
which runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the
NA
NA
that of Aramis. â€œI swear to you, princess, that if your reputation did
NA
â€œYes, yes! I know you are as brave and venturesome as any man in the
world, but you do not belong to me alone; you belong to all our party.
NA
NA
He kissed her hand tenderly.
NA
NA
NA
Aramis rushed after the fugitive hat. Dâ€™Artagnan took advantage of the
circumstance to find a place in the hedge not so thick, where his glance
could penetrate to the supposed cavalier. At that instant, the moon,
inquisitive, perhaps, like Dâ€™Artagnan, came from behind a cloud and by
her light Dâ€™Artagnan recognized the large blue eyes, the golden hair and
the classic head of the Duchess de Longueville.
Aramis returned, laughing, one hat on his head and the other in his
hand; and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the convent.
NA
NA
10. Monsieur Porthos du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds.
Thanks to what Aramis had told him, Dâ€™Artagnan, who knew already that
Porthos called himself Du Vallon, was now aware that he styled himself,
from his estate, De Bracieux; and that he was, on account of this
estate, engaged in a lawsuit with the Bishop of Noyon. It was, then, in
the neighborhood of Noyon that he must seek that estate. His itinerary
was promptly determined: he would go to Dammartin, from which place two
roads diverge, one toward Soissons, the other toward Compiegne; there he
would inquire concerning the Bracieux estate and go to the right or to
the left according to the information obtained.
Planchet, who was still a little concerned for his safety after his
recent escapade, declared that he would follow Dâ€™Artagnan even to the
end of the world, either by the road to the right or by that to the
left; only he begged his former master to set out in the evening, for
greater security to himself. Dâ€™Artagnan suggested that he should send
word to his wife, so that she might not be anxious about him, but
Planchet replied with much sagacity that he was very sure his wife would
not die of anxiety through not knowing where he was, while he, Planchet,
remembering her incontinence of tongue, would die of anxiety if she did
know.
This reasoning seemed to Dâ€™Artagnan so satisfactory that he no further
insisted; and about eight oâ€™clock in the evening, the time when the
vapors of night begin to thicken in the streets, he left the Hotel de la
Chevrette, and followed by Planchet set forth from the capital by way of
the Saint Denis gate.
At midnight the two travelers were at Dammartin, but it was then too
late to make inquiries--the host of the Cygne de la Croix had gone to
bed.
The next morning Dâ€™Artagnan summoned the host, one of those sly Normans
who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a
direct answer. Dâ€™Artagnan, however, gathered from his equivocal replies
that the road to the right was the one he ought to take, and on that
uncertain information he resumed his journey. At nine in the morning he
reached Nanteuil and stopped for breakfast. His host here was a good
fellow from Picardy, who gave him all the information he needed. The
Bracieux estate was a few leagues from Villars-Cotterets.
Dâ€™Artagnan was acquainted with Villars-Cotterets, having gone thither
with the court on several occasions; for at that time Villars-Cotterets
was a royal residence. He therefore shaped his course toward that place
and dismounted at the Dauphin dâ€™Or. There he ascertained that the
Bracieux estate was four leagues distant, but that Porthos was not at
Bracieux. Porthos had, in fact, been involved in a dispute with the
Bishop of Noyon in regard to the Pierrefonds property, which adjoined
his own, and weary at length of a legal controversy which was beyond his
comprehension, he put an end to it by purchasing Pierrefonds and added
that name to his others. He now called himself Du Vallon de Bracieux de
Pierrefonds, and resided on his new estate.
The travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next
day; the horses had done ten leagues that day and needed rest. It is
true they might have taken others, but there was a great forest to pass
through and Planchet, as we have seen, had no liking for forests after
dark.
There was another thing that Planchet had no liking for and that was
starting on a journey with a hungry stomach. Accordingly, Dâ€™Artagnan, on
awaking, found his breakfast waiting for him. It need not be said that
Planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former
humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by
Dâ€™Artagnan.
It was nearly eight oâ€™clock when they set out again. Their course was
clearly defined: they were to follow the road toward Compiegne and on
emerging from the forest turn to the right.
The morning was beautiful, and in this early springtime the birds sang
on the trees and the sunbeams shone through the misty glades, like
curtains of golden gauze.
In other parts of the forest the light could scarcely penetrate through
the foliage, and the stems of two old oak trees, the refuge of the
squirrel, startled by the travelers, were in deep shadow.
There came up from all nature in the dawn of day a perfume of herbs,
flowers and leaves, which delighted the heart. Dâ€™Artagnan, sick of the
closeness of Paris, thought that when a man had three names of his
different estates joined one to another, he ought to be very happy in
such a paradise; then he shook his head, saying, â€œIf I were Porthos and
Dâ€™Artagnan came to make me such a proposition as I am going to make to
NA
As to Planchet, he thought of little or nothing, but was happy as a
hunting-hound in his old masterâ€™s company.
At the extremity of the wood Dâ€™Artagnan perceived the road that had been
described to him, and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an
immense feudal castle.
NA
of Orleans. Can Porthos have negotiated for it with the Duc de
NA
NA
NA
NA
call him De Bracieux or De Pierrefonds; thou wilt knell out damnation to
NA
As he approached the castle which had first attracted his eye,
Dâ€™Artagnan was convinced that it could not be there that his friend
dwelt; the towers, though solid and as if built yesterday, were open and
broken. One might have fancied that some giant had cleaved them with
blows from a hatchet.
On arriving at the extremity of the castle Dâ€™Artagnan found himself
overlooking a beautiful valley, in which, at the foot of a charming
little lake, stood several scattered houses, which, humble in their
aspect, and covered, some with tiles, others with thatch, seemed to
acknowledge as their sovereign lord a pretty chateau, built about the
beginning of the reign of Henry IV., and surmounted by four stately,
gilded weather-cocks. Dâ€™Artagnan no longer doubted that this was
Porthosâ€™s pleasant dwelling place.
The road led straight up to the chateau which, compared to its ancestor
on the hill, was exactly what a fop of the coterie of the Duc dâ€™Enghein
would have been beside a knight in steel armor in the time of Charles
VII. Dâ€™Artagnan spurred his horse on and pursued his road, followed by
Planchet at the same pace.
In ten minutes Dâ€™Artagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted
with fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate, the points and
crossed bars of which were gilt. In the midst of this avenue was a
nobleman, dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the
iron gate, riding on a tall horse. On his right hand and his left were
two footmen, with the seams of their dresses laced. A considerable
number of clowns were assembled and rendered homage to their lord.
NA
Bracieux de Pierrefonds? Well-a-day! how he has shrunk since he gave up

NA

NA
NA
NA
As he spoke, he rode toward the tall horse--to the man of importance and
his valets. As he approached he seemed to recognize the features of this
individual.
NA
At this exclamation the man on horseback turned slowly and with a lofty
air, and the two travelers could see, displayed in all their brilliancy,
the large eyes, the vermilion visage, and the eloquent smile
of--Mousqueton.
It was indeed Mousqueton--Mousqueton, as fat as a pig, rolling about
with rude health, puffed out with good living, who, recognizing
Dâ€™Artagnan and acting very differently from the hypocrite Bazin, slipped
off his horse and approached the officer with his hat off, so that the
homage of the assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun, which
eclipsed the former luminary.
NA
cheeks swelling out and his whole frame perspiring with joy; â€œMonsieur
dâ€™Artagnan! oh! what joy for my lord and master, Du Vallon de Bracieux
NA
NA
NA
â€œBut how handsome thou art--how fat! thou hast prospered and grown

NA
NA
NA
with open arms and eyes full of tears.
NA
NA
â€œProud toward an old friend? never, Planchet! thou wouldst not have

NA
to Mousqueton, the two servants embraced with an emotion which touched
those who were present and made them suppose that Planchet was a great
lord in disguise, so highly did they estimate the position of
Mousqueton.
NA
who had in vain tried to clasp his hands behind his friendâ€™s fat back,
â€œnow, sir, allow me to leave you, for I could not permit my master to
hear of your arrival from any but myself; he would never forgive me for

NA
the former name borne by Porthos or his new one, â€œthen he has not

On Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s lips there played one of those rare and melancholy
smiles which seemed to emanate from the depth of his soul--the last
trace of youth and happiness that had survived lifeâ€™s disillusions.
NA

And mounting his horse Mousqueton rode off down the avenue on the grass
at a hand gallop.
NA
mysteries, no cloak to hide oneâ€™s self in, no cunning policy here;
people laugh outright, they weep for joy here. I see nothing but faces a
yard broad; in short, it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday
garb, and that the trees, instead of leaves and flowers, are covered
NA
NA
most delectable perfume of fine roast meat, and to see the scullions in
a row by the hedge, hailing our approach. Ah! sir, what a cook must
Monsieur Pierrefonds have, when he was so fond of eating and drinking,

NA
appearances I am lost; for a man so well off will never change his happy
condition, and I shall fail with him, as I have already done with
NA
11. Wealth does not necessarily produce Happiness.
Dâ€™Artagnan passed through the iron gate and arrived in front of the
chateau. He alighted as he saw a species of giant on the steps. Let us
do justice to Dâ€™Artagnan. Independently of every selfish wish, his heart
palpitated with joy when he saw that tall form and martial demeanor,
which recalled to him a good and brave man.
He ran to Porthos and threw himself into his arms; the whole body of
servants, arranged in a semi-circle at a respectful distance, looked on
with humble curiosity. Mousqueton, at the head of them, wiped his eyes.
Porthos linked his arm in that of his friend.

which was now changed from a baritone into a bass, â€œyouâ€™ve not then

And he heaved a sigh.

you will help me to recover my spirits; to-morrow we will hunt the hare

woods, which are magnificent. I have four harriers which are considered
the swiftest in the county, and a pack of hounds which are unequalled

And Porthos heaved another sigh.
NA
NA
A third sigh from Porthos.

in affliction on that account. That was the reason why I left my Chateau
du Vallon near Corbeil, and came to my estate, Bracieux. Poor Madame du
Vallon! her temper was uncertain, but she came at last to accustom

They went into the chateau; there was nothing but gilding, high and low;
the cornices were gilt, the mouldings were gilt, the legs and arms of
the chairs were gilt. A table, ready set out, awaited them.

Porthos sighed for the fifth time--Dâ€™Artagnan had counted his sighs. He
became curious to solve the problem.

Porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine.
â€œNo; but just think, there are paltry country squires who have all some

Porthos, in pronouncing these words, seemed to gulp down something.
â€œMadame du Vallon was of doubtful gentility. She had, in her first
marriage--I donâ€™t think, Dâ€™Artagnan, I am telling you anything
new--married a lawyer; they thought that â€˜nauseous;â€™ you can understand
thatâ€™s a word bad enough to make one kill thirty thousand men. I have
killed two, which has made people hold their tongues, but has not made
me their friend. So that I have no society; I live alone; I am sick of

Dâ€™Artagnan smiled. He now saw where the breastplate was weak, and
prepared the blow.
NA
NA
â€œYes, but understand me; not being of a race of historic fame, like the
De Courcys, who were content to be plain sirs, or the Rohans, who didnâ€™t

NA
â€œWell, my friend, I am come to give you this very title which you wish

Porthos gave a start that shook the room; two or three bottles fell and
were broken. Mousqueton ran thither, hearing the noise.
Porthos waved his hand to Mousqueton to pick up the bottles.

NA

and I sit on one of those marble seats, have my gun brought to me, my

Dâ€™Artagnan now no longer counted the sighs. They were innumerable.

â€œGo into harness again, gird on your sword, run after adventures, and
NA
NA
â€œI see you are spoiled, dear friend; you are corpulent, your arm has no

NA

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThat is to say, you are for us. Well, I tell you that I come to you

This speech was heard by Porthos in the same sense as if it had still
been in the year 1640 and related to the true cardinal.

road so much; you gave him three sword-wounds in three separate

â€œWell, my dear friend, win it--it is at the point of your sword. We
shall not interfere with each other--your object is a title; mine,

thirty acres of land about it, that is all I wish. I shall retire and

the fields and on the property of my neighbours, in order to pick up a
nice little quarrel, which I am really in want of, but nothing happens.

me trample down the clover with my dogs, insult and obstruct every one,
and I come back still more weary and low-spirited, thatâ€™s all. At any

â€œIn that respect, my dear friend, itâ€™s delightful. No more edicts, no
more of the cardinalâ€™s guards, no more De Jussacs, nor other
bloodhounds. Iâ€™Gad! underneath a lamp in an inn, anywhere, they ask â€˜Are

Duke de Guise killed Monsieur de Coligny in the Place Royale and nothing

NA

On this promise being given, Porthos, who had never doubted his friendâ€™s
assurance, turned back with him toward the castle.
12. Porthos was Discontented with his Condition.
As they returned toward the castle, Dâ€™Artagnan thought of the miseries
of poor human nature, always dissatisfied with what it has, ever
desirous of what it has not.
In the position of Porthos, Dâ€™Artagnan would have been perfectly happy;
and to make Porthos contented there was wanting--what? five letters to
put before his three names, a tiny coronet to paint upon the panels of
his carriage!
NA
NA
Whilst making this reflection, chance seemed, as it were, to give him
the lie direct. When Porthos had left him to give some orders he saw
Mousqueton approaching. The face of the steward, despite one slight
shade of care, light as a summer cloud, seemed a physiognomy of absolute
felicity.
NA
NA
He then made a sign for Mousqueton to come to him.
NA
NA
â€œI am afraid to do so. Perhaps you will think, sir, that prosperity has
NA
NA
â€œAs happy as possible; and yet, sir, you may make me even happier than I
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œSir, the favor I have to ask of you is, not to call me â€˜Mousquetonâ€™ but
â€˜Mouston.â€™ Since I have had the honor of being my lordâ€™s steward I have
taken the last name as more dignified and calculated to make my
inferiors respect me. You, sir, know how necessary subordination is in
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan smiled; Porthos wanted to lengthen out his names, Mousqueton
to cut his short.
NA
Mouston; and if it makes thee happy I will not â€˜tutoyerâ€™ you any
NA
NA
NA
NA
tribulations I am bringing to this poor devil who has so warmly welcomed
NA
NA
glowing countenance.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan was secretly touched with remorse, not at inducing Porthos to
enter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in jeopardy,
for Porthos, in the title of baron, had his object and reward; but poor
Mousqueton, whose only wish was to be called Mouston--was it not cruel
to snatch him from the delightful state of peace and plenty in which he
was?
He was thinking of these matters when Porthos summoned him to dinner.
NA
NA
â€œYour home is a paradise, Porthos; one takes no note of time. I follow
NA
â€œCome, if one canâ€™t always eat, one can always drink--a maxim of poor
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan, who as a Gascon, was inclined to sobriety, seemed not so
sure as his friend of the truth of Athosâ€™s maxim, but he did his best to
keep up with his host. Meanwhile his misgivings in regard to Mousqueton
recurred to his mind and with greater force because Mousqueton, though
he did not himself wait on the table, which would have been beneath him
in his new position, appeared at the door from time to time and evinced
his gratitude to Dâ€™Artagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to be
served. Therefore, when, at dessert, upon a sign from Dâ€™Artagnan,
Porthos had sent away his servants and the two friends were alone:
NA
NA
This was a blow to Dâ€™Artagnan. He could already see the intendantâ€™s

At that moment the steward came in to consult his master upon the
proceedings of the next day and also with regard to the shooting party
which had been proposed.

fat, smooth cheeks shook as he spoke, and he looked at Dâ€™Artagnan with
an air of reproach; he staggered, and his voice was almost choked.
â€œYes and no. We shall serve in a campaign, seek out all sorts of

These last words fell on Mousqueton like a thunderbolt. It was those
very terrible old days that made the present so excessively delightful,
and the blow was so great he rushed out, overcome, and forgot to shut
the door.
The two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build
castles in the air. The good wine which Mousqueton had placed before
them traced out in glowing drops to Dâ€™Artagnan a fine perspective,
shining with quadruples and pistoles, and showed to Porthos a blue
ribbon and a ducal mantle; they were, in fact, asleep on the table when
the servants came to light them to their bed.
Mousqueton was, however, somewhat consoled by Dâ€™Artagnan, who the next
day told him that in all probability war would always be carried on in
the heart of Paris and within reach of the Chateau du Vallon, which was
near Corbeil, or Bracieux, which was near Melun, and of Pierrefonds,
which was between Compiegne and Villars-Cotterets.
NA
NA
NA
Mousqueton inquired, therefore, the state of the case of his old friend,
NA
NA
NA
NA
Porthos, meantime, asked Dâ€™Artagnan to give him his instructions how to
proceed on his journey.
NA
to rest there; three or four days to return to Paris. Set out,
therefore, in a week, with your suite, and go to the Hotel de la

NA
â€œAs to myself, I shall go around to see Athos; for though I donâ€™t think
his aid worth much, one must with oneâ€™s friends observe all due

The friends then took leave of each other on the very border of the
estate of Pierrefonds, to which Porthos escorted his friend.
NA

That devil, Porthos, is a man of prodigious strength; still, if Athos
joins us, well, we shall be three of us to laugh at Aramis, that little

At Villars-Cotterets he wrote to the cardinal:
â€œMy Lord,--I have already one man to offer to your eminence, and he is
well worth twenty men. I am just setting out for Blois. The Comte de la
NA
13. Two Angelic Faces.
The road was long, but the horses upon which Dâ€™Artagnan and Planchet
rode had been refreshed in the well supplied stables of the Lord of
Bracieux; the master and servant rode side by side, conversing as they
went, for Dâ€™Artagnan had by degrees thrown off the master and Planchet
had entirely ceased to assume the manners of a servant. He had been
raised by circumstances to the rank of a confidant to his master. It was
many years since Dâ€™Artagnan had opened his heart to any one; it
happened, however, that these two men, on meeting again, assimilated
perfectly. Planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new
adventures; he was a man of uncommonly sound sense. Without courting
danger he never shrank from an encounter; in short, he had been a
soldier and arms ennoble a man; it was, therefore, on the footing of
friends that Dâ€™Artagnan and Planchet arrived in the neighborhood of
Blois.
Going along, Dâ€™Artagnan, shaking his head, said:
â€œI know that my going to Athos is useless and absurd; but still I owe
this courtesy to my old friend, a man who had in him material for the
NA
NA
Scattering money round about him as Heaven sprinkles rain. Do you
remember, sir, that duel with the Englishman in the inclosure des
Carmes? Ah! how lofty, how magnificent Monsieur Athos was that day, when
he said to his adversary: â€˜You have insisted on knowing my name, sir; so
much the worse for you, since I shall be obliged to kill you.â€™ I was
near him, those were his exact words, when he stabbed his foe as he said
he would, and his adversary fell without saying, â€˜Oh!â€™ â€˜Tis a noble

his lips, to hear him say, â€˜Come, juice of the grape, and chase away my

This noble gentleman with his lofty glance, this handsome cavalier, so
brilliant in feats of arms that every one was surprised that he held in
his hand a sword only instead of a baton of command! Alas! we shall find
him changed into a broken down old man, with garnet nose and eyes that
slobber; we shall find him extended on some lawn, whence he will look at
us with a languid eye and peradventure will not recognize us. God knows,
Planchet, that I should fly from a sight so sad if I did not wish to
show my respect for the illustrious shadow of what was once the Comte de

Planchet shook his head and said nothing. It was evident that he shared
his masterâ€™s apprehensions.

At this moment one of those heavy wagons, drawn by bullocks, which carry
the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the
Loire, came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the
two horsemen were following. A man carrying a long switch with a nail at
the end of it, with which he urged on his slow team, was walking with
the cart.
NA
NA
accent peculiar to the people of that district and which might have put
to shame the cultured denizens of the Sorbonne and the Rue de
lâ€™Universite.
NA
The peasant took off his hat on hearing this revered name.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan determined not to question this man; he did not wish to hear
from another what he had himself said to Planchet.
NA
Athos is not a man to be thwarted; he, like Porthos, has obliged his
peasantry to call him â€˜my lord,â€™ and to dignify his pettifogging place
by the name of chateau. He had a heavy hand--dear old Athos--after
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan, after asking the man the right way, continued his route,
agitated in spite of himself at the idea of seeing once more that
singular man whom he had so truly loved and who had contributed so much
by advice and example to his education as a gentleman. He checked by
degrees the speed of his horse and went on, his head drooping as if in
deep thought.
Soon, as the road turned, the Chateau de la Valliere appeared in view;
then, a quarter of a mile beyond, a white house, encircled in sycamores,
was visible at the farther end of a group of trees, which spring had
powdered with a snow of flowers.
On beholding this house, Dâ€™Artagnan, calm as he was in general, felt an
unusual disturbance within his heart--so powerful during the whole
course of life are the recollections of youth. He proceeded,
nevertheless, and came opposite to an iron gate, ornamented in the taste
of the period.
Through the gate was seen kitchen-gardens, carefully attended to, a
spacious courtyard, in which neighed several horses held by valets in
various liveries, and a carriage, drawn by two horses of the country.
NA
Athos. Good heavens! suppose he is dead and that this property now
belongs to some one who bears his name. Alight, Planchet, and inquire,

Planchet, leading his horse by the bridle, drew near to the gate and
rang the bell, and immediately a servant-man with white hair and of
erect stature, notwithstanding his age, presented himself.
NA
NA
who was not in livery.
NA
NA
NA
prudently considered that he couldnâ€™t have too much information.
NA
the servitor, who, little used as he was to such inquiries, began to
examine Planchet from head to foot.
NA
de la Fere whom we seek. Be good enough to open to me, for I wish to
announce to monsieur le comte that my master, one of his friends, is
NA
NA
NA
NA
The servitor opened the gate and walked before Planchet, who made a sign
to Dâ€™Artagnan. The latter, his heart palpitating more than ever, entered
the courtyard without dismounting.
Whilst Planchet was standing on the steps before the house he heard a
voice say:
NA
This voice, the sound of which reached Dâ€™Artagnan, reawakened in his
heart a thousand sentiments, a thousand recollections that he had
forgotten. He vaulted hastily from his horse, whilst Planchet, with a
smile on his lips, advanced toward the master of the house.
NA
â€œOh, yes, monsieur le comte, you know me and I know you. I am

say no more, so much was he overcome by this unexpected interview.
NA
NA
voice and almost staggering from agitation.
At these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beautiful
countenance and calm features of Athos. He rushed toward Dâ€™Artagnan with
eyes fixed upon him and clasped him in his arms. Dâ€™Artagnan, equally
moved, pressed him also closely to him, whilst tears stood in his eyes.
Athos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawing-room, where
there were several people. Every one arose.
NA
lieutenant of his majestyâ€™s musketeers, a devoted friend and one of the
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own
way, and whilst the conversation became general he looked earnestly at
Athos.
Strange! Athos was scarcely aged at all! His fine eyes, no longer
surrounded by that dark line which nights of dissipation pencil too
infallibly, seemed larger, more liquid than ever. His face, a little
elongated, had gained in calm dignity what it had lost in feverish
excitement. His hand, always wonderfully beautiful and strong, was set
off by a ruffle of lace, like certain hands by Titian and Vandyck. He
was less stiff than formerly. His long, dark hair, softly powdered here
and there with silver tendrils, fell elegantly over his shoulders in
wavy curls; his voice was still youthful, as if belonging to a Hercules
of twenty-five, and his magnificent teeth, which he had preserved white
and sound, gave an indescribable charm to his smile.
Meanwhile the guests, seeing that the two friends were longing to be
alone, prepared to depart, when a noise of dogs barking resounded
through the courtyard and many persons said at the same moment:
NA
Athos, as the name of Raoul was pronounced, looked inquisitively at
Dâ€™Artagnan, in order to see if any curiosity was painted on his face.
But Dâ€™Artagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost
mechanically when a fine young man of fifteen years of age, dressed
simply, but in perfect taste, entered the room, raising, as he came, his
hat, adorned with a long plume of scarlet feathers.
Nevertheless, Dâ€™Artagnan was struck by the appearance of this new
personage. It seemed to explain to him the change in Athos; a
resemblance between the boy and the man explained the mystery of this
regenerated existence. He remained listening and gazing.

The youth looked pleased. He again took in his strong arms the little
girl, whose pretty golden head and smiling face rested on his shoulder,
and placed her gently in the carriage; then jumping on his horse with
the elegance of a first-rate esquire, after bowing to Athos and
Dâ€™Artagnan, he went off close by the door of the carriage, on somebody
inside of which his eyes were riveted.
14. The Castle of Bragelonne.
Whilst this scene was going on, Dâ€™Artagnan remained with open mouth and
a confused gaze. Everything had turned out so differently from what he
expected that he was stupefied with wonder.
Athos, who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts, took his
arm and led him into the garden.
NA
NA
NA
Athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over him.
Athos smiled.
â€œFirst and foremost, dear Dâ€™Artagnan, we have no title such as count
here. When I call you â€˜chevalier,â€™ it is in presenting you to my guests,
that they may know who you are. But to you, Dâ€™Artagnan, I am, I hope,
still dear Athos, your comrade, your friend. Do you intend to stand on

and a common. I have two horses,--I do not count my servantâ€™s bobtailed
nag. My sporting dogs consist of two pointers, two harriers and two

laughing.

â€œYou guess aright, my friend; this youth is an orphan, deserted by his
mother, who left him in the house of a poor country priest. I have
brought him up. It is Raoul who has worked in me the change you see; I
was dried up like a miserable tree, isolated, attached to nothing on
earth; it was only a deep affection that could make me take root again
and drag me back to life. This child has caused me to recover what I had
lost. I had no longer any wish to live for myself, I have lived for him.
I have corrected the vices that I had; I have assumed the virtues that I
had not. Precept something, but example more. I may be mistaken, but I
believe that Raoul will be as accomplished a gentleman as our degenerate

The remembrance of Milady recurred to Dâ€™Artagnan.

recalled the good old days, â€œthat we could form an association of men

conversation.

NA
NA
At this instant they heard the sound of horsesâ€™ feet.
NA
NA
In fact, the young man appeared at the gate, covered with dust, entered
the courtyard, leaped from his horse, which he consigned to the charge
of a groom, and then went to greet the count and Dâ€™Artagnan.
NA
â€œmonsieur is the Chevalier Dâ€™Artagnan of whom you have often heard me
NA
NA
â€œmonsieur le comte has pronounced your name before me as an example
NA
That little compliment could not fail to move Dâ€™Artagnan. He extended a
hand to Raoul and said:
â€œMy young friend, all the praises that are given me should be passed on
to the count here; for he has educated me in everything and it is not
his fault that his pupil profited so little from his instructions. But
he will make it up in you I am sure. I like your manner, Raoul, and your

Athos was more delighted than can be told. He looked at Dâ€™Artagnan with
an expression of gratitude and then bestowed on Raoul one of those
strange smiles, of which children are so proud when they receive them.
NA
NA
NA
â€œThey donâ€™t yet know, sir, on account of the swelling; but the doctor is
NA
At this moment a little boy, half peasant, half foot-boy, came to
announce supper.
Athos led his guest into a dining-room of moderate size, the windows of
which opened on one side on a garden, on the other on a hot-house full
of magnificent flowers.
Dâ€™Artagnan glanced at the dinner service. The plate was magnificent,
old, and appertaining to the family. Dâ€™Artagnan stopped to look at a
sideboard on which was a superb ewer of silver.
NA
â€œYes, a chef dâ€™oeuvre of the great Florentine sculptor, Benvenuto
NA
NA
â€œThat of Marignan, just at the point where one of my forefathers is
offering his sword to Francis I., who has broken his. It was on that
occasion that my ancestor, Enguerrand de la Fere, was made a knight of
the Order of St. Michael; besides which, the king, fifteen years
afterward, gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen
formerly in my house, also a lovely specimen of workmanship. Men were
NA
NA
who waited.
â€œMy good Charles, I particularly recommend to your care Planchet, the
laquais of Monsieur Dâ€™Artagnan. He likes good wine; now you have the key
of the cellar. He has slept a long time on a hard bed, so he wonâ€™t

Raoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to be quite
sure that it was he whom the lieutenant thus addressed.

performed some feats of arms at the siege of La Rochelle, under the
deceased cardinal and Monsieur de Bassompierre. My friend is still so
kind as to address me by that old and well beloved appellation, which

arms belonging to days of chivalry, so gloriously recounted by Tasso and

a wrist of steel, a sure eye and a glance of fire; thatâ€™s what his
adversary met with. He was eighteen, only three years older than you

man, with glistening eye.
NA
look of inquiry directed to Athos; â€œanother I disarmed or wounded, I

NA
The young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into
the night, but Athos pointed out to him that his guest must need repose.
Dâ€™Artagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued, but Athos
insisted on his retiring to his chamber, conducted thither by Raoul.
15. Athos as a Diplomatist.
Dâ€™Artagnan retired to bed--not to sleep, but to think over all he had
heard that evening. Being naturally goodhearted, and having had once a
liking for Athos, which had grown into a sincere friendship, he was
delighted at thus meeting a man full of intelligence and moral strength,
instead of a drunkard. He admitted without annoyance the continued
superiority of Athos over himself, devoid as he was of that jealousy
which might have saddened a less generous disposition; he was delighted
also that the high qualities of Athos appeared to promise favorably for
his mission. Nevertheless, it seemed to him that Athos was not in all
respects sincere and frank. Who was the youth he had adopted and who
bore so striking a resemblance to him? What could explain Athosâ€™s having
re-entered the world and the extreme sobriety he had observed at table?
The absence of Grimaud, whose name had never once been uttered by Athos,
gave Dâ€™Artagnan uneasiness. It was evident either that he no longer
possessed the confidence of his friend, or that Athos was bound by some
invisible chain, or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenantâ€™s
visit.
He could not help thinking of M. Rochefort, whom he had seen in Notre
Dame; could De Rochefort have forestalled him with Athos? Again, the
moderate fortune which Athos possessed, concealed as it was, so
skillfully, seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a
latent ambition which might be easily aroused. The clear and vigorous
intellect of Athos would render him more open to conviction than a less
able man would be. He would enter into the ministerâ€™s schemes with the
more ardor, because his natural activity would be doubled by necessity.
Resolved to seek an explanation on all these points on the following
day, Dâ€™Artagnan, in spite of his fatigue, prepared for an attack and
determined that it should take place after breakfast. He determined to
cultivate the good-will of the youth Raoul and, either whilst fencing
with him or when out shooting, to extract from his simplicity some
information which would connect the Athos of old times with the Athos of
the present. But Dâ€™Artagnan at the same time, being a man of extreme
caution, was quite aware what injury he should do himself, if by any
indiscretion or awkwardness he should betray has manoeuvering to the
experienced eye of Athos. Besides, to tell truth, whilst Dâ€™Artagnan was
quite disposed to adopt a subtle course against the cunning of Aramis or
the vanity of Porthos, he was ashamed to equivocate with Athos,
true-hearted, open Athos. It seemed to him that if Porthos and Aramis
deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy, they would like
him all the better for it; but that Athos, on the contrary, would
despise him.
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan, â€œthere are so many things his silence would have told me;
NA
There reigned a perfect stillness in the house. Dâ€™Artagnan had heard the
door shut and the shutters barred; the dogs became in their turn silent.
At last a nightingale, lost in a thicket of shrubs, in the midst of its
most melodious cadences had fluted low and lower into stillness and
fallen asleep. Not a sound was heard in the castle, except of a footstep
up and down, in the chamber above--as he supposed, the bedroom of Athos.
NA
NA
At length Athos went to bed, apparently, for the noise ceased.
Silence and fatigue together overcame Dâ€™Artagnan and sleep overtook him
also. He was not, however, a good sleeper. Scarcely had dawn gilded his
window curtains when he sprang out of bed and opened the windows.
Somebody, he perceived, was in the courtyard, moving stealthily. True to
his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power
to know, Dâ€™Artagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red
coat and brown hair of Raoul.
The young man was opening the door of the stable. He then, with
noiseless haste, took out the horse that he had ridden on the previous
evening, saddled and bridled it himself and led the animal into the
alley to the right of the kitchen-garden, opened a side door which
conducted him to a bridle road, shut it after him, and Dâ€™Artagnan saw
him pass by like a dart, bending, as he went, beneath the pendent
flowery branches of maple and acacia. The road, as Dâ€™Artagnan had
observed, was the way to Blois.
NA
affair, who doesnâ€™t at all agree with Athos in his hatred to the fair
sex. Heâ€™s not going to hunt, for he has neither dogs nor arms; heâ€™s not
going on a message, for he goes secretly. Why does he go in secret? Is
he afraid of me or of his father? for I am sure the count is his father.
By Jove! I shall know about that soon, for I shall soon speak out to
NA
Day was now advanced; all the noises that had ceased the night before
reawakened, one after the other. The bird on the branch, the dog in his
kennel, the sheep in the field, the boats moored in the Loire, even,
became alive and vocal. The latter, leaving the shore, abandoned
themselves gaily to the current. The Gascon gave a last twirl to his
mustache, a last turn to his hair, brushed, from habit, the brim of his
hat with the sleeve of his doublet, and went downstairs. Scarcely had he
descended the last step of the threshold when he saw Athos bent down
toward the ground, as if he were looking for a crown-piece in the dust.
NA
NA
â€œExcellently, Athos, but what are you looking for? You are perhaps a

â€œMy dear friend, if I am, you must not laugh at me for being so. In the
country people alter; one gets to like, without knowing it, all those
beautiful objects that God causes to spring from the earth, which are
despised in cities. I was looking anxiously for some iris roots I
planted here, close to this reservoir, and which some one has trampled
upon this morning. These gardeners are the most careless people in the
world; in bringing the horse out to the water theyâ€™ve allowed him to

Dâ€™Artagnan began to smile.
NA
And he took his friend along the alley, where a number of tracks like
those which had trampled down the flowerbeds, were visible.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
related what he had seen, watching Athos all the while.
NA
NA
â€œAh, to inquire after the little La Valliere; she has sprained her foot,

NA
NA
NA
â€œDear friend, at Raoulâ€™s age the heart is so expansive that it must
encircle one object or another, fancied or real. Well, his love is half
real, half fanciful. She is the prettiest little creature in the world,

NA
â€œNothing--I laugh at Raoul; but this first desire of the heart is
imperious. I remember, just at his age, how deep in love I was with a
Grecian statue which our good king, then Henry IV., gave my father,

day fall in love with in right earnest if he remains here. The parents
of little La Valliere have for a long time perceived and been amused at

â€œAnd must have a definite answer. Listen, Dâ€™Artagnan. There is but one
person, or rather, one cause, to whom a man like me can be useful--that

NA
â€œCome, Dâ€™Artagnan, donâ€™t let us play a sidelong game; your hesitation,

â€œYou know that I am not alluding to you; you are the pearl of brave,

wants to send the princes of the blood to prison, not daring to kill
them, as our great cardinal--our cardinal did--of the miser, who weighs
his gold pieces and keeps the clipped ones for fear, though he is rich,
of losing them at play next morning--of the impudent fellow who insults
the queen, as they say--so much the worse for her--and who is going in
three months to make war upon us, in order that he may retain his
pensions; is that the master whom you propose to me? I thank you,

golden mediocrity. Porthos has, perhaps, sixty thousand francs income.

quarreled formerly over the musketeer; but I--what have I in the world?
I have worn my cuirass these twenty years, kept down in this inferior
rank, without going forward or backward, hardly half living. In fact, I
am dead. Well! when there is some idea of being resuscitated, you say

Athos was for a few moments thoughtful.
NA
From that moment he grew very guarded.
On his side Dâ€™Artagnan became more cautious also.

NA
â€œDoubtless he has. But such is man, we always want something more than

The conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Raoul.

â€œAnd what makes me all the more wretched, sir, is, that I was the cause

NA
NA
â€œThereâ€™s only one remedy, dear Raoul--that is, to marry her as a

NA
NA
The good understanding between the two friends was not in the least
altered by the morningâ€™s skirmish. They breakfasted with a good
appetite, looking now and then at poor Raoul, who with moist eyes and a
full heart, scarcely ate at all.
After breakfast two letters arrived for Athos, who read them with
profound attention, whilst Dâ€™Artagnan could not restrain himself from
jumping up several times on seeing him read these epistles, in one of
which, there being at the time a very strong light, he perceived the
fine writing of Aramis. The other was in a feminine hand, long, and
crossed.
NA
NA
And they both went into a low room where there were foils, gloves,
masks, breastplates, and all the accessories for a fencing match.
In a quarter of an hour Athos joined them and at the same moment Charles
brought in a letter for Dâ€™Artagnan, which a messenger had just desired
might be instantly delivered.
It was now Athosâ€™s turn to take a sly look.
Dâ€™Artagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said, shaking his
head:
â€œSee, dear friend, what it is to belong to the army. Faith, you are
indeed right not to return to it. Monsieur de Treville is ill, so my

Then turning to Athos he added:
â€œI seem to miss something here. I am really sorry to go away without

The friends embraced cordially; Dâ€™Artagnan pressed Raoulâ€™s hand.

Raoul turned toward Athos, who showed him by a secret sign that he did
not wish him to go.

Athos waved his hand, Raoul bowed, and Dâ€™Artagnan and Planchet set out.
The count followed them with his eyes, his hands resting on the
shoulders of the youth, whose height was almost equal to his own; but as
soon as they were out of sight he said:
NA
NA
â€œYou may go and offer your adieux and mine to Madame de Saint-Remy. I

The young man bent low, with an expression of sorrow and gratitude
mingled, and retired in order to saddle his horse.
As to Dâ€™Artagnan, scarcely, on his side, was he out of sight when he
drew from his pocket a letter, which he read over again:
NA
NA
postscript, probably I should not have understood it; but happily there

And he read that welcome postscript, which made him forget the
abruptness of the letter.

And they set out at as hard a canter as their horses could maintain.
16. The Duc de Beaufort.
The circumstances that had hastened the return of Dâ€™Artagnan to Paris
were as follows:
One evening, when Mazarin, according to custom, went to visit the queen,
in passing the guard-chamber he heard loud voices; wishing to know on
what topic the soldiers were conversing, he approached with his wonted
wolf-like step, pushed open the door and put his head close to the
chink.
There was a dispute among the guards.
NA
â€˜tis as good as true; I know nothing about it, but I have heard say that
NA
â€œDeuce take it, friend, if heâ€™s one of thy friends thou wilt ruin him in

NA
NA
NA
â€œNo? â€˜Tis not a long time since the late cardinal burnt Urban Grandier,
NA
â€œMy friend, Urban Grandier wasnâ€™t a sorcerer, he was a learned man. He
didnâ€™t predict the future, he knew the past--often a more dangerous

Mazarin nodded an assent, but wishing to know what this prediction was,
about which they disputed, he remained in the same place.
NA
say that if his prophecy gets wind, itâ€™s a sure way to prevent itâ€™s

NA
â€œWhy, in this way: if Coysel says loud enough for the cardinal to hear
him, on such or such a day such a prisoner will escape, â€˜tis plain that
the cardinal will take measures of precaution and that the prisoner will

NA
bench, but who had lost not a syllable of the conversation, â€œdo you
suppose that men can escape their destiny? If it is written yonder, in
Heaven, that the Duc de Beaufort is to escape, he will escape; and all

Mazarin started. He was an Italian and therefore superstitious. He
walked straight into the midst of the guards, who on seeing him were
silent.

originator of the tale.
NA
from a man named Coysel, who believes that, be he ever so closely
watched and guarded, the Duke of Beaufort will escape before

NA
NA
many things which have come to pass; for instance, that the queen would
have a son; that Monsieur Coligny would be killed in a duel with the Duc
de Guise; and finally, that the coadjutor would be made cardinal. Well!
the queen has not only one son, but two; then, Monsieur de Coligny was

NA
NA
Mazarin made a grimace, as if he meant to say, â€œBut he does not wear the

â€œSo, my friend, itâ€™s your opinion that Monsieur de Beaufort will
NA
â€œThatâ€™s my idea, my lord; and if your eminence were to offer to make me
at this moment governor of the castle of Vincennes, I should refuse it.
NA
There is nothing so convincing as a firm conviction. It has its own
effect upon the most incredulous; and far from being incredulous,
Mazarin was superstitious. He went away thoughtful and anxious and
returned to his own room, where he summoned Bernouin and desired him to
fetch thither in the morning the special guard he had placed over
Monsieur de Beaufort and to awaken him whenever he should arrive.
The guard had, in fact, touched the cardinal in the tenderest point.
During the whole five years in which the Duc de Beaufort had been in
prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret
dread of his escape. It was not possible, as he knew well, to confine
for the whole of his life the grandson of Henry IV., especially when
this young prince was scarcely thirty years of age. But however and
whensoever he did escape, what hatred he must cherish against him to
whom he owed his long imprisonment; who had taken him, rich, brave,
glorious, beloved by women, feared by men, to cut off his lifeâ€™s best,
happiest years; for it is not life, it is merely existence, in prison!
Meantime, Mazarin redoubled his surveillance over the duke. But like the
miser in the fable, he could not sleep for thinking of his treasure.
Often he awoke in the night, suddenly, dreaming that he had been robbed
of Monsieur de Beaufort. Then he inquired about him and had the vexation
of hearing that the prisoner played, drank, sang, but that whilst
playing, drinking, singing, he often stopped short to vow that Mazarin
should pay dear for all the amusements he had forced him to enter into
at Vincennes.
So much did this one idea haunt the cardinal even in his sleep, that
when at seven in the morning Bernouin came to arouse him, his first
words were: â€œWell, whatâ€™s the matter? Has Monsieur de Beaufort escaped
NA
NA
NA
NA
might receive the visitor sitting up in bed.
The officer entered, a large fat man, with an open physiognomy. His air
of perfect serenity made Mazarin uneasy.
NA
The officer obeyed.
NA
NA
â€œWell, they say that Monsieur de Beaufort is going to escape from
NA
The officerâ€™s face expressed complete stupefaction. He opened at once
his little eyes and his great mouth, to inhale better the joke his
eminence deigned to address to him, and ended by a burst of laughter, so
violent that his great limbs shook in hilarity as they would have done
in an ague.
â€œEscape! my lord--escape! Your eminence does not then know where
NA
NA
â€œYes, sir; in a room, the walls of which are seven feet thick, with
NA
NA
NA
â€œThen my lord does not know that there are eight guards about him, four

NA
â€œSir, those amusements are allowed; but if your eminence wishes it, we

retrenched his amusement. He then asked with whom he played.
â€œMy lord, either with the officers of the guard, with the other

NA
â€œYour eminence doesnâ€™t know those walls; they are sixty feet high and I
doubt if Monsieur de Beaufort is sufficiently weary of life to risk his

NA
NA
â€œThat unless Monsieur de Beaufort can contrive to metamorphose himself

NA
Beaufort told the guards who took him to Vincennes that he had often
thought what he should do in case he were put into prison, and that he

â€œMy lord, if among these forty there had been one good way he would have

NA
â€œBesides, my lord must remember that Monsieur de Chavigny is governor of

NA
â€œOh! when I leave him, I place in my stead a bold fellow who aspires to
be his majestyâ€™s special guard. I promise you he keeps a good watch over
the prisoner. During the three weeks that he has been with me, I have
only had to reproach him with one thing--being too severe with the

NA
NA
NA
â€œHe was in the country, as I was told by the person who recommended him

answers only by signs. It seems his former master accustomed him to

misdeeds and put on his back a uniform to make him respectable, and in
the pockets of that uniform some pistoles to drink to the kingâ€™s
NA
Mazarin was large in promises,--quite unlike the virtuous Monsieur
Grimaud so bepraised by La Ramee; for he said nothing and did much.
It was now nine oâ€™clock. The cardinal, therefore, got up, perfumed
himself, dressed, and went to the queen to tell her what had detained
him. The queen, who was scarcely less afraid of Monsieur de Beaufort
than the cardinal himself, and who was almost as superstitious as he
was, made him repeat word for word all La Rameeâ€™s praises of his deputy.
Then, when the cardinal had ended:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
And he wrote to Dâ€™Artagnan to hasten his return.
17. Duc de Beaufort amused his Leisure Hours in the Donjon of Vincennes.
The captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and
whose means of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court, was
wholly unconscious of the terror he caused at the Palais Royal.
He had found himself so strictly guarded that he soon perceived the
fruitlessness of any attempt at escape. His vengeance, therefore,
consisted in coining curses on the head of Mazarin; he even tried to
make some verses on him, but soon gave up the attempt, for Monsieur de
Beaufort had not only not received from Heaven the gift of versifying,
he had the greatest difficulty in expressing himself in prose.
The duke was the grandson of Henry IV. and Gabrielle dâ€™Estrees--as
good-natured, as brave, as proud, and above all, as Gascon as his
ancestor, but less elaborately educated. After having been for some time
after the death of Louis XIII. the favorite, the confidant, the first
man, in short, at the court, he had been obliged to yield his place to
Mazarin and so became the second in influence and favor; and eventually,
as he was stupid enough to be vexed at this change of position, the
queen had had him arrested and sent to Vincennes in charge of Guitant,
who made his appearance in these pages in the beginning of this history
and whom we shall see again. It is understood, of course, that when we
NA
During the five years of this seclusion, which would have improved and
matured the intellect of any other man, M. de Beaufort, had he not
affected to brave the cardinal, despise princes, and walk alone without
adherents or disciples, would either have regained his liberty or made
partisans. But these considerations never occurred to the duke and every
day the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant
as possible to the minister.
After having failed in poetry, Monsieur de Beaufort tried drawing. He
drew portraits, with a piece of coal, of the cardinal; and as his
talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness, he wrote
under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the
NA
Chavigny, the governor of Vincennes, waited upon the duke to request
that he would amuse himself in some other way, or that at all events, if
he drew likenesses, he would not put mottoes underneath them. The next
day the prisonerâ€™s room was full of pictures and mottoes. Monsieur de
Beaufort, in common with many other prisoners, was bent upon doing
things that were prohibited; and the only resource the governor had was,
one day when the duke was playing at tennis, to efface all these
drawings, consisting chiefly of profiles. M. de Beaufort did not venture
to draw the cardinalâ€™s fat face.
The duke thanked Monsieur de Chavigny for having, as he said, cleaned
his drawing-paper for him; he then divided the walls of his room into
compartments and dedicated each of these compartments to some incident

saving that â€œit was quite enough for the king of France to have clean

The governor, of course, thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if
he did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to deprive
him of all the means of amusing himself in that manner. To this Monsieur
de Beaufort replied that since every opportunity of distinguishing
himself in arms was taken from him, he wished to make himself celebrated
in the arts; since he could not be a Bayard, he would become a Raphael
or a Michael Angelo. Nevertheless, one day when Monsieur de Beaufort was
walking in the meadow his fire was put out, his charcoal all removed,
taken away; and thus his means of drawing utterly destroyed.
The poor duke swore, fell into a rage, yelled, and declared that they
wished to starve him to death as they had starved the Marechal Ornano
and the Grand Prior of Vendome; but he refused to promise that he would
not make any more drawings and remained without any fire in the room all
the winter.
His next act was to purchase a dog from one of his keepers. With this
animal, which he called Pistache, he was often shut up for hours alone,
superintending, as every one supposed, its education. At last, when
Pistache was sufficiently well trained, Monsieur de Beaufort invited the
governor and officers of Vincennes to attend a representation which he
was going to have in his apartment.
The party assembled, the room was lighted with waxlights, and the
prisoner, with a bit of plaster he had taken out of the wall of his
room, had traced a long white line, representing a cord, on the floor.
Pistache, on a signal from his master, placed himself on this line,
raised himself on his hind paws, and holding in his front paws a wand
with which clothes used to be beaten, he began to dance upon the line
with as many contortions as a rope-dancer. Having been several times up
and down it, he gave the wand back to his master and began without
hesitation to perform the same evolutions over again.
The intelligent creature was received with loud applause.
The first part of the entertainment being concluded Pistache was desired
to say what oâ€™clock it was; he was shown Monsieur de Chavignyâ€™s watch;
it was then half-past six; the dog raised and dropped his paw six times;
the seventh he let it remain upraised. Nothing could be better done; a
sun-dial could not have shown the hour with greater precision.
Then the question was put to him who was the best jailer in all the
prisons in France.
The dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself,
with the deepest respect, at the feet of Monsieur de Chavigny, who at
first seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud, but a
frown succeeded, and he bit his lips with vexation.
Then the duke put to Pistache this difficult question, who was the
greatest thief in the world?
Pistache went again around the circle, but stopped at no one, and at
last went to the door and began to scratch and bark.
NA
finding here what I ask for, seeks it out of doors; you shall, however,
have his answer. Pistache, my friend, come here. Is not the greatest

again addressed them--â€œdo you not remember that the Duc de Guise taught
all the dogs in Paris to jump for Mademoiselle de Pons, whom he styled
â€˜the fairest of the fair?â€™ Pistache is going to show you how superior he
is to all other dogs. Monsieur de Chavigny, be so good as to lend me

Monsieur de Chavigny handed his cane to Monsieur de Beaufort. Monsieur
de Beaufort placed it horizontally at the height of one foot.
â€œNow, Pistache, my good dog, jump the height of this cane for Madame de

The dog sprang, and in spite of the height jumped lightly over it.

The dog obeyed and jumped quickly over the cane.

The dog turned his back to the cane.
NA
again, first making a semicircle from the head to the tail of Pistache.
NA
But Pistache, as at first, turned round on his legs and stood with his
back to the cane.
Monsieur de Beaufort made the experiment a third time, but by this time
Pistacheâ€™s patience was exhausted; he threw himself furiously upon the
cane, wrested it from the hands of the prince and broke it with his
teeth.
Monsieur de Beaufort took the pieces out of his mouth and presented them
with great formality to Monsieur de Chavigny, saying that for that
evening the entertainment was ended, but in three months it should be
repeated, when Pistache would have learned a few new tricks.
Three days afterward Pistache was found dead--poisoned.
Then the duke said openly that his dog had been killed by a drug with
which they meant to poison him; and one day after dinner he went to bed,
calling out that he had pains in his stomach and that Mazarin had
poisoned him.
This fresh impertinence reached the ears of the cardinal and alarmed him
greatly. The donjon of Vincennes was considered very unhealthy and
Madame de Rambouillet had said that the room in which the Marechal
Ornano and the Grand Prior de Vendome had died was worth its weight in
arsenic--a bon mot which had great success. So it was ordered the
prisoner was henceforth to eat nothing that had not previously been
tasted, and La Ramee was in consequence placed near him as taster.
Every kind of revenge was practiced upon the duke by the governor in
return for the insults of the innocent Pistache. De Chavigny, who,
according to report, was a son of Richelieuâ€™s, and had been a creature
of the late cardinalâ€™s, understood tyranny. He took from the duke all
the steel knives and silver forks and replaced them with silver knives
and wooden forks, pretending that as he had been informed that the duke
was to pass all his life at Vincennes, he was afraid of his prisoner
attempting suicide. A fortnight afterward the duke, going to the tennis
court, found two rows of trees about the size of his little finger
planted by the roadside; he asked what they were for and was told that
they were to shade him from the sun on some future day. One morning the
gardener went to him and told him, as if to please him, that he was
going to plant a bed of asparagus for his especial use. Now, since, as
every one knows, asparagus takes four years in coming to perfection,
this civility infuriated Monsieur de Beaufort.
At last his patience was exhausted. He assembled his keepers, and
notwithstanding his well-known difficulty of utterance, addressed them
as follows:
â€œGentlemen! will you permit a grandson of Henry IV. to be overwhelmed
with insults and ignominy?
â€œOdds fish! as my grandfather used to say, I once reigned in Paris! do
you know that? I had the king and Monsieur the whole of one day in my
care. The queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man
in the kingdom. Gentlemen and citizens, set me free; I shall go to the
Louvre and strangle Mazarin. You shall be my body-guard. I will make you
NA
But eloquent as he might be, the eloquence of the grandson of Henry IV.
did not touch those hearts of stone; not one man stirred, so Monsieur de
Beaufort was obliged to be satisfied with calling them all kinds of
rascals underneath the sun.
Sometimes, when Monsieur de Chavigny paid him a visit, the duke used to
ask him what he should think if he saw an army of Parisians, all fully
armed, appear at Vincennes to deliver him from prison.
NA
twenty pieces of artillery and in my casemates thirty thousand guns. I
should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was
NA
â€œYes, but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would
take the donjon; the donjon being taken, I should be obliged to let them

And in his turn the duke bowed low to Monsieur de Chavigny.
NA
the first rebel should pass the threshold of my postern doors I should
be obliged to kill you with my own hand, since you were confided
peculiarly to my care and as I am obliged to give you up, dead or
NA
And once more he bowed low before his highness.
These bitter-sweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes, sometimes longer,
but always finished thus:
Monsieur de Chavigny, turning toward the door, used to call out:
NA
La Ramee came into the room.
â€œLa Ramee, I recommend Monsieur le Duc to you, particularly; treat him
as a man of his rank and family ought to be treated; that is, never
NA
La Ramee became, therefore, the dukeâ€™s dinner guest by compulsion--an
eternal keeper, the shadow of his person; but La Ramee--gay, frank,
convivial, fond of play, a great hand at tennis, had one defect in the
dukeâ€™s eyes--his incorruptibility.
Now, although La Ramee appreciated, as of a certain value, the honor of
being shut up with a prisoner of so great importance, still the pleasure
of living in intimacy with the grandson of Henry IV. hardly compensated
for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time
to visit his family.
One may be a jailer or a keeper and at the same time a good father and
husband. La Ramee adored his wife and children, whom now he could only
catch a glimpse of from the top of the wall, when in order to please him
they used to walk on the opposite side of the moat. â€˜Twas too brief an
enjoyment, and La Ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded as
the cause of health (of which it was perhaps rather the result) would
not long survive such a mode of life.
He accepted, therefore, with delight, an offer made to him by his friend
the steward of the Duc de Grammont, to give him a substitute; he also
spoke of it to Monsieur de Chavigny, who promised that he would not
oppose it in any way--that is, if he approved of the person proposed.
We consider it useless to draw a physical or moral portrait of Grimaud;
if, as we hope, our readers have not wholly forgotten the first part of
this work, they must have preserved a clear idea of that estimable
individual, who is wholly unchanged, except that he is twenty years
older, an advance in life that has made him only more silent; although,
since the change that had been working in himself, Athos had given
Grimaud permission to speak.
But Grimaud had for twelve or fifteen years preserved habitual silence,
and a habit of fifteen or twenty yearsâ€™ duration becomes second nature.
18. Grimaud begins his Functions.
Grimaud thereupon presented himself with his smooth exterior at the
donjon of Vincennes. Now Monsieur de Chavigny piqued himself on his
infallible penetration; for that which almost proved that he was the son
of Richelieu was his everlasting pretension; he examined attentively the
countenance of the applicant for place and fancied that the contracted
eyebrows, thin lips, hooked nose, and prominent cheek-bones of Grimaud
were favorable signs. He addressed about twelve words to him; Grimaud
answered in four.
NA
NA
NA
Grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to
have a deputy. So, after a thousand questions which met with only a word
in reply, La Ramee, fascinated by this sobriety in speech, rubbed his
hands and engaged Grimaud.
NA
â€œThey are these; never to leave the prisoner alone; to keep away from
him every pointed or cutting instrument, and to prevent his conversing
NA
NA
NA
NA
The duke was in the act of combing his beard, which he had allowed to
grow, as well as his hair, in order to reproach Mazarin with his
wretched appearance and condition. But having some days previously seen
from the top of the donjon Madame de Montbazon pass in her carriage, and
still cherishing an affection for that beautiful woman, he did not wish
to be to her what he wished to be to Mazarin, and in the hope of seeing
her again, had asked for a leaden comb, which was allowed him. The comb
was to be a leaden one, because his beard, like that of most fair
people, was rather red; he therefore dyed it thus whilst combing it.
As Grimaud entered he saw this comb on the tea-table; he took it up, and
as he took it he made a low bow.
The duke looked at this strange figure with surprise. The figure put the
comb in its pocket.
NA
Grimaud did not answer, but bowed a second time.
NA
Grimaud made a sign that he was not.

La Ramee ran in haste to obey the call.

NA
The duke looked furiously at Grimaud.
NA
muttered.
Grimaud, nevertheless, was resolved for certain reasons not at once to
come to a full rupture with the prisoner; he wanted to inspire, not a
sudden repugnance, but a good, sound, steady hatred; he retired,
therefore, and gave place to four guards, who, having breakfasted, could
attend on the prisoner.
A fresh practical joke now occurred to the duke. He had asked for
crawfish for his breakfast on the following morning; he intended to pass
the day in making a small gallows and hang one of the finest of these
fish in the middle of his room--the red color evidently conveying an
allusion to the cardinal--so that he might have the pleasure of hanging
Mazarin in effigy without being accused of having hung anything more
significant than a crawfish.
The day was employed in preparations for the execution. Every one grows
childish in prison, but the character of Monsieur de Beaufort was
particularly disposed to become so. In the course of his morningâ€™s walk
he collected two or three small branches from a tree and found a small
piece of broken glass, a discovery that quite delighted him. When he
came home he formed his handkerchief into a loop.
Nothing of all this escaped Grimaud, but La Ramee looked on with the
curiosity of a father who thinks that he may perhaps get a cheap idea
concerning a new toy for his children. The guards looked on it with
indifference. When everything was ready, the gallows hung in the middle
of the room, the loop made, and when the duke had cast a glance upon the
plate of crawfish, in order to select the finest specimen among them, he
looked around for his piece of glass; it had disappeared.
NA
made a sign to denote that he had done so.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
And he took the gibbet and shaped it out as neatly as possible.
NA
NA
La Ramee knelt down and made a hole in the floor; meanwhile the duke
hung the crawfish up by a thread. Then he placed the gibbet in the
middle of the room, bursting with laughter.
La Ramee laughed also and the guards laughed in chorus; Grimaud,
however, did not even smile. He approached La Ramee and showing him the
crawfish hung up by the thread:
NA
NA
laughing violently, â€œand by Master Jacques Chrysostom La Ramee, the
NA
La Ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet, which he
broke at once and threw the pieces out of the window. He was going to
throw the crawfish out also, when Grimaud snatched it from his hands.
NA
This scene so enchanted the duke that at the moment he forgave Grimaud
for his part in it; but on reflection he hated him more and more, being
convinced he had some evil motive for his conduct.
But the story of the crab made a great noise through the interior of the
donjon and even outside. Monsieur de Chavigny, who at heart detested the
cardinal, took pains to tell the story to two or three friends, who put
it into immediate circulation.
The prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very
good countenance; and he favored this man the more as Grimaud became the
more and more odious to him. One morning he took this man on one side
and had succeeded in speaking to him, when Grimaud entered and seeing
what was going on approached the duke respectfully, but took the guard
by the arm.
NA
The guard obeyed.
NA
Grimaud bowed.
NA
Grimaud bowed, but stepped back.
NA
NA
And he extended his hands toward Grimaud, who merely thrust the guard
out and shut the door behind him. At the same time he felt the dukeâ€™s
arms on his shoulders like two iron claws; but instead either of calling
out or defending himself, he placed his forefinger on his lips and said
in a low tone:
NA
A gesture, a smile and a word from Grimaud, all at once, were so unusual
that his highness stopped short, astounded.
Grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming
little note with an aristocratic seal, and presented it to the duke
without a word.
The duke, more and more bewildered, let Grimaud loose and took the note.
NA
Grimaud nodded assent.
The duke tore open the note, passed his hands over his eyes, for he was
dazzled and confused, and read:
â€œMy Dear Duke,--You may entirely confide in the brave lad who will give
you this note; he has consented to enter the service of your keeper and
to shut himself up at Vincennes with you, in order to prepare and assist
your escape, which we are contriving. The moment of your deliverance is
at hand; have patience and courage and remember that in spite of time
and absence all your friends continue to cherish for you the sentiments
they have so long professed and truly entertained.
â€œYours wholly and most affectionately
â€œMarie de Montbazon.
â€œP.S.--I sign my full name, for I should be vain if I could suppose that
NA
The poor duke became perfectly giddy. What for five years he had been
wanting--a faithful servant, a friend, a helping hand--seemed to have
fallen from Heaven just when he expected it the least.
â€œOh, dearest Marie! she thinks of me, then, after five years of

said:
NA
Grimaud signified his assent.
NA
Grimaud repeated the sign.
NA
Grimaud smiled.

continued, renewing his fruitless search; â€œit shall not be said that
NA
The dukeâ€™s endeavors evinced the best intention in the world, but one of
the precautions taken at Vincennes was that of allowing prisoners to
keep no money. Whereupon Grimaud, observing the dukeâ€™s disappointment,
drew from his pocket a purse filled with gold and handed it to him.
NA
The duke opened the purse and wanted to empty it into Grimaudâ€™s hands,
but Grimaud shook his head.
NA
The duke went from one surprise to another. He held out his hand.
Grimaud drew near and kissed it respectfully. The grand manner of Athos
had left its mark on Grimaud.

Grimaud made a sign that he was going away.

always first; for if my lord should be overtaken and caught, thereâ€™s
every chance of his being brought back to prison, whereas if I am caught

NA
NA
NA
NA
At this moment La Ramee, after the interview we have described with the
cardinal, entered the room. The duke had thrown himself, as he was wont
to do in moments of dullness and vexation, on his bed. La Ramee cast an
inquiring look around him and observing the same signs of antipathy
between the prisoner and his guardian he smiled in token of his inward
satisfaction. Then turning to Grimaud:
â€œVery good, my friend, very good. You have been spoken of in a promising
quarter and you will soon, I hope, have news that will be agreeable to
NA
Grimaud saluted in his politest manner and withdrew, as was his custom
on the entrance of his superior.
NA
NA
â€œSo! â€˜tis you, La Ramee; in faith, â€˜tis time you came back again. I
threw myself on the bed and turned my nose to the wall, that I mightnâ€™t

â€œVery well, let us say no more about it. So you and the cardinal have

â€œWhy, good Lord! this man, your highness, when he saw me stop before his
shop, where he has a display of things which would make your mouth
water, my lord, asked me to get him the custom of the prisoners in the
donjon. â€˜I bought,â€™ said he, â€˜the business of my predecessor on the
strength of his assurance that he supplied the castle; whereas, on my
honor, Monsieur de Chavigny, though Iâ€™ve been here a week, has not
ordered so much as a tartlet.â€™ â€˜But,â€™ I then replied, â€˜probably Monsieur
de Chavigny is afraid your pastry is not good.â€™ â€˜My pastry not good!
Well, Monsieur La Ramee, you shall judge of it yourself and at once.â€™ â€˜I
cannot,â€™ I replied; â€˜it is absolutely necessary for me to return to the
chateau.â€™ â€˜Very well,â€™ said he, â€˜go and attend to your affairs, since
you seem to be in a hurry, but come back in half an hour.â€™ â€˜In half an
hour?â€™ â€˜Yes, have you breakfasted?â€™ â€˜Faith, no.â€™ â€˜Well, here is a pate
that will be ready for you, with a bottle of old Burgundy.â€™ So, you see,
NA
La Ramee bent low.
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, if he does not put mushrooms in his pies; thou knowest that
NA
La Ramee went out, but in five minutes one of the officers of the guard
entered in compliance with the strict orders of the cardinal that the
prisoner should never be left alone a moment.
But during these five minutes the duke had had time to read again the
note from Madame de Montbazon, which proved to the prisoner that his
friends were concerting plans for his deliverance, but in what way he
knew not.
But his confidence in Grimaud, whose petty persecutions he now perceived
were only a blind, increased, and he conceived the highest opinion of
his intellect and resolved to trust entirely to his guidance.
19. Pates made by the Successor of Father Marteau are described.
In half an hour La Ramee returned, full of glee, like most men who have
eaten, and more especially drank to their heartâ€™s content. The pates
were excellent, the wine delicious.
The weather was fine and the game at tennis took place in the open air.
At two oâ€™clock the tennis balls began, according to Grimaudâ€™s
directions, to take the direction of the moat, much to the joy of La
Ramee, who marked fifteen whenever the duke sent a ball into the moat;
and very soon balls were wanting, so many had gone over. La Ramee then
proposed to send some one to pick them up, but the duke remarked that it
would be losing time; and going near the rampart himself and looking
over, he saw a man working in one of the numerous little gardens cleared
out by the peasants on the opposite side of the moat.
NA
The man raised his head and the duke was about to utter a cry of
surprise. The peasant, the gardener, was Rochefort, whom he believed to
be in the Bastile.
NA
NA
The gardener nodded and began to fling up the balls, which were picked
up by La Ramee and the guard. One, however, fell at the dukeâ€™s feet, and
seeing that it was intended for him, he put it into his pocket.
La Ramee was in ecstasies at having beaten a prince of the blood.
The duke went indoors and retired to bed, where he spent, indeed, the
greater part of every day, as they had taken his books away. La Ramee
carried off all his clothes, in order to be certain that the duke would
not stir. However, the duke contrived to hide the ball under his bolster
and as soon as the door was closed he tore off the cover of the ball
with his teeth and found underneath the following letter:
My Lord,--Your friends are watching over you and the hour of your
deliverance is at hand. Ask day after to-morrow to have a pie supplied
you by the new confectioner opposite the castle, and who is no other
than Noirmont, your former maitre dâ€™hotel. Do not open the pie till you
are alone. I hope you will be satisfied with its contents.
â€œYour highnessâ€™s most devoted servant,
â€œIn the Bastile, as elsewhere,
NA
The duke, who had latterly been allowed a fire, burned the letter, but
kept the ball, and went to bed, hiding the ball under his bolster. La
Ramee entered; he smiled kindly on the prisoner, for he was an excellent
man and had taken a great liking for the captive prince. He endeavored
to cheer him up in his solitude.
NA

â€œBut tete-a-tete. Send the guards to take their meal in the canteen of

NA
The proposal was seductive, but La Ramee was an old stager, acquainted
with all the traps a prisoner was likely to set. Monsieur de Beaufort
had said that he had forty ways of getting out of prison. Did this
proposed breakfast cover some stratagem? He reflected, but he remembered
that he himself would have charge of the food and the wine and therefore
that no powder could be mixed with the food, no drug with the wine. As
to getting him drunk, the duke couldnâ€™t hope to do that, and he laughed
at the mere thought of it. Then an idea came to him which harmonized
everything.
The duke had followed with anxiety La Rameeâ€™s unspoken soliloquy,
reading it from point to point upon his face. But presently the exemptâ€™s
face suddenly brightened.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Nothing could be more agreeable to the duke, however, he had presence of
mind enough to exclaim:
NA
â€œI will direct him to stand behind your chair, and since he doesnâ€™t
speak, your highness will neither see nor hear him and with a little

â€œDo you know, my friend, I find one thing very evident in all this, you

NA
NA
NA
La Ramee was going out. He stopped, however, at the door for an instant.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Five minutes afterward the officer entered and the duke seemed to be
immersed in the sublime combinations of chess.
A strange thing is the mind, and it is wonderful what revolutions may be
wrought in it by a sign, a word, a hope. The duke had been five years in
prison, and now to him, looking back upon them, those five years, which
had passed so slowly, seemed not so long a time as were the two days,
the forty-eight hours, which still parted him from the time fixed for
his escape. Besides, there was one thing that engaged his most anxious
thought--in what way was the escape to be effected? They had told him to
hope for it, but had not told him what was to be hidden in the
mysterious pate. And what friends awaited him without? He had friends,
then, after five years in prison? If that were so he was indeed a highly
favored prince. He forgot that besides his friends of his own sex, a
woman, strange to say, had remembered him. It is true that she had not,
perhaps, been scrupulously faithful to him, but she had remembered him;
that was something.
So the duke had more than enough to think about; accordingly he fared at
chess as he had fared at tennis; he made blunder upon blunder and the
officer with whom he played found him easy game.
But his successive defeats did service to the duke in one way--they
killed time for him till eight oâ€™clock in the evening; then would come
night, and with night, sleep. So, at least, the duke believed; but sleep
is a capricious fairy, and it is precisely when one invokes her presence
that she is most likely to keep him waiting. The duke waited until
midnight, turning on his mattress like St. Laurence on his gridiron.
Finally he slept.
But at daybreak he awoke. Wild dreams had disturbed his repose. He
dreamed that he was endowed with wings--he wished to fly away. For a
time these wings supported him, but when he reached a certain height
this new aid failed him. His wings were broken and he seemed to sink
into a bottomless abyss, whence he awoke, bathed in perspiration and
nearly as much overcome as if he had really fallen. He fell asleep again
and another vision appeared. He was in a subterranean passage by which
he was to leave Vincennes. Grimaud was walking before him with a
lantern. By degrees the passage narrowed, yet the duke continued his
course. At last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to
proceed. The sides of the walls seem to close in, even to press against
him. He made fruitless efforts to go on; it was impossible.
Nevertheless, he still saw Grimaud with his lantern in front, advancing.
He wished to call out to him but could not utter a word. Then at the
other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him.
These steps came on, came fast. He was discovered; all hope of flight
was gone. Still the walls seemed to be closing on him; they appeared to
be in concert with his enemies. At last he heard the voice of La Ramee.
La Ramee took his hand and laughed aloud. He was captured again, and
conducted to the low and vaulted chamber, in which Ornano, Puylaurens,
and his uncle had died. Their three graves were there, rising above the
ground, and a fourth was also there, yawning for its ghastly tenant.
The duke was obliged to make as many efforts to awake as he had done to
go to sleep; and La Ramee found him so pale and fatigued that he
inquired whether he was ill.
NA
had been kept awake by a toothache, brought on by the dampness of the
atmosphere, â€œmy lord has had a very restless night and two or three

NA
NA

The duke saw that he had not controlled himself as he ought, but at that
moment, as if he had listened at the door and comprehended the urgent
need of diverting La Rameeâ€™s ideas, Grimaud entered and made a sign to
La Ramee that he had something to say to him.
La Ramee drew near to Grimaud, who spoke to him in a low voice.
The duke meanwhile recovered his self-control.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œMy lord will remember that it was agreed between us that he should wait

â€œMy lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to

La Ramee continued: â€œMy lord has done me the honor to invite me to a

Grimaud made a sign which meant that he didnâ€™t see what that had to do
with him.

Grimaud bowed in thanks.

The duke tried to exchange a glance with Grimaud, but there was no
glance in Grimaudâ€™s eyes.
NA
â€œDoes your highness wish to take revenge for the game of tennis

Grimaud intimated by a scarcely perceptible nod that he should consent.
NA
NA
La Ramee went out. Grimaud looked after him, and when the door was
closed he drew out of his pocket a pencil and a sheet of paper.
NA
NA
Grimaud dictated.
â€œAll is ready for to-morrow evening. Keep watch from seven to nine. Have
two riding horses ready. We shall descend by the first window in the

gave a grim smile.

20. One of Marie Michonâ€™s Adventures.
Whilst these projects were being formed by the Duc de Beaufort and
Grimaud, the Comte de la Fere and the Vicomte de Bragelonne were
entering Paris by the Rue du Faubourg Saint Marcel.
They stopped at the sign of the Fox, in the Rue du Vieux Colombier, a
tavern known for many years by Athos, and asked for two bedrooms.
NA
NA
NA
NA
The young man bowed. Perhaps, not being endowed with the endurance of
Athos, who seemed to be made of iron, he would have preferred a bath in
the river Seine of which he had heard so much, and afterward his bed;
but the Comte de la Fere had spoken and he had no thought but to obey.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Athos, in his turn, smiled also.
â€œNo, donâ€™t be alarmed, although it is to a lady that I am going to
NA
The young man looked at the count with a certain uneasiness, but at a
smile from Athos he was quickly reassured.
NA
â€œMy dear Raoul, learn, once for all, that that is a question which is
never asked. When you can find out a womanâ€™s age by her face, it is
NA
NA
â€œSixteen years ago she was deemed not only the prettiest, but the most
NA
This reply reassured the vicomte. A woman who had been a reigning beauty
a year before he was born could not be the subject of any scheme for
him. He retired to his toilet. When he reappeared, Athos received him
with the same paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on
Dâ€™Artagnan, but a more profound tenderness for Raoul was now visibly
impressed upon his face.
Athos cast a glance at his feet, hands and hair--those three marks of
race. The youthâ€™s dark hair was neatly parted and hung in curls, forming
a sort of dark frame around his face; such was the fashion of the day.
Gloves of gray kid, matching the hat, well displayed the form of a
slender and elegant hand; whilst his boots, similar in color to the hat
and gloves, confined feet small as those of a boy twelve years old.
NA
NA
It was three oâ€™clock in the afternoon. The two travelers proceeded to
the Rue Saint Dominique and stopped at the door of a magnificent hotel,
surmounted with the arms of De Luynes.
NA
He entered the hotel and ascended the front steps, and addressing a
footman who waited there in a grand livery, asked if the Duchess de
Chevreuse was visible and if she could receive the Comte de la Fere?
The servant returned with a message to say, that, though the duchess had
not the honor of knowing Monsieur de la Fere, she would receive him.
Athos followed the footman, who led him through a long succession of
apartments and paused at length before a closed door. Athos made a sign
to the Vicomte de Bragelonne to remain where he was.
The footman opened the door and announced Monsieur le Comte de la Fere.
Madame de Chevreuse, whose name appears so often in our story â€œThe Three
NA
still a beautiful woman. Although about forty-four or forty-five years
old, she might have passed for thirty-five. She still had her rich fair
hair; her large, animated, intelligent eyes, so often opened by
intrigue, so often closed by the blindness of love. She had still her
nymph-like form, so that when her back was turned she still was not
unlike the girl who had jumped, with Anne of Austria, over the moat of
the Tuileries in 1563. In all other respects she was the same mad
creature who threw over her amours such an air of originality as to make
them proverbial for eccentricity in her family.
She was in a little boudoir, hung with blue damask, adorned by red
flowers, with a foliage of gold, looking upon a garden; and reclined
upon a sofa, her head supported on the rich tapestry which covered it.
She held a book in her hand and her arm was supported by a cushion.
At the footmanâ€™s announcement she raised herself a little and peeped
out, with some curiosity.
Athos appeared.
He was dressed in violet-tinted velvet, trimmed with silk of the same
color. His shoulder-knots were of burnished silver, his mantle had no
gold nor embroidery on it; a simple plume of violet feathers adorned his
hat; his boots were of black leather, and at his girdle hung that sword
with a magnificent hilt that Porthos had so often admired in the Rue
Feron. Splendid lace adorned the falling collar of his shirt, and lace
fell also over the top of his boots.
In his whole person he bore such an impress of high degree, that Madame
de Chevreuse half rose from her seat when she saw him and made him a
sign to sit down near her.
Athos bowed and obeyed. The footman was withdrawing, but Athos stopped
him by a sign.
NA
myself at your hotel without being known to you; it has succeeded, since
you deign to receive me. I have now the boldness to ask you for an
NA
NA
gracious smile.
â€œBut that is not all, madame. Oh, I am very presuming, I am aware. The
interview for which I ask is of us two alone, and I very earnestly wish
NA
NA
NA
The footman went out.
There ensued a brief silence, during which these two persons, who at
first sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race, examined
each other without embarrassment on either side.
The duchess was the first to speak.
â€œWell, sir, I am waiting with impatience to hear what you wish to say to
NA
NA
NA
to whom I am talking. You belong to the court, doubtless, yet I have

NA
â€œAh! then tell me who you are, and get along with you upon your

â€œWho I am, madame? My name has been mentioned to you--the Comte de la
Fere; you do not know that name. I once bore another, which you knew,
NA
NA
NA
Madame de Chevreuse looked astonished. The name was not wholly
forgotten, but mixed up and confused with ancient recollections.
NA
And she placed her hands on her brow, as if to force the fugitive ideas
it contained to concentration in a moment.

NA
â€œThis Athos was connected with three young musketeers, named Porthos,

He stopped short.

Aramis, that Marie Michon, that needlewoman, notwithstanding her low
condition, had acquaintances in the highest rank; she called the
grandest ladies of the court her friend, and the queen--proud as she is,
in her double character as Austrian and as Spaniard--called her her

send her to the Chateau de Loches. Fortunately the affair was not
managed so secretly but that it became known to the queen. The case had
been provided for: if Marie Michon should be threatened with any danger
NA
NA
â€œOne morning the green book was brought to her by the Prince de
Marsillac. There was no time to lose. Happily Marie and a follower of
hers named Kitty could disguise themselves admirably in menâ€™s clothes.
The prince procured for Marie Michon the dress of a cavalier and for
Kitty that of a lackey; he sent them two excellent horses, and the
fugitives went out hastily from Tours, shaping their course toward
Spain, trembling at the least noise, following unfrequented roads, and
asking for hospitality when they found themselves where there was no

NA
NA

them only to a little village in Limousin, lying between Tulle and

Madame de Chevreuse uttered a cry of surprise, and looked at Athos with
an expression of astonishment that made the old musketeer smile.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThe journey of that day had been long and wearing; it was a cold day,
the eleventh of October, there was no inn or chateau in the village and
the homes of the peasants were poor and unattractive. Marie Michon was a
very aristocratic person; like her sister the queen, she had been
accustomed to pleasing perfumes and fine linen; she resolved, therefore,
NA
Athos paused.
NA
NA
â€œThe two travelers knocked at the door. It was late; the priest, who had
gone to bed, cried out to them to come in. They entered, for the door
was not locked--there is much confidence among villagers. A lamp burned
in the chamber occupied by the priest. Marie Michon, who made the most
charming cavalier in the world, pushed open the door, put her head in
and asked for hospitality. â€˜Willingly, my young cavalier,â€™ said the
priest, â€˜if you will be content with the remains of my supper and with
half my chamber.â€™
â€œThe two travelers consulted for a moment. The priest heard a burst of
laughter and then the master, or rather, the mistress, replied: â€˜Thank
you, monsieur le cure, I accept.â€™ â€˜Sup, then, and make as little noise
as possible,â€™ said the priest, â€˜for I, too, have been on the go all day
NA
Madame de Chevreuse evidently went from surprise to astonishment, and
from astonishment to stupefaction. Her face, as she looked at Athos, had
taken on an expression that cannot be described. It could be seen that
she had wished to speak, but she had remained silent through fear of
losing one of her companionâ€™s words.
NA
NA
â€œSpeak, speak! One can say anything to me. Besides, it doesnâ€™t concern
NA
NA
with her follower, and then, in accordance with the permission given
her, she entered the chamber of her host, Kitty meanwhile taking
possession of an armchair in the room first entered, where they had
NA
NA
in person I donâ€™t know how you could become acquainted with all these
NA
NA
wild creatures who are constantly conceiving the strangest ideas. Now,
thinking that her host was a priest, that coquette took it into her head
that it would be a happy souvenir for her old age, among the many happy
souvenirs she already possessed, if she could win that of having damned

Athos laughed. â€œNothing is easier, madame. A cavalier, charged with an
important mission, had come an hour before your arrival, seeking
hospitality, at the very moment that the cure, summoned to the bedside
of a dying person, left not only his house but the village, for the
entire night. The priest having all confidence in his guest, who,
besides, was a nobleman, had left to him his house, his supper and his
chamber. And therefore Marie came seeking hospitality from the guest of

respectfully to the Duchess de Chevreuse.
The duchess remained a moment stupefied; then, suddenly bursting into
laughter:

Michon fared better than she expected. Sit down, dear count, and go on
NA
â€œAt this point I have to accuse myself of a fault, madame. I have told
you that I was traveling on an important mission. At daybreak I left the
chamber without noise, leaving my charming companion asleep. In the
front room the follower was also still asleep, her head leaning back on
the chair, in all respects worthy of her mistress. Her pretty face
arrested my attention; I approached and recognized that little Kitty
whom our friend Aramis had placed with her. In that way I discovered

NA
NA
â€œI wanted to see the good cure again. I found him much preoccupied with
an event that he could not at all comprehend. A week before he had
received, in a cradle, a beautiful little boy three months old, with a
purse filled with gold and a note containing these simple words: â€˜11

NA

â€œYes, but he couldnâ€™t understand what it meant, for he had spent that

â€œYou must know, monsieur, that Marie Michon, when she returned to France

over his education and I have made him, I hope, an accomplished

which I may be killed. Then it will devolve on you to push him on in

Athos moved toward the door; the duchess held him back.
NA
Athos smiled.

So he opened the door and beckoned the young man in.
The duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a
young cavalier, so far surpassing all that her maternal pride had been
able to conceive.

The youth approached with his charming smile and his head bare, and
kneeling down, kissed the hand of the Duchess de Chevreuse.

21. The Abbe Scarron.
There was once in the Rue des Tournelles a house known by all the sedan
chairmen and footmen of Paris, and yet, nevertheless, this house was
neither that of a great lord nor of a rich man. There was neither
dining, nor playing at cards, nor dancing in that house. Nevertheless,
it was the rendezvous of the great world and all Paris went there. It
was the abode of the little Abbe Scarron.
In the home of the witty abbe dwelt incessant laughter; there all the
items of the day had their source and were so quickly transformed,
misrepresented, metamorphosed, some into epigrams, some into falsehoods,
that every one was anxious to pass an hour with little Scarron,
listening to what he said, reporting it to others.
The diminutive Abbe Scarron, who, however, was an abbe only because he
owned an abbey, and not because he was in orders, had formerly been one
of the gayest prebendaries in the town of Mans, which he inhabited. On a
day of the carnival he had taken a notion to provide an unusual
entertainment for that good town, of which he was the life and soul. He
had made his valet cover him with honey; then, opening a feather bed, he
had rolled in it and had thus become the most grotesque fowl it is
possible to imagine. He then began to visit his friends of both sexes,
in that strange costume. At first he had been followed through
astonishment, then with derisive shouts, then the porters had insulted
him, then children had thrown stones at him, and finally he was obliged
to run, to escape the missiles. As soon as he took to flight every one
pursued him, until, pressed on all sides, Scarron found no way of
escaping his escort, except by throwing himself into the river; but the
water was icy cold. Scarron was heated, the cold seized on him, and when
he reached the farther bank he found himself crippled.
Every means had been employed in vain to restore the use of his limbs.
He had been subjected to a severe disciplinary course of medicine, at
length he sent away all his doctors, declaring that he preferred the
disease to the treatment, and came to Paris, where the fame of his wit
had preceded him. There he had a chair made on his own plan, and one
day, visiting Anne of Austria in this chair, she asked him, charmed as
she was with his wit, if he did not wish for a title.
NA
Scarron.
NA
NA
So he was called the queenâ€™s invalid, with a pension of fifteen hundred
francs.
From that lucky moment Scarron led a happy life, spending both income
and principal. One day, however, an emissary of the cardinalâ€™s gave him
to understand that he was wrong in receiving the coadjutor so often.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Despreaux, who thinks ill of me, and you wish me to give up seeing the
NA
The conversation had rested there and Scarron, through sheer obstinacy,
had seen Monsieur de Gondy only the more frequently.
Now, the very morning of which we speak was that of his quarter-day
payment, and Scarron, as usual, had sent his servant to get his money at
the pension-office, but the man had returned and said that the
government had no more money to give Monsieur Scarron.
It was on Thursday, the abbeâ€™s reception day; people went there in
crowds. The cardinalâ€™s refusal to pay the pension was known about the
town in half an hour and he was abused with wit and vehemence.
In the Rue Saint Honore Athos fell in with two gentlemen whom he did not
know, on horseback like himself, followed by a lackey like himself, and
going in the same direction that he was. One of them, hat in hand, said
to him:
â€œWould you believe it, monsieur? that contemptible Mazarin has stopped
NA
NA
cavaliers. And they separated with courteous gestures.
NA
NA
â€œWhat, then, is this Monsieur Scarron, who thus puts all Paris in
NA
NA
of great genius who has fallen into disgrace with the cardinal through
NA
NA
NA
NA
but to make good ones increases fame--witness Monsieur de Rotrou.
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes; you are warned, vicomte. Consider well what you do in that house.
NA
NA
â€œYou will see me talking with one of my friends, the Abbe dâ€™Herblay, of
NA
NA
â€œCome near to us from time to time, as if to speak; but do not speak,
and do not listen. That little stratagem may serve to keep off
NA
NA
Athos made two visits in Paris; at seven oâ€™clock he and Raoul directed
their steps to the Rue des Tournelles; it was stopped by porters, horses
and footmen. Athos forced his way through and entered, followed by the
young man. The first person that struck him on his entrance was Aramis,
planted near a great chair on castors, very large, covered with a canopy
of tapestry, under which there moved, enveloped in a quilt of brocade, a
little face, youngish, very merry, somewhat pallid, whilst its eyes
never ceased to express a sentiment at once lively, intellectual, and
amiable. This was the Abbe Scarron, always laughing, joking,
complimenting--yet suffering--and toying nervously with a small switch.
Around this kind of rolling tent pressed a crowd of gentlemen and
ladies. The room was neatly, comfortably furnished. Large valances of
silk, embroidered with flowers of gay colors, which were rather faded,
fell from the wide windows; the fittings of the room were simple, but in
excellent taste. Two well trained servingmen were in attendance on the
company. On perceiving Athos, Aramis advanced toward him, took him by
the hand and presented him to Scarron. Raoul remained silent, for he was
not prepared for the dignity of the bel esprit.
After some minutes the door opened and a footman announced Mademoiselle
Paulet.
Athos touched the shoulder of the vicomte.
â€œLook at this lady, Raoul, she is an historic personage; it was to visit
NA
Every one thronged around Mademoiselle Paulet, for she was always very
much the fashion. She was a tall woman, with a slender figure and a
forest of golden curls, such as Raphael was fond of and Titian has
painted all his Magdalens with. This fawn-colored hair, or, perhaps the
sort of ascendancy which she had over other women, gave her the name of
NA
sitting down, she cast, in all her queen-like grandeur, a look around
the room, and her eyes rested on Raoul.
Athos smiled.
â€œMademoiselle Paulet has observed you, vicomte; go and bow to her; donâ€™t
try to appear anything but what you are, a true country youth; on no

NA
â€œPresently--there are not a sufficient number of people here yet; we

At this moment the door opened and in walked the coadjutor.
At this name every one looked around, for his was already a very
celebrated name. Athos did the same. He knew the Abbe de Gondy only by
report.
He saw a little dark man, ill made and awkward with his hands in
everything--except drawing a sword and firing a pistol--with something
haughty and contemptuous in his face.
Scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his chair.
NA
NA
This was the orthodox phrase. It had been said that evening a hundred
times--and Scarron was at his hundredth bon mot on the subject; he was
very nearly at the end of his humoristic tether, but one despairing
effort saved him.
NA
said.
NA

NA
NA

NA
At this moment the door opened and Madame de Chevreuse was announced.
Every one arose. Scarron turned his chair toward the door, Raoul
blushed, Athos made a sign to Aramis, who went and hid himself in the
enclosure of a window.
In the midst of all the compliments that awaited her on her entrance,
the duchess seemed to be looking for some one; at last she found out
Raoul and her eyes sparkled; she perceived Athos and became thoughtful;
she saw Aramis in the seclusion of the window and gave a start of
surprise behind her fan.

Raoul turned and saw two faces just arrived. One was perfectly charming,
delicate, pensive, shaded by beautiful dark hair, and eyes soft as
velvet, like those lovely flowers, the heartsease, in which shine out
the golden petals. The other, of mature age, seemed to have the former
one under her charge, and was cold, dry and yellow--the true type of a
duenna or a devotee.
Raoul resolved not to quit the room without having spoken to the
beautiful girl with the soft eyes, who by a strange fancy, although she
bore no resemblance, reminded him of his poor little Louise, whom he had
left in the Chateau de la Valliere and whom, in the midst of all the
party, he had never for one moment quite forgotten. Meantime Aramis had
drawn near to the coadjutor, who, smiling all the while, contrived to
drop some words into his ear. Aramis, notwithstanding his self-control,
could not refrain from a slight movement of surprise.
NA
leaving Aramis he went to talk with Madame de Chevreuse, who was in the
midst of a large group.
Aramis affected a laugh, to divert the attention of certain curious
listeners, and perceiving that Athos had betaken himself to the
embrasure of a window and remained there, he proceeded to join him,
throwing out a few words carelessly as he moved through the room.
As soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was
emphasized by frequent gesticulation.
Raoul then approached them as Athos had directed him to do.
â€œâ€˜Tis a rondeau by Monsieur Voiture that monsieur lâ€™abbe is repeating to

NA
Raoul stayed only a few minutes near them and then mingled with the
group round Madame de Chevreuse.

Some one drew near.

Raoul looked surprised and his eyes met those of the young lady, who
smiled.
The company went on speaking of the poet Voiture.

Scarron and Raoul laughed. The fair Indian, astonished at the sensation

They parted, laughing, she turning back to gaze at the poor paralytic
man with interest, he looking after her with eyes of love.
One by one the several groups broke up. Scarron seemed not to observe
that certain of his guests had talked mysteriously, that letters had
passed from hand to hand and that the assembly had seemed to have a
secret purpose quite apart from the literary discussion carried on with
so much ostentation. What was all that to Scarron? At his house

As to Raoul, he had attended the duchess to her carriage, where, as she

So the invalid disappeared soon afterward and went into his

22. Saint Denis.
The day had begun to break when Athos arose and dressed himself. It was
plain, by a paleness still greater than usual, and by those traces which
loss of sleep leaves on the face, that he must have passed almost the
whole of the night without sleeping. Contrary to the custom of a man so
firm and decided, there was this morning in his personal appearance
something tardy and irresolute.
He was occupied with the preparations for Raoulâ€™s departure and was
seeking to gain time. In the first place he himself furbished a sword,
which he drew from its perfumed leather sheath; he examined it to see if
its hilt was well guarded and if the blade was firmly attached to the
hilt. Then he placed at the bottom of the valise belonging to the young
man a small bag of louis, called Olivain, the lackey who had followed
him from Blois, and made him pack the valise under his own eyes,
watchful to see that everything should be put in which might be useful
to a young man entering on his first campaign.
At length, after occupying about an hour in these preparations, he
opened the door of the room in which the vicomte slept, and entered.
The sun, already high, penetrated into the room through the window, the
curtains of which Raoul had neglected to close on the previous evening.
He was still sleeping, his head gracefully reposing on his arm.
Athos approached and hung over the youth in an attitude full of tender
melancholy; he looked long on this young man, whose smiling mouth and
half closed eyes bespoke soft dreams and lightest slumber, as if his
guardian angel watched over him with solicitude and affection. By
degrees Athos gave himself up to the charms of his reverie in the
proximity of youth, so pure, so fresh. His own youth seemed to reappear,
bringing with it all those savoury remembrances, which are like perfumes
more than thoughts. Between the past and the present was an ineffable
abyss. But imagination has the wings of an angel of light and travels
safely through or over the seas where we have been almost shipwrecked,
the darkness in which our illusions are lost, the precipice whence our
happiness has been hurled and swallowed up. He remembered that all the
first part of his life had been embittered by a woman and he thought
with alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine, and at the
same time so vigorous an organization as that of Raoul.
In recalling all he had been through, he foresaw all that Raoul might
suffer; and the expression of the deep and tender compassion which
throbbed in his heart was pictured in the moist eye with which he gazed
on the young man.
At this moment Raoul awoke, without a cloud on his face without
weariness or lassitude; his eyes were fixed on those of Athos and
perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was
awaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress,
for his glance, in return, had all the tenderness of love.
NA
NA
NA
â€œI wished to leave you still to enjoy some moments of sleep, my child;
NA
NA
Athos smiled.
NA
NA
NA
paternal interest felt by a grown man for a youth.
NA
NA
Athos then called Olivain.
NA
NA
NA
to attend to all these details. Truly, sir, you overwhelm me with
NA
NA
emotion.
NA
NA
that he might hide his emotion.
NA
The servant then approached Athos and said, hesitatingly:
NA
NA
They went downstairs, Raoul looking every now and then at the count to
see if the moment of farewell was at hand, but Athos was silent. When
they reached the steps Raoul saw three horses.
NA
NA
Joy shone in Raoulâ€™s eyes and he leaped lightly to his saddle.
Athos mounted more slowly, after speaking in a low voice to the lackey,
who, instead of following them immediately, returned to their rooms.
Raoul, delighted at the countâ€™s companionship, perceived, or affected to
perceive nothing of this byplay.
They set out, passing over the Pont Neuf; they pursued their way along
the quay then called Lâ€™Abreuvoir Pepin, and went along by the walls of
the Grand Chatelet. They proceeded to the Rue Saint Denis.
After passing through the Porte Saint Denis, Athos looked at Raoulâ€™s way
of riding and observed:
â€œTake care, Raoul! I have already often told you of this; you must not
forget it, for it is a great defect in a rider. See! your horse is tired
already, he froths at the mouth, whilst mine looks as if he had only
just left the stable. You hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth
hard, so that you will not be able to make him manoeuvre quickly. The
safety of a cavalier often depends on the prompt obedience of his horse.
In a week, remember, you will no longer be performing your manoeuvres
NA
Then suddenly, in order not to give too uncomfortable an importance to
this observation:
NA
The young man stored in his mind the admonition whilst he admired the
delicate tenderness with which it was bestowed.
NA
firing off your pistol you hold your arm too far outstretched. This
tension lessens the accuracy of the aim. So in twelve times you thrice

NA
â€œBecause I bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbow--so; do you

â€œYes, sir. I have fired since in that manner and have been quite

NA
fire--and you will do so, for you are recommended to a young general who
is very fond of powder--remember that in single combat, which often
takes place in the cavalry, never to fire the first shot. He who fires
the first shot rarely hits his man, for he fires with the apprehension
of being disarmed, before an armed foe; then, whilst he fires, make your
NA
NA
NA
yonder? They are. Then another important thing, Raoul: should you be
wounded in a battle, and fall from your horse, if you have any strength
left, disentangle yourself from the line that your regiment has formed;
otherwise, it may be driven back and you will be trampled to death by
the horses. At all events, should you be wounded, write to me that very
instant, or get some one at once to write to me. We are judges of

NA
They arrived that very moment at the gate of the town, guarded by two
sentinels.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Raoul.
â€œFaith, yes, with a haughty presence, a fine equipage; such as the son
NA
NA
NA
Thus talking, they traversed the streets, full of people on account of
the fete, and arrived opposite the old cathedral, where first mass was
going on.
NA
NA
The two gentlemen then went into the church. Athos gave Raoul some of
the holy water. A love as tender as that of a lover for his mistress
dwells, undoubtedly, in some paternal hearts toward a son.
Athos said a word to one of the vergers, who bowed and proceeded toward
the basement.
NA
The verger opened the iron grating that guarded the royal tombs and
stood on the topmost step, whilst Athos and Raoul descended. The
sepulchral depths of the descent were dimly lighted by a silver lamp on
the lowest step; and just below this lamp there was laid, wrapped in a
flowing mantle of violet velvet, worked with fleurs-de-lis of gold, a
catafalque resting on trestles of oak. The young man, prepared for this
scene by the state of his own feelings, which were mournful, and by the
majesty of the cathedral which he had passed through, descended in a
slow and solemn manner and stood with head uncovered before these mortal
spoils of the last king, who was not to be placed by the side of his
forefathers until his successor should take his place there; and who
appeared to abide on that spot, that he might thus address human pride,
so sure to be exalted by the glories of a throne: â€œDust of the earth!
NA
There was profound silence.
Then Athos raised his hand and pointing to the coffin:
NA
mind, yet one whose reign was full of great events; because over this
king watched the spirit of another man, even as this lamp keeps vigil
over this coffin and illumines it. He whose intellect was thus supreme,
Raoul, was the actual sovereign; the other, nothing but a phantom to
whom he lent a soul; and yet, so powerful is majesty amongst us, this
man has not even the honor of a tomb at the feet of him in whose service
his life was worn away. Remember, Raoul, this! If Richelieu made the
king, by comparison, seem small, he made royalty great. The Palace of
the Louvre contains two things--the king, who must die, and royalty,
which never dies. The minister, so feared, so hated by his master, has
descended into the tomb, drawing after him the king, whom he would not
leave alone on earth, lest his work should be destroyed. So blind were
his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinalâ€™s death as a
deliverance; and I, even I, opposed the designs of the great man who
held the destinies of France within the hollow of his hand. Raoul, learn
how to distinguish the king from royalty; the king is but a man; royalty
is the gift of God. Whenever you hesitate as to whom you ought to serve,
abandon the exterior, the material appearance for the invisible
principle, for the invisible principle is everything. Raoul, I seem to
read your future destiny as through a cloud. It will be happier, I
think, than ours has been. Different in your fate from us, you will have
a king without a minister, whom you may serve, love, respect. Should the
king prove a tyrant, for power begets tyranny, serve, love, respect
royalty, that Divine right, that celestial spark which makes this dust
still powerful and holy, so that we--gentlemen, nevertheless, of rank
and condition--are as nothing in comparison with the cold corpse there
NA
NA
the king. And if death be my lot, I hope to die for the king, for
NA
Athos smiled.
NA
Raoul bent his knee to the ground.
â€œIt was worn by my father, a loyal gentleman. I have worn it in my turn
and it has sometimes not been disgraced when the hilt was in my hand and
the sheath at my side. Should your hand still be too weak to use this
sword, Raoul, so much the better. You will have the more time to learn
NA
NA
from the count, â€œI owe you everything and yet this sword is the most
precious gift you have yet made me. I will wear it, I swear to you, as a

NA
Raoul arose and threw himself with emotion into the countâ€™s arms.
NA
NA
NA
should any harm befall me, your name will be the last name that I shall
NA
Athos hastened upstairs to conceal his emotion, and regained with
hurried steps the porch where Olivain was waiting with the horses.
NA
â€œtighten the buckle of the sword, it falls too low. You will accompany
monsieur le vicomte till Grimaud rejoins you. You know, Raoul, Grimaud
NA
NA
NA
Raoul obeyed.
NA
NA
Athos waved his hand--he dared not trust himself to speak: and Raoul
went away, his head uncovered. Athos remained motionless, looking after
him until he turned the corner of the street.
Then the count threw the bridle of his horse into the hands of a
peasant, remounted the steps, went into the cathedral, there to kneel
down in the darkest corner and pray.
23. One of the Forty Methods of Escape of the Duc de Beaufort.
Meanwhile time was passing on for the prisoner, as well as for those who
were preparing his escape; only for him it passed more slowly. Unlike
other men, who enter with ardor upon a perilous resolution and grow cold
as the moment of execution approaches, the Duc de Beaufort, whose
buoyant courage had become a proverb, seemed to push time before him and
sought most eagerly to hasten the hour of action. In his escape alone,
apart from his plans for the future, which, it must be admitted, were
for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain, there was a beginning
of vengeance which filled his heart. In the first place his escape would
be a serious misfortune to Monsieur de Chavigny, whom he hated for the
petty persecutions he owed to him. It would be a still worse affair for
Mazarin, whom he execrated for the greater offences he had committed. It
may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments
toward the governor of the prison and the minister--toward the
subordinate and the master.
Then Monsieur de Beaufort, who was so familiar with the interior of the
Palais Royal, though he did not know the relations existing between the
queen and the cardinal, pictured to himself, in his prison, all that
dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the
ministerâ€™s cabinet to the chamber of Anne of Austria: â€œMonsieur de
NA
Beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside,
breathing the air of the plains and the forests, pressing a strong horse
NA
It is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within
four walls; he saw La Ramee twirling his thumbs ten feet from him, and
his guards laughing and drinking in the ante-chamber. The only thing
that was pleasant to him in that odious tableau--such is the instability
of the human mind--was the sullen face of Grimaud, for whom he had at
first conceived such a hatred and who now was all his hope. Grimaud
seemed to him an Antinous. It is needless to say that this
transformation was visible only to the prisonerâ€™s feverish imagination.
Grimaud was still the same, and therefore he retained the entire
confidence of his superior, La Ramee, who now relied upon him more than
he did upon himself, for, as we have said, La Ramee felt at the bottom
of his heart a certain weakness for Monsieur de Beaufort.
And so the good La Ramee made a festivity of the little supper with his
prisoner. He had but one fault--he was a gourmand; he had found the
pates good, the wine excellent. Now the successor of Pere Marteau had
promised him a pate of pheasant instead of a pate of fowl, and
Chambertin wine instead of Macon. All this, set off by the presence of
that excellent prince, who was so good-natured, who invented so droll
tricks against Monsieur de Chavigny and so fine jokes against Mazarin,
made for La Ramee the approaching Pentecost one of the four great feasts
of the year. He therefore looked forward to six oâ€™clock with as much
impatience as the duke himself.
Since daybreak La Ramee had been occupied with the preparations, and
trusting no one but himself, he had visited personally the successor of
Pere Marteau. The latter had surpassed himself; he showed La Ramee a
monstrous pate, ornamented with Monsieur de Beaufortâ€™s coat-of-arms. It
was empty as yet, but a pheasant and two partridges were lying near it.
La Rameeâ€™s mouth watered and he returned to the dukeâ€™s chamber rubbing
his hands. To crown his happiness, Monsieur de Chavigny had started on a
journey that morning and in his absence La Ramee was deputy-governor of
the chateau.
As for Grimaud, he seemed more sullen than ever.
In the course of the forenoon Monsieur de Beaufort had a game of tennis
with La Ramee; a sign from Grimaud put him on the alert. Grimaud, going
in advance, followed the course which they were to take in the evening.
The game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the
chateau, a place quite deserted except when Monsieur de Beaufort was
playing; and even then the precaution seemed superfluous, the wall was
so high.
There were three gates to open before reaching the inclosure, each by a
different key. When they arrived Grimaud went carelessly and sat down by
a loophole in the wall, letting his legs dangle outside. It was evident
that there the rope ladder was to be attached.
This manoeuvre, transparent to the Duc de Beaufort, was quite
unintelligible to La Ramee.
The game at tennis, which, upon a sign from Grimaud, Monsieur de
Beaufort had consented to play, began in the afternoon. The duke was in
full strength and beat La Ramee completely.
Four of the guards, who were constantly near the prisoner, assisted in
picking up the tennis balls. When the game was over, the duke, laughing
at La Ramee for his bad play, offered these men two louis dâ€™or to go and
drink his health, with their four other comrades.
The guards asked permission of La Ramee, who gave it to them, but not
till the evening, however; until then he had business and the prisoner
was not to be left alone.
Six oâ€™clock came and, although they were not to sit down to table until
seven oâ€™clock, dinner was ready and served up. Upon a sideboard appeared
the colossal pie with the dukeâ€™s arms on it, and seemingly cooked to a
turn, as far as one could judge by the golden color which illuminated
the crust.
The rest of the dinner was to come.
Every one was impatient, La Ramee to sit down to table, the guards to go
and drink, the duke to escape.
Grimaud alone was calm as ever. One might have fancied that Athos had
educated him with the express forethought of such a great event.
There were moments when, looking at Grimaud, the duke asked himself if
he was not dreaming and if that marble figure was really at his service
and would grow animated when the moment came for action.
La Ramee sent away the guards, desiring them to drink to the dukeâ€™s
health, and as soon as they were gone shut all the doors, put the keys
in his pocket and showed the table to the prince with an air that
signified:
NA
The prince looked at Grimaud, Grimaud looked at the clock; it was hardly
a quarter-past six. The escape was fixed to take place at seven oâ€™clock;
there was therefore three-quarters of an hour to wait.
The duke, in order to pass away another quarter of an hour, pretended to
be reading something that interested him and muttered that he wished
they would allow him to finish his chapter. La Ramee went up to him and
looked over his shoulder to see what sort of a book it was that had so
singular an influence over the prisoner as to make him put off taking
his dinner.
NA
the orders of the governor; and La Ramee resolved never again to disobey
these injunctions.
Meantime he uncorked the bottles and went to smell if the pie was good.
At half-past six the duke arose and said very gravely:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
laugh.
The duke vouchsafed no reply, but sitting down at the table made a sign
that La Ramee should seat himself opposite. There is nothing so
expressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself before a well
spread table, so La Ramee, when receiving his plate of soup from
Grimaud, presented a type of perfect bliss.
The duke smiled.
NA
NA
NA
pleasanter sight on earth than a well covered table; and when, added to
that, he who does the honors is the grandson of Henry IV., you will, my
lord duke, easily comprehend that the honor fairly doubles the pleasure
NA
The duke, in his turn, bowed, and an imperceptible smile appeared on the
face of Grimaud, who kept behind La Ramee.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œTo own the truth, I should be inconsolable if you were to leave
NA
NA
NA
NA
Every folly you committed would embroil you with the court and they
would put you into the Bastile, instead of Vincennes. Now, Monsieur de
Chavigny is not amiable, I allow, but Monsieur du Tremblay is

NA
the fingers of which seemed to move with sickening slowness.
â€œBut what can you expect from the brother of a capuchin monk, brought up
in the school of Cardinal Richelieu? Ah, my lord, it is a great
happiness that the queen, who always wished you well, had a fancy to
send you here, where thereâ€™s a promenade and a tennis court, good air,

raising his glass of Madeira to his lips, and winking his eye that he
might see the sun through the rich liquid that he was about to taste.
The duke glanced at the clock. In ten minutes it would strike seven.
Grimaud placed the pie before the duke, who took a knife with a silver
blade to raise the upper crust; but La Ramee, who was afraid of any harm
happening to this fine work of art, passed his knife, which had an iron
blade, to the duke.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, I should hope, in the first instance, to have for keeper an

the dukeâ€™s words.
â€œYes; see, I send a ball into the moat; a man is there who picks it up;
the ball contains a letter. Instead of returning the ball to me when I
call for it from the top of the wall, he throws me another; that other
ball contains a letter. Thus we have exchanged ideas and no one has seen

The duke smiled.

attractive than those of Pere Marteau and proposes to me that I shall
try them. I consent on condition that La Ramee tries them with me. That
we may be more at our ease, La Ramee removes the guards, keeping only
Grimaud to wait on us. Grimaud is the man whom a friend has sent to

ladder of rope, and a gag. I point one of the poniards at La Rameeâ€™s
breast and I say to him, â€˜My friend, I am sorry for it, but if thou
NA
The duke, in pronouncing these words, suited, as we have said, the
action to the words. He was standing near the officer and he directed
the point of the poniard in such a manner, close to La Rameeâ€™s heart,
that there could be no doubt in the mind of that individual as to his
determination. Meanwhile, Grimaud, still mute as ever, drew from the pie
the other poniard, the rope ladder and the gag.
La Ramee followed all these objects with his eyes, his alarm every
moment increasing.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
At this moment the clock struck.
NA
La Ramee made one movement, in order to satisfy his conscience. The duke
frowned, the officer felt the point of the poniard, which, having
penetrated through his clothes, was close to his heart.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The duke undid his belt and gave it to Grimaud, who tied La Ramee in
such a way as to satisfy him.
NA
La Ramee stretched out his legs, Grimaud took a table-cloth, tore it
into strips and tied La Rameeâ€™s feet together.
NA
ask for it; without it I should be tried in a court of justice because I
did not raise the alarm. Thrust it into my mouth, my lord, thrust it
NA
Grimaud prepared to comply with this request, when the officer made a
sign as if he had something to say.
NA
â€œNow, my lord, do not forget, if any harm happens to me on your account,
NA
NA
In a second La Ramee was gagged and laid prostrate. Two or three chairs
were thrown down as if there had been a struggle. Grimaud then took from
the pocket of the officer all the keys it contained and first opened the
door of the room in which they were, then shut it and double-locked it,
and both he and the duke proceeded rapidly down the gallery which led to
the little inclosure. At last they reached the tennis court. It was
completely deserted. No sentinels, no one at any of the windows. The
duke ran to the rampart and perceived on the other side of the ditch,
three cavaliers with two riding horses. The duke exchanged a signal with
them. It was indeed for him that they were there.
Grimaud, meantime, undid the means of escape.
This was not, however, a rope ladder, but a ball of silk cord, with a
narrow board which was to pass between the legs, the ball to unwind
itself by the weight of the person who sat astride upon the board.
NA
NA
â€œCertainly. If I am caught, I risk nothing but being taken back again to
NA
NA
And instantly, Grimaud, sitting upon the board as if on horseback,
commenced his perilous descent.
The duke followed him with his eyes, with involuntary terror. He had
gone down about three-quarters of the length of the wall when the cord
broke. Grimaud fell--precipitated into the moat.
The duke uttered a cry, but Grimaud did not give a single moan. He must
have been dreadfully hurt, for he did not stir from the place where he
fell.
Immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat,
tied under Grimaudâ€™s shoulders the end of a cord, and the remaining two,
who held the other end, drew Grimaud to them.
NA
NA
The duke had already begun to descend. His task was the more difficult,
as there was no board to support him. He was obliged to let himself down
by his hands and from a height of fifty feet. But as we have said he was
active, strong, and full of presence of mind. In less than five minutes
he arrived at the end of the cord. He was then only fifteen feet from
the ground, as the gentlemen below had told him. He let go the rope and
fell upon his feet, without receiving any injury.
He instantly began to climb up the slope of the moat, on the top of
which he met De Rochefort. The other two gentlemen were unknown to him.
Grimaud, in a swoon, was tied securely to a horse.
NA
NA
And he jumped on his horse and set off at full gallop, snuffing the
fresh air in his triumph and shouting out, with an expression of face
which it would be impossible to describe:

24. The timely Arrival of Dâ€™Artagnan in Paris.
At Blois, Dâ€™Artagnan received the money paid to him by Mazarin for any
future service he might render the cardinal.
From Blois to Paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers,
but Dâ€™Artagnan arrived on the third day at the Barriere Saint Denis. In
turning the corner of the Rue Montmartre, in order to reach the Rue
Tiquetonne and the Hotel de la Chevrette, where he had appointed Porthos
to meet him, he saw at one of the windows of the hotel, that friend
himself dressed in a sky-blue waistcoat, embroidered with silver, and
gaping, till he showed every one of his white teeth; whilst the people
passing by admiringly gazed at this gentleman, so handsome and so rich,
who seemed to weary of his riches and his greatness.
Dâ€™Artagnan and Planchet had hardly turned the corner when Porthos
recognized them.
NA
NA
Porthos came down at once to the threshold of the hotel.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
added, with his air of vulgar self-complacency, â€œwho is very agreeable
NA
The pretty Madeleine, who had approached during this colloquy, stepped
back and turned pale as death on hearing Porthosâ€™s words, for she
thought the scene with the Swiss was about to be repeated. But to her
great surprise Dâ€™Artagnan remained perfectly calm, and instead of being
angry he laughed, and said to Porthos:
â€œYes, I understand, the air of La Rue Tiquetonne is not like that of
Pierrefonds; but console yourself, I will soon conduct you to one much

NA
NA
NA
To that exclamation of Porthosâ€™s succeeded a groaning, low and profound,
which seemed to come from behind a door. Dâ€™Artagnan, who had just
dismounted, then saw, outlined against the wall, the enormous stomach of
Mousqueton, whose down-drawn mouth emitted sounds of distress.
â€œAnd you, too, my poor Monsieur Mouston, are out of place in this poor

under arms.

They set out on Vulcan and Bayard, followed by Mousqueton on Phoebus,
and arrived at the Palais Royal at about a quarter to seven. The streets
were crowded, for it was the day of Pentecost, and the crowd looked in
wonder at these two cavaliers; one as fresh as if he had come out of a
bandbox, the other so covered with dust that he looked as if he had but
just come off a field of battle.
Mousqueton also attracted attention; and as the romance of Don Quixote
was then the fashion, they said that he was Sancho, who, after having
lost one master, had found two.
On reaching the palace, Dâ€™Artagnan sent to his eminence the letter in
which he had been ordered to return without delay. He was soon ordered
to the presence of the cardinal.

NA
Mazarin was in his study, working at a list of pensions and benefices,
of which he was trying to reduce the number. He saw Dâ€™Artagnan and
Porthos enter with internal pleasure, yet showed no joy in his
countenance.
â€œAh! you, is it? Monsieur le lieutenant, you have been very prompt. â€˜Tis

â€œThanks, my lord. Here I am at your eminenceâ€™s service, as well as
Monsieur du Vallon, one of my old friends, who used to conceal his

Porthos bowed to the cardinal.
NA
Porthos turned his head to the right and to the left, and drew himself
up with a movement full of dignity.
NA
Porthos bowed to his friend.
Mazarin was as fond of fine soldiers as, in later times, Frederick of
Prussia used to be. He admired the strong hands, the broad shoulders and
the steady eye of Porthos. He seemed to see before him the salvation of
his administration and of the kingdom, sculptured in flesh and bone. He
remembered that the old association of musketeers was composed of four
persons.
NA
Porthos opened his mouth, thinking it a good opportunity to put in a
word in his turn; Dâ€™Artagnan checked him by a glance from the corner of
his eye.
NA
Mazarin coughed a little.
NA
he asked.
â€œYes, my lord, and from pure devotion to the cause, for Monsieur de

These were the first words he had spoken.

Dâ€™Artagnan bowed.

In fact, a great noise was heard in the ante-chamber; at the same time
the door of the study was burst open and a man, covered with dust,
rushed into it, exclaiming:

Mazarin thought that some one was going to assassinate him and he drew
back, pushing his chair on the castors. Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos moved so
as to plant themselves between the person entering and the cardinal.

Mazarin, perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that
he had something of importance to say, made a sign that Dâ€™Artagnan and
Porthos should give place.
Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos withdrew to a corner of the cabinet.

â€œThe matter is, my lord, that the Duc de Beaufort has contrived to

NA
NA
They descended the great staircase, taking with them all the guards they
NA
put spur to horse, which set off along the Rue Saint Honore with the
speed of the whirlwind.
NA
NA
As they went, the citizens, awakened, left their doors and the street
dogs followed the cavaliers, barking. At the corner of the Cimetiere
Saint Jean, Dâ€™Artagnan upset a man; it was too insignificant an
occurrence to delay people so eager to get on. The troop continued its
course as though their steeds had wings.
Alas! there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see
that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the monarchy.
25. An Adventure on the High Road.
The musketeers rode the whole length of the Faubourg Saint Antoine and
of the road to Vincennes, and soon found themselves out of the town,
then in a forest and then within sight of a village.
The horses seemed to become more lively with each successive step; their
nostrils reddened like glowing furnaces. Dâ€™Artagnan, freely applying his
spurs, was in advance of Porthos two feet at the most; Mousqueton
followed two lengths behind; the guards were scattered according to the
varying excellence of their respective mounts.
From the top of an eminence Dâ€™Artagnan perceived a group of people
collected on the other side of the moat, in front of that part of the
donjon which looks toward Saint Maur. He rode on, convinced that in this
direction he would gain intelligence of the fugitive. In five minutes he
had arrived at the place, where the guards joined him, coming up one by
one.
The several members of that group were much excited. They looked at the
cord, still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twenty feet
from the ground. Their eyes measured the height and they exchanged
conjectures. On the top of the wall sentinels went and came with a
frightened air.
A few soldiers, commanded by a sergeant, drove away idlers from the
place where the duke had mounted his horse. Dâ€™Artagnan went straight to
the sergeant.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
A joyous smile lighted Porthosâ€™s face.
NA
NA
â€œTwo hours and a quarter--that is nothing; we are well mounted, are we
NA
Porthos breathed a sigh; he thought of what was in store for his poor
horses.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Anger mounted to Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s face; he frowned and his cheeks were
colored.
NA
NA
He unfolded the paper, presented it to the sergeant with one hand and
with the other took a pistol from his holsters and cocked it.
â€œOrder of the king, I tell you. Read and answer, or I will blow out your

NA
he replied.

Dâ€™Artagnan shrugged his shoulders, made a sign to his escort and
started.
NA
the gate that had been pointed out.
But, now that the duke had escaped, the concierge had seen fit to fasten
the gate with a double lock. It was necessary to compel him to open it,
as the sergeant had been compelled to speak, and this took another ten
minutes. This last obstacle having been overcome, the troop pursued
their course with their accustomed ardor; but some of the horses could
no longer sustain this pace; three of them stopped after an hourâ€™s
gallop, and one fell down.
Dâ€™Artagnan, who never turned his head, did not perceive it. Porthos told
him of it in his calm manner.
NA
NA
NA
And he spurred his courser on.
At the end of another two hours the horses had gone twelve leagues
without stopping; their legs began to tremble, and the foam they shed
whitened the doublets of their masters.
â€œLet us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathing
NA
NA
fresh tracks; â€˜tis not a quarter of an hour since they passed this
NA
In fact, the road was trodden by horsesâ€™ feet, visible even in the
approaching gloom of evening.
They set out; after a run of two leagues, Mousquetonâ€™s horse sank.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
But at last the lieutenantâ€™s horse refused to go on; he could not
breathe; one last spur, instead of making him advance, made him fall.

NA
In fact, at that moment a second neighing was borne to them on the night
wind.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
They went on through the darkness, silent as phantoms; they saw a light
glimmering in the midst of some trees.
NA
NA
They glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty steps from the
house unperceived and saw by means of a lantern suspended under a hut,
four fine horses. A groom was rubbing them down; near them were saddles
and bridles.
Dâ€™Artagnan approached quickly, making a sign to his two companions to
remain a few steps behind.
NA
The groom turned toward him with a look of surprise, but made no reply.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
And he took hold of one within his reach; his two companions did the
same thing.
NA
NA
NA
The groom cried aloud for help. A kind of steward appeared, just as
Dâ€™Artagnan and his companions were prepared to mount. The steward
attempted to expostulate.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAnd I, mine; Iâ€™ve ten guards behind me, donâ€™t you hear them gallop? and

They all mounted the horses as quickly as possible.
NA
NA
NA
They all set off, swift as the wind.

building.
NA
NA
A gleam, like a flash of lightning, illumined the road, and with the
flash was heard the whistling of balls, which were fired wildly in the
air.
NA
people fired better than that, do you remember the road to Crevecoeur,
NA
NA
NA
â€œEgad, didnâ€™t you hear? these horses belong to Monsieur de Montbazon;
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
said Dâ€™Artagnan, with a look as if he spoke against his conviction.
NA
They rode on for an hour, till the horses were covered with foam and
dust.

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
And they darted on anew. The horses, excited by pain and emulation,
raced over the dark road, in the midst of which was now seen a moving
mass, denser and more obscure than the rest of the horizon.
26. The Rencontre.
They rode on in this way for ten minutes. Suddenly two dark forms seemed
to separate from the mass, advanced, grew in size, and as they loomed up
larger and larger, assumed the appearance of two horsemen.
NA
NA
NA
The three horsemen made no reply, stopped not, and all that was heard
was the noise of swords drawn from the scabbards and the cocking of the
pistols with which the two phantoms were armed.
NA
Porthos understood him and he and the lieutenant each drew with the left
hand a pistol from their bolsters and cocked it in their turn.
NA
NA
NA
as a horse chews his bit. â€œStuff and nonsense; we have seen plenty of
NA
Hearing these words, the two shadows blockaded the road and by the light
of the stars might be seen the shining of their arms.
NA
Two shots were the reply to this threat; but the assailants attacked
their foes with such velocity that in a moment they were upon them; a
third pistol-shot was heard, aimed by Dâ€™Artagnan, and one of his
adversaries fell. As for Porthos, he assaulted the foe with such
violence that, although his sword was thrust aside, the enemy was thrown
off his horse and fell about ten steps from it.
NA
beside his friend, who had already begun a fresh pursuit.
NA
NA
NA
Another shot of a carbine was heard. It was Mousqueton, who was obeying
his masterâ€™s command.
NA
NA
And in fact, two other cavaliers made their appearance, detached, as it
seemed, from the principal group; they again disputed the road.
This time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak.
NA
NA
NA
A burst of laughter was the answer, but finished with a groan.
Dâ€™Artagnan had, with his sword, cut in two the poor wretch who had
laughed.
At the same time Porthos and his adversary fired on each other and
Dâ€™Artagnan turned to him.
NA
NA
â€œWhat would you have, my dear fellow? One doesnâ€™t hit the bullâ€™s-eye
every time; it is something to hit inside the ring. Ho! parbleau! what
NA
NA
In truth, the lieutenantâ€™s horse stumbled and fell on his knees; then a
rattling in his throat was heard and he lay down to die. He had received
in the chest the bullet of Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s first adversary. Dâ€™Artagnan
swore loud enough to be heard in the skies.
NA
NA
NA
NA

â€œTheir masters are dead! I thought they might be useful, so I took

Meantime Porthos had reloaded his pistols.
NA
As he spoke, two horsemen advanced at full speed.
NA
NA
NA
A shot was fired that moment; Mousqueton shrieked with pain.
â€œAh, sir! Iâ€™m hit in the other side! exactly opposite the other! This
NA
Porthos turned around like a lion, plunged on the dismounted cavalier,
who tried to draw his sword; but before it was out of the scabbard,
Porthos, with the hilt of his had struck him such a terrible blow on the
head that he fell like an ox beneath the butcherâ€™s knife.
Mousqueton, groaning, slipped from his horse, his wound not allowing him
to keep the saddle.
On perceiving the cavaliers, Dâ€™Artagnan had stopped and charged his
pistol afresh; besides, his horse, he found, had a carbine on the bow of
the saddle.
NA
NA
NA
They spurred on their horses; the other cavaliers were only twenty steps
from them.
NA
NA
proceed from a cloud, so enveloped was the cavalier in a whirlwind of
dust.
â€œâ€˜Tis well, we will see if the kingâ€™s name is not a passport
NA
NA
Two shots were fired at once, one by Dâ€™Artagnan, the other by the
adversary of Porthos. Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s ball took off his enemyâ€™s hat. The
ball fired by Porthosâ€™s foe went through the throat of his horse, which
fell, groaning.
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan then saw a musket-barrel leveled at him; he had no time to
draw from his holsters. He recalled a bit of advice which Athos had once
given him, and made his horse rear.
The ball struck the animal full in front. Dâ€™Artagnan felt his horse
giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one
side.
NA
jeering, â€œthis is nothing but a butchery of horses and not a combat
NA
And he jumped off his horse.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan, in two steps, was engaged with the foe, whom, according to
custom, he attacked impetuously, but he met this time with a skill and a
strength of arm that gave him pause. Twice he was obliged to step back;
his opponent stirred not one inch. Dâ€™Artagnan returned and again
attacked him.
Twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides, without effect;
sparks were emitted from the swords like water spouting forth.
At last Dâ€™Artagnan thought it was time to try one of his favorite feints
in fencing. He brought it to bear, skillfully executed it with the
rapidity of lightning, and struck the blow with a force which he fancied
would prove irresistible.
The blow was parried.
NA
At this exclamation his adversary bounded back and, bending his bare
head, tried to distinguish in the gloom the features of the lieutenant.
As to Dâ€™Artagnan, afraid of some feint, he still stood on the defensive.
NA
NA
NA
Porthos fired; the flash threw a gleam of light over the field of
battle.
As the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two
combatants.
NA
NA
Athos raised his sword; Dâ€™Artagnan lowered his.
NA
NA
And he threw away his pistol.
Aramis pushed his back into his saddle-bags and sheathed his sword.
NA
This was the name which he gave him in former days, in their moments of
tender intimacy.
NA
I, who have sworn to take him dead or alive, I am dishonored--and by

NA
NA
NA
in the world who could stay my hand; by a fatality that very man bars my

command in the battle-field, â€œthat he sent against me the only two men
capable of getting the better of four men; of fighting man to man,
without discomfiture, against the Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier
dâ€™Herblay, and of surrendering only to fifty men!
NA
as they addressed the Duc de Beaufort, whilst Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos
stepped backward.
NA
NA
The two friends looked to the right, to the left; they were encompassed
by a troop of horsemen.
NA
about twenty men with you, so I came back with those around me, tired of
always running away, and wishing to draw my sword in my own cause; but

Some of the men moved toward them.

NA
NA
NA
The order was obeyed; Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos then found themselves in
the centre of a large circle.
NA
Aramis dismounted and went to Porthos, whilst Athos approached
Dâ€™Artagnan.
All four once more together.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
gentlemen such as these. â€˜Tis a matter of conscience with them, as with

Dâ€™Artagnan only sighed.
Athos looked at them both and took their hands in his.

the great, the distressing truth! But we have not as yet declared war;
perhaps we shall have to make certain conditions, therefore a solemn

Athos and Aramis looked at each other.

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan recognized the voice of De Rochefort.
NA
NA
â€œThat shall be testified to, rest assured. Adieu! we shall meet soon, I
NA
spoke, kissed his hand, spurred his horse into a gallop and disappeared,
followed by his troop, who were soon lost in distance and darkness.
Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles
two horses; they thought it was Mousqueton and went up to him.
NA
Grimaud signified that he was not mistaken.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
They were taking the road toward Paris, when groans, which seemed to
proceed from a ditch, attracted their attention.
NA
NA
arose out of the side of the road.
NA
he said.
NA
NA
NA
his old comrade, whose eyes were full of tears, nor could Grimaud tell
whether the tears were caused by wounds or by the pleasure of seeing him
again.
Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos went on, meantime, to Paris. They were passed by
a sort of courier, covered with dust, the bearer of a letter from the
duke to the cardinal, giving testimony to the valor of Dâ€™Artagnan and
Porthos.
Mazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was brought to him,
announcing that the duke was free and that he would henceforth raise up
mortal strife against him.
NA
that, at least, in this chase, Dâ€™Artagnan has done me one good turn--he
has destroyed Broussel. This Gascon is a precious fellow; even his

The cardinal referred to that man whom Dâ€™Artagnan upset at the corner of
the Cimetiere Saint Jean in Paris, and who was no other than the
Councillor Broussel.
27. The four old Friends prepare to meet again.
NA
Chevrette, to Dâ€™Artagnan, who, with a long and melancholy face, had
returned from the Palais Royal; â€œdid he receive you ungraciously, my
NA
â€œIâ€™faith, yes! a brute, that cardinal. What are you eating there,
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œZounds! you know thereâ€™s only one way of saying things, so I went in
and said, â€˜My lord, we were not the strongest party.â€™
â€œâ€˜Yes, I know that,â€™ he said, â€˜but give me the particulars.â€™
â€œYou know, Porthos, I could not give him the particulars without naming
our friends; to name them would be to commit them to ruin, so I merely
said they were fifty and we were two.
â€œâ€˜There was firing, nevertheless, I heard,â€™ he said; â€˜and your
swords--they saw the light of day, I presume?â€™
â€œâ€˜That is, the night, my lord,â€™ I answered.
â€œâ€˜Ah!â€™ cried the cardinal, â€˜I thought you were a Gascon, my friend?â€™
â€œâ€˜I am a Gascon,â€™ said I, â€˜only when I succeed.â€™ The answer pleased him
and he laughed.
â€œâ€˜That will teach me,â€™ he said, â€˜to have my guards provided with better
horses; for if they had been able to keep up with you and if each one of
them had done as much as you and your friend, you would have kept your

NA
â€œOh, mon Dieu! no, nothing at all. It was the way in which he spoke. It
is incredible how these biscuit soak up wine! They are veritable

The bottle was brought with a promptness which showed the degree of
consideration Dâ€™Artagnan enjoyed in the establishment. He continued:
â€œSo I was going away, but he called me back.
â€œâ€˜You have had three horses foundered or killed?â€™ he asked me.
â€œâ€˜Yes, my lord.â€™
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œFaith! he was very much inclined to do so, the contemptible fellow. He
made a great start and looked at me. I also looked at him; then he
understood, and putting his hand into a drawer, he took from it a

â€œWhat! that little man in black that you upset at the corner of Saint

â€œThatâ€™s the man, my dear fellow; he was an annoyance to the cardinal.
Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t crush him flat. It seems that he came to himself

â€œAh! Monsieur de Richelieu would have said, â€˜Five hundred crowns for the

â€œWhy, Vulcan and Bayard cost me each about two hundred pistoles, and
putting Phoebus at a hundred and fifty, we should be pretty near the

NA
NA

â€œStop, I want to remember his exact words. He said, â€˜As to your friend,

At this moment nine oâ€™clock struck. Dâ€™Artagnan started.
NA
NA
â€œAh! stop! hold your peace, Porthos, donâ€™t remind me of it; â€˜tis that
NA
NA
â€œBecause it is a grievous thing for me to meet again those two men who

Dâ€™Artagnan did not believe Athos to be capable of a deception, but he
sought an excuse for not going to the rendezvous.
NA
were afraid. We who have faced fifty foes on the high road can well meet
NA
â€œYes, yes, but they took part with the princes without apprising us of
it. Athos and Aramis have played a game with me which alarms me. We
discovered yesterday the truth; what is the use of going to-day to learn
NA
NA
â€œOf Aramis, yes, since he has become an abbe. You canâ€™t imagine, my dear
fellow, the sort of man he is. He sees us on the road which leads him to

NA
NA
â€œPerhaps Monsieur de Beaufort will try, in his turn, to lay hands on
NA
â€œNonsense! He had us in his power and he let us go. Besides we can be on
our guard; let us take arms, let Planchet post himself behind us with

NA
â€œDevil take these civil wars! one can no more now reckon on oneâ€™s

NA
â€œSo long as you are rich! Ah! my friend! â€˜tis not civil war that
disunites us. It is that we are each of us twenty years older; it is
that the honest emotions of youth have given place to suggestions of
interest, whispers of ambition, counsels of selfishness. Yes, you are

the rendezvous, they would declare we were afraid. Halloo! Planchet!

â€œYes, but he has been avenged. He was carried home in the arms of the
people. His house has been full ever since. He has received visits from
the coadjutor, from Madame de Longueville, and the Prince de Conti;

Planchet began to sing:

Whilst all this was going on, Athos and Aramis were entering Paris by
the Faubourg St. Antoine. They had taken some refreshment on the road
and hastened on, that they might not fail at the appointed place. Bazin
was their only attendant, for Grimaud had stayed behind to take care of
Mousqueton. As they were passing onward, Athos proposed that they should
lay aside their arms and military costume, and assume a dress more
suited to the city.
NA
NA
NA
â€œThat the Place Royale is the termination to the main road to Vendomois,

NA
NA
NA
â€œWho can say whether Dâ€™Artagnan may not have betrayed us to the
cardinal? who can tell whether Mazarin may not take advantage of this

â€œWhat! Aramis, you think that Dâ€™Artagnan, that Porthos, would lend their

Athos crossed his arms and bowed his noble head.
â€œWhat can you expect, Athos? Men are so made; and we are not always
twenty years old. We have cruelly wounded, as you know, that personal
pride by which Dâ€™Artagnan is blindly governed. He has been beaten. Did
you not observe his despair on the journey? As to Porthos, his barony
was perhaps dependent on that affair. Well, he found us on his road and
will not be baron this time. Perhaps that famous barony will have
something to do with our interview this evening. Let us take our

â€œOh, never fear! besides, if they do, we can easily make an excuse; we

â€œNo, for I will not allow you to do so. â€˜Tis not one man, not Athos
only, not the Comte de la Fere whom you will ruin by this amiable
NA
NA
And they pursued their road in mournful silence.
Scarcely had they reached by the Rue de la Mule the iron gate of the
Place Royale, when they perceived three cavaliers, Dâ€™Artagnan, Porthos,
and Planchet, the two former wrapped up in their military cloaks under
which their swords were hidden, and Planchet, his musket by his side.
They were waiting at the entrance of the Rue Sainte Catharine, and their
horses were fastened to the rings of the arcade. Athos, therefore,
commanded Bazin to fasten up his horse and that of Aramis in the same
manner.
They then advanced two and two, and saluted each other politely.

inquired Aramis, perceiving that people were stopping to look at them,
supposing that they were going to engage in one of those far-famed duels
still extant in the memory of the Parisians, and especially the
inhabitants of the Place Royale.

Dâ€™Artagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the Place. Porthos
ventured to put his head between the railings, to try if his glance
could penetrate the gloom.
NA
NA
â€œThis place, if Monsieur dâ€™Herblay can procure the key, is the best that

Aramis went off at once, begging Athos not to remain alone within reach
of Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos; a piece of advice which was received with a
contemptuous smile.
Aramis returned soon with a man from the Hotel de Rohan, who was saying
to him:

NA
NA
NA
Athos did not lose sight of the two speakers. Aramis opened the gate and
faced around in order that Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos might enter. In
passing through the gate, the hilt of the lieutenantâ€™s sword was caught
in the grating and he was obliged to pull off his cloak; in doing so he
showed the butt end of his pistols and a ray of the moon was reflected
on the shining metal.
NA

his belt.
NA
He entered third, and Aramis, who shut the gate after him, last. The two
serving-men waited without; but as if they likewise mistrusted each
other, they kept their respective distances.
28. The Place Royale.
They proceeded silently to the centre of the Place, but as at this very
moment the moon had just emerged from behind a cloud, they thought they
might be observed if they remained on that spot and therefore regained
the shade of the lime-trees.
There were benches here and there; the four gentlemen stopped near them;
at a sign from Athos, Porthos and Dâ€™Artagnan sat down, the two others
stood in front of them.
After a few minutes of silent embarrassment, Athos spoke.
NA
friendship; not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous; not
NA
NA
each other, let us explain our conduct to each other, like men of right
NA
â€œI wish for nothing more; have you any cause of complaint against me or
NA
NA
Bragelonne, I made certain proposals to you which you perfectly
understood; instead of answering me as a friend, you played with me as a
child; the friendship, therefore, that you boast of was not broken
yesterday by the shock of swords, but by your dissimulation at your
NA
NA
â€œYou asked for candor and you have it. You ask what I have against you;
I tell you. And I have the same sincerity to show you, if you wish,
Monsieur dâ€™Herblay; I acted in a similar way to you and you also
NA
NA
seeking me to make to me certain proposals, but did you make them? No,
you sounded me, nothing more. Very well what did I say to you? that
Mazarin was contemptible and that I wouldnâ€™t serve Mazarin. But that is
all. Did I tell you that I wouldnâ€™t serve any other? On the contrary, I
gave you to understand, I think, that I adhered to the princes. We even
joked very pleasantly, if I remember rightly, on the very probable
contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my arrest. Were
you a party man? There is no doubt of that. Well, why should not we,
too, belong to a party? You had your secret and we had ours; we didnâ€™t
exchange them. So much the better; it proves that we know how to keep
NA
NA
Monsieur de la Fere has spoken of friendship that I question your
NA
NA
haughtily.
The blood mounted instantly to the temples of Dâ€™Artagnan, who arose, and
replied:
NA
On seeing Dâ€™Artagnan rise, Porthos rose also; these four men were
therefore all standing at the same time, with a menacing aspect,
opposite to each other.
Upon hearing Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s reply, Aramis seemed about to draw his sword,
when Athos prevented him.
NA
yesterdayâ€™s adventure. I believed your heart noble enough to enable a
friendship of twenty years to overcome an affront of a quarter of an
hour. Come, do you really think you have anything to say against me? Say
NA
The grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have
still its ancient influence, whilst that of Aramis, which had become
harsh and tuneless in his moments of ill-humor, irritated him. He
answered therefore:
â€œI think, monsieur le comte, that you had something to communicate to me
NA
Aramis--â€œhad also something to tell me when I was in his convent. At
that time I was not concerned in the adventure, in the course of which
you have so successfully estopped me! However, because I was prudent you
must not take me for a fool. If I had wished to widen the breach between
those whom Monsieur dâ€™Herblay chooses to receive with a rope ladder and
NA
NA
that Dâ€™Artagnan had acted as a spy on him and had seen him with Madame
de Longueville.
â€œI never meddle save with what concerns me, and I know how to make
believe that I havenâ€™t seen what does not concern me; but I hate
hypocrites, and among that number I place musketeers who are abbes and
NA
NA
Porthos, who had not spoken one word, answered merely by a word and a
gesture.
NA
Aramis started back and drew his. Dâ€™Artagnan bent forward, ready either
to attack or to stand on his defense.
Athos at that moment extended his hand with the air of supreme command
which characterized him alone, drew out his sword and the scabbard at
the same time, broke the blade in the sheath on his knee and threw the
pieces to his right. Then turning to Aramis:
NA
Aramis hesitated.
NA
NA
Then Aramis, paler than before, but subdued by these words, snapped the
serpent blade between his hands, and then folding his arms, stood
trembling with rage.
These proceedings made Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos draw back. Dâ€™Artagnan did
not draw his sword; Porthos put his back into the sheath.
NA
swear before God, who seeth us, and who, in the darkness of this night
heareth us, never shall my sword cross yours, never my eye express a
glance of anger, nor my heart a throb of hatred, at you. We lived
together, we loved, we hated together; we shed, we mingled our blood
together, and too probably, I may still add, that there may be yet a
bond between us closer even than that of friendship; perhaps there may
be the bond of crime; for we four, we once did condemn, judge and slay a
human being whom we had not any right to cut off from this world,
although apparently fitter for hell than for this life. Dâ€™Artagnan, I
have always loved you as my son; Porthos, we slept six years side by
side; Aramis is your brother as well as mine, and Aramis has once loved
you, as I love you now and as I have ever loved you. What can Cardinal
Mazarin be to us, to four men who compelled such a man as Richelieu to
act as we pleased? What is such or such a prince to us, who fixed the
diadem upon a great queenâ€™s head? Dâ€™Artagnan, I ask your pardon for
having yesterday crossed swords with you; Aramis does the same to
Porthos; now hate me if you can; but for my own part, I shall ever, even
if you do hate me, retain esteem and friendship for you. I repeat my
words, Aramis, and then, if you desire it, and if they desire it, let us

There was a solemn, though momentary silence, which was broken by
Aramis.

still trembling with recent emotion, â€œI swear that I no longer bear
animosity to those who were once my friends. I regret that I ever
crossed swords with you, Porthos; I swear not only that it shall never
again be pointed at your breast, but that in the bottom of my heart
there will never in future be the slightest hostile sentiment; now,

Athos was about to retire.

those irresistible impulses which showed the nobility of his nature, the
native brightness of his character; â€œI swear that I would give the last
drop of my blood and the last fragment of my limbs to preserve the

Forsooth! If I were obliged to fight against you, I think I should allow
myself to be pierced through and through, for I never loved any one but

embraced Athos.

irrevocably united, although we now pursue divergent roads. I respect
your convictions, and whilst we fight for opposite sides, let us remain
friends. Ministers, princes, kings, will pass away like mountain
torrents; civil war, like a forest flame; but we--we shall remain; I

Athos smiled with ineffable pleasure.
â€œâ€˜Tis then all settled. Gentlemen, your hands; are we not pretty good

said Aramis.
NA
NA
And he wiped his eyes, still moist.
NA
Aramis smiled and drew from his vest a cross of diamonds, which was hung

everything, and forever, and may this oath bind us to each other, and

29. The Ferry across the Oise.
We hope that the reader has not quite forgotten the young traveler whom
we left on the road to Flanders.
In losing sight of his guardian, whom he had quitted, gazing after him
in front of the royal basilican, Raoul spurred on his horse, in order
not only to escape from his own melancholy reflections, but also to hide
from Olivain the emotion his face might betray.
One hourâ€™s rapid progress, however, sufficed to disperse the gloomy
fancies that had clouded the young manâ€™s bright anticipations; and the
hitherto unfelt pleasure of freedom--a pleasure which is sweet even to
those who have never known dependence--seemed to Raoul to gild not only
Heaven and earth, but especially that blue but dim horizon of life we
call the future.
Nevertheless, after several attempts at conversation with Olivain he
foresaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull; and the
countâ€™s agreeable voice, his gentle and persuasive eloquence, recurred
to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about
which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details
which he would have drawn from Athos, the most amusing and the best
informed of guides. Another recollection contributed also to sadden
Raoul: on their arrival at Sonores he had perceived, hidden behind a
screen of poplars, a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of La
Valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at
it, and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to
Olivainâ€™s respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention.
The aspect of external objects is often a mysterious guide communicating
with the fibres of memory, which in spite of us will arouse them at
times; this thread, like that of Ariadne, when once unraveled will
conduct one through a labyrinth of thought, in which one loses oneâ€™s
self in endeavoring to follow that phantom of the past which is called
recollection.
Now the sight of this chateau had taken Raoul back fifty leagues
westward and had caused him to review his life from the moment when he
had taken leave of little Louise to that in which he had seen her for
the first time; and every branch of oak, every gilded weathercock on
roof of slates, reminded him that, instead of returning to the friends
of his childhood, every instant estranged him further and that perhaps
he had even left them forever.
With a full heart and burning head he desired Olivain to lead on the
horses to a wayside inn, which he observed within gunshot range, a
little in advance of the place they had reached.
As for himself, he dismounted and remained under a beautiful group of
chestnuts in flower, amidst which were murmuring a multitude of happy
bees, and bade Olivain send the host to him with writing paper and ink,
to be placed on a table which he found there, conveniently ready.
Olivain obeyed and continued on his way, whilst Raoul remained sitting,
with his elbow leaning on the table, from time to time gently shaking
the flowers from his head, which fell upon him like snow, and gazing
vaguely on the charming landscape spread out before him, dotted over
with green fields and groups of trees. Raoul had been there about ten
minutes, during five of which he was lost in reverie, when there
appeared within the circle comprised in his rolling gaze a man with a
rubicund face, who, with a napkin around his body, another under his
arm, and a white cap upon his head, approached him, holding paper, pen
and ink in hand.
NA
same fancy, for not a quarter of an hour ago a young lad, well mounted
like you, as tall as you and of about your age, halted before this clump
of trees and had this table and this chair brought here, and dined here,
with an old gentleman who seemed to be his tutor, upon a pie, of which
they havenâ€™t left a mouthful, and two bottles of Macon wine, of which
they havenâ€™t left a drop, but fortunately we have still some of the same
wine and some of the same pies left, and if your worship will but give
NA
NA
moment I want nothing but the things for which I have asked--only I
shall be very glad if the ink prove black and the pen good; upon these
conditions I will pay for the pen the price of the bottle, and for the
NA
NA
wine to your servant, and in this way you will have the pen and ink into
NA
NA
that particular class of society, who, when there were robbers on the
highroads, were connected with them, and who, since highwaymen no longer
exist, have advantageously and aptly filled their vacant place.
The host, his mind at ease about his bill, placed pen, ink and paper
upon the table. By a lucky chance the pen was tolerably good and Raoul
began to write. The host remained standing in front of him, looking with
a kind of involuntary admiration at his handsome face, combining both
gravity and sweetness of expression. Beauty has always been and always
will be all-powerful.
NA
to Olivain, who had rejoined his master to see if he wanted anything,
NA
â€œMy master had appetite enough three days ago, but what can one do? he
NA
And Olivain and the host took their way together toward the inn,
Olivain, according to the custom of serving-men well pleased with their
place, relating to the tavern-keeper all that he could say in favor of
the young gentleman; whilst Raoul wrote on thus:
â€œSir,--After a four hoursâ€™ march I stop to write to you, for I miss you
every moment, and I am always on the point of turning my head as if to
reply when you speak to me. I was so bewildered by your departure and so
overcome with grief at our separation, that I am sure I was able to but
very feebly express all the affection and gratitude I feel toward you.
You will forgive me, sir, for your heart is of such a generous nature
that you can well understand all that has passed in mine. I entreat you
to write to me, for you form a part of my existence, and, if I may
venture to tell you so, I also feel anxious. It seemed to me as if you
were yourself preparing for some dangerous undertaking, about which I
did not dare to question you, since you told me nothing. I have,
therefore, as you see, great need of hearing from you. Now that you are
no longer beside me I am afraid every moment of erring. You sustained me
powerfully, sir, and I protest to you that to-day I feel very lonely.
Will you have the goodness, sir, should you receive news from Blois, to
send me a few lines about my little friend Mademoiselle de la Valliere,
about whose health, when we left, so much anxiety was felt? You can
understand, honored and dear guardian, how precious and indispensable to
me is the remembrance of the years that I have passed with you. I hope
that you will sometimes, too, think of me, and if at certain hours you
should miss me, if you should feel any slight regret at my absence, I
shall be overwhelmed with joy at the thought that you appreciate my
affection for and my devotion to yourself, and that I have been able to

After finishing this letter Raoul felt more composed; he looked well
around him to see if Olivain and the host might not be watching him,
whilst he impressed a kiss upon the paper, a mute and touching caress,
which the heart of Athos might well divine on opening the letter.
During this time Olivain had finished his bottle and eaten his pie; the
horses were also refreshed. Raoul motioned to the host to approach,
threw a crown upon the table, mounted his horse, and posted his letter
at Senlis. The rest that had been thus afforded to men and horses
enabled them to continue their journey at a good round pace. At
Verberie, Raoul desired Olivain to make some inquiry about the young man
who was preceding them; he had been observed to pass only three-quarters
of an hour previously, but he was well mounted, as the tavern-keeper had
already said, and rode at a rapid pace.
NA
ourselves he is on his way to join the army and may prove agreeable
NA
It was about four oâ€™clock in the afternoon when Raoul arrived at
Compiegne; there he dined heartily and again inquired about the young
gentleman who was in advance of them. He had stopped, like Raoul, at the
Hotel of the Bell and Bottle, the best at Compiegne; and had started
again on his journey, saying that he should sleep at Noyon.
NA
NA

to sleep here and to start again very early to-morrow. Eighteen leagues

on, then, to Noyon; it will be a stage similar to those we traveled from
Blois to Paris. We shall arrive at eight oâ€™clock. The horses will have a
long nightâ€™s rest, and at five oâ€™clock to-morrow morning we can be again

Olivain dared offer no opposition to this determination but he followed
his master, grumbling.

It was easy to see that Olivain had not been taught in the school of the
Planchets and the Grimauds. Raoul really felt tired, but he was desirous
of testing his strength, and, brought up in the principles of Athos and
certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of
twenty-five leagues, he did not wish to fall far short of his model.
Dâ€™Artagnan, that man of iron, who seemed to be made of nerve and muscle
only, had struck him with admiration. Therefore, in spite of Olivainâ€™s
remarks, he continued to urge his steed more and more, and following a
pleasant little path, leading to a ferry, and which he had been assured
shortened the journey by the distance of one league, he arrived at the
summit of a hill and perceived the river flowing before him. A little
troop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream, ready
to embark. Raoul did not doubt this was the gentleman and his escort; he
called out to him, but they were too distant to be heard; then, in spite
of the weariness of his beast, he made it gallop but the rising ground
soon deprived him of all sight of the travelers, and when he had again
attained a new height, the ferryboat had left the shore and was making
for the opposite bank. Raoul, seeing that he could not arrive in time to
cross the ferry with the travelers, halted to wait for Olivain. At this
moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the river. Raoul
turned toward the side whence the cry had sounded, and shaded his eyes
from the glare of the setting sun with his hand.
NA
A second scream, more piercing than the first, now sounded.
NA
and the boat is drifting. But what do I see in the water--something
NA
NA
NA
NA
It was true, and Raoul was convinced that some accident had happened and
that a man was drowning; he gave his horse its head, struck his spurs
into its sides, and the animal, urged by pain and feeling that he had
space open before him, bounded over a kind of paling which inclosed the
landing place, and fell into the river, scattering to a distance waves
of white froth.
NA
Raoul was directing his horse toward the unhappy man in danger. This
was, in fact, a custom familiar to him. Having been brought up on the
banks of the Loire, he might have been said to have been cradled on its
waves; a hundred times he had crossed it on horseback, a thousand times
had swum across. Athos, foreseeing the period when he should make a
soldier of the viscount, had inured him to all kinds of arduous
undertakings.
NA
NA
NA
forward.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Olivain advanced, retired, then made his horse rear--turned it and then,
struck to the core by shame, leaped, as Raoul had done, only repeating:
NA
In the meantime, the ferryboat had floated away, carried down by the
stream, and the shrieks of those whom it contained resounded more and
more. A man with gray hair had thrown himself from the boat into the
river and was swimming vigorously toward the person who was drowning;
but being obliged to go against the current he advanced but slowly.
Raoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground; but the horse
and its rider, of whom he did not lose sight, were evidently sinking.
The nostrils of the horse were no longer above water, and the rider, who
had lost the reins in struggling, fell with his head back and his arms
extended. One moment longer and all would disappear.
NA
NA
The water closed above his head and stifled his voice.
Raoul sprang from his horse, to which he left the charge of its own
preservation, and in three or four strokes was at the gentlemanâ€™s side;
he seized the horse at once by the curb and raised its head above water;
the animal began to breathe again and, as if he comprehended that they
had come to his aid, redoubled his efforts. Raoul at the same time
seized one of the young manâ€™s hands and placed it on the mane, which it
grasped with the tenacity of a drowning man. Thus, sure that the rider
would not release his hold, Raoul now only directed his attention to the
horse, which he guided to the opposite bank, helping it to cut through
the water and encouraging it with words.
All at once the horse stumbled against a ridge and then placed its foot
on the sand.
NA
NA
and sliding from the saddle into Raoulâ€™s arms; Raoul was but ten yards
from the shore; there he bore the fainting man, and laying him down upon
the grass, unfastened the buttons of his collar and unhooked his
doublet. A moment later the gray-headed man was beside him. Olivain
managed in his turn to land, after crossing himself repeatedly; and the
people in the ferryboat guided themselves as well as they were able
toward the bank, with the aid of a pole which chanced to be in the boat.
Thanks to the attentions of Raoul and the man who accompanied the young
gentleman, the color gradually returned to the pale cheeks of the dying
man, who opened his eyes, at first entirely bewildered, but who soon
fixed his gaze upon the person who had saved him.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAh, there you are, my good Dâ€™Arminges; I have given you a great fright,
have I not? but it is your own fault. You were my tutor, why did you not

river when the cord of the ferryboat broke. Alarmed by the cries and
gestures of the boatmen, my horse sprang into the water. I cannot swim,
and dared not throw myself into the river. Instead of aiding the
movements of my horse, I paralyzed them; and I was just going to drown
myself with the best grace in the world, when you arrived just in time
to pull me out of the water; therefore, sir, if you will agree,

The young men had no objection to this proposition; on the contrary,
they thought it very timely.
They mounted again at once, whilst looks of admiration passed between
them. They were indeed two elegant horsemen, with figures slight and
upright, noble faces, bright and proud looks, loyal and intelligent
smiles.
De Guiche might have been about eighteen years of age, but he was
scarcely taller than Raoul, who was only fifteen.
30. Skirmishing.
The halt at Noyon was but brief, every one there being wrapped in
profound sleep. Raoul had desired to be awakened should Grimaud arrive,
but Grimaud did not arrive. Doubtless, too, the horses on their part
appreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which
was granted them. The Count de Guiche was awakened at five oâ€™clock in
the morning by Raoul, who came to wish him good-day. They breakfasted in
haste, and at six oâ€™clock had already gone ten miles.
The young countâ€™s conversation was most interesting to Raoul, therefore
he listened much, whilst the count talked well and long. Brought up in
Paris, where Raoul had been but once; at the court, which Raoul had
never seen; his follies as page; two duels, which he had already found
the means of fighting, in spite of the edicts against them and, more
especially, in spite of his tutorâ€™s vigilance--these things excited the
greatest curiosity in Raoul. Raoul had only been at M. Scarronâ€™s house;
he named to Guiche the people whom he had seen there. Guiche knew
everybody--Madame de Neuillan, Mademoiselle dâ€™Aubigne, Mademoiselle de
Scudery, Mademoiselle Paulet, Madame de Chevreuse. He criticised
everybody humorously. Raoul trembled, lest he should laugh among the
rest at Madame de Chevreuse, for whom he entertained deep and genuine
sympathy, but either instinctively, or from affection for the duchess,
he said everything in her favor. His praises increased Raoulâ€™s
friendship twofold. Then came the question of gallantry and love
affairs. Under this head, also, Bragelonne had much more to hear than to
tell. He listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through
three or four rather frivolous adventures, that the count, like himself,
had a secret to hide in the depths of his heart.
De Guiche, as we have said before, had been educated at the court, and
the intrigues of this court were not unknown to him. It was the same
court of which Raoul had so often heard the Comte de la Fere speak,
except that its aspect had much changed since the period when Athos had
himself been part of it; therefore everything which the Count de Guiche
related was new to his traveling companion. The young count, witty and
caustic, passed all the world in review; the queen herself was not
spared, and Cardinal Mazarin came in for his share of ridicule.
The day passed away as rapidly as an hour. The countâ€™s tutor, a man of
the world and a bon vivant, up to his eyes in learning, as his pupil
described him, often recalled the profound erudition, the witty and
caustic satire of Athos to Raoul; but as regarded grace, delicacy, and
nobility of external appearance, no one in these points was to be
compared to the Comte de la Fere.
The horses, which were more kindly used than on the previous day,
stopped at Arras at four oâ€™clock in the evening. They were approaching
the scene of war; and as bands of Spaniards sometimes took advantage of
the night to make expeditions even as far as the neighborhood of Arras,
they determined to remain in the town until the morrow. The French army
held all between Pont-a-Marc as far as Valenciennes, falling back upon
Douai. The prince was said to be in person at Bethune.
The enemyâ€™s army extended from Cassel to Courtray; and as there was no
species of violence or pillage it did not commit, the poor people on the
frontier quitted their isolated dwellings and fled for refuge into the
strong cities which held out a shelter to them. Arras was encumbered
with fugitives. An approaching battle was much spoken of, the prince
having manoeuvred, until that movement, only in order to await a
reinforcement that had just reached him.
The young men congratulated themselves on having arrived so opportunely.
The evening was employed in discussing the war; the grooms polished
their arms; the young men loaded the pistols in case of a skirmish, and
they awoke in despair, having both dreamed that they had arrived too
late to participate in the battle. In the morning it was rumored that
Prince de Conde had evacuated Bethune and fallen back on Carvin,
leaving, however, a strong garrison in the former city.
But as there was nothing positively certain in this report, the young
warriors decided to continue their way toward Bethune, free on the road
to diverge to the right and march to Carvin if necessary.
The countâ€™s tutor was well acquainted with the country; he consequently
proposed to take a crossroad, which lay between that of Lens and that of
Bethune. They obtained information at Ablain, and a statement of their
route was left for Grimaud. About seven oâ€™clock in the morning they set
out. De Guiche, who was young and impulsive, said to Raoul, â€œHere we
are, three masters and three servants. Our valets are well armed and
NA
NA
NA
NA
required. On my side I have two sure men, who have been in action with
my father. We therefore represent six fighting men; if we should meet a
little troop of enemies, equal or even superior in number to our own,

NA
NA
conversation. â€œZounds! how you manoeuvre my instructions, count! You
seem to forget the orders I received to conduct you safe and sound to
his highness the prince! Once with the army you may be killed at your
good pleasure; but until that time, I warn you that in my capacity of
general of the army I shall order a retreat and turn my back on the
NA
other, smiling.
They arrived at Ablain without accident. There they inquired and learned
that the prince had in reality quitted Bethune and stationed himself
between Cambria and La Venthie. Therefore, leaving directions at every
place for Grimaud, they took a crossroad which conducted the little
troop by the bank of a small stream flowing into the Lys. The country
was beautiful, intersected by valleys as green as the emerald. Here and
there they passed little copses crossing the path which they were
following. In anticipation of some ambuscade in each of these little
woods the tutor placed his two servants at the head of the band, thus
forming the advance guard. Himself and the two young men represented the
body of the army, whilst Olivain, with his rifle upon his knee and his
eyes upon the watch, protected the rear.
They had observed for some time before them, on the horizon, a rather
thick wood; and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps
from it, Monsieur dâ€™Arminges took his usual precautions and sent on in
advance the countâ€™s two grooms. The servants had just disappeared under
the trees, followed by the tutor, and the young men were laughing and
talking about a hundred yards off. Olivain was at the same distance in
the rear, when suddenly there resounded five or six musket-shots. The
tutor cried halt; the young men obeyed, pulling up their steeds, and at
the same moment the two valets were seen returning at a gallop.
The young men, impatient to learn the cause of the firing, spurred on
toward the servants. The tutor followed them.
NA
NA
seen; the shots were fired about a hundred paces in advance of us, in
NA
NA
will, that we beat a retreat. There may be an ambuscade concealed in
NA
NA
NA
yellow, creeping along the bed of the stream.
NA
NA
The two youths looked at each other, and at this moment a pistol-shot
and cries for help were heard. Another glance between the young men
convinced them both that neither had any wish to go back, and as the
tutor had already turned his horseâ€™s head, they both spurred forward,
NA
NA
surprise they had both disappeared into the forest. Whilst they spurred
their steeds they held their pistols ready also. In five minutes they
arrived at the spot whence the noise had proceeded, and then restraining
their horses, they advanced cautiously.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
But he was not listened to, and his cries only served to arouse the
attention of the Spaniards.
The men on horseback at once rushed at the two youths, leaving the three
others to complete the plunder of the dead or wounded travelers; for on
approaching nearer, instead of one extended figure, the young men
discovered two. De Guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed
his man; and the Spaniard, who had advanced to meet Raoul, aimed in his
turn, and Raoul felt a pain in the left arm, similar to that of a blow
from a whip. He let off his fire at but four paces. Struck in the breast
and extending his arms, the Spaniard fell back on the crupper, and the
terrified horse, turning around, carried him off.
Raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him, and
remembering the recommendation of Athos, he, with the rapidity of
lightning, made his horse rear as the shot was fired. His horse bounded
to one side, losing its footing, and fell, entangling Raoulâ€™s leg under
its body. The Spaniard sprang forward and seized the gun by its muzzle,
in order to strike Raoul on the head with the butt. In the position in
which Raoul lay, unfortunately, he could neither draw his sword from the
scabbard, nor his pistols from their holsters. The butt end of the
musket hovered over his head, and he could scarcely restrain himself
from closing his eyes, when with one bound Guiche reached the Spaniard
NA
NA
instant. Guiche summoned one of his grooms, and delivering the prisoner
into his charge, with orders to shoot him through the head if he
attempted to escape, he leaped from his horse and approached Raoul.

Monsieur dâ€™Arminges and Olivain had already dismounted and were
attempting to raise the struggling horse. At last Raoul succeeded in
drawing his foot from the stirrup and his leg from under the animal, and
in a second he was on his feet again.

They approached the spot where the unfortunate victims lay.
31. The Monk.
Two men lay prone upon the ground, one bathed in blood and motionless,
with his face toward the earth; this one was dead. The other leaned
against a tree, supported there by the two valets, and was praying
fervently, with clasped hands and eyes raised to Heaven. He had received
a ball in his thigh, which had broken the bone. The young men first
approached the dead man.

dared to accompany the good man, so I offered to do so.

NA
NA
NA
â€œNo, but I know a little about wounds, and mine, I know, is mortal. Try,
therefore, either to carry me to some place where I may see a priest or
take the trouble to send one to me here. It is my soul that must be

â€œThank you, and God reward you! About half a mile from this, on the same
road, there is an inn, and about a mile further on, after leaving the
inn, you will reach the village of Greney. There you must find the
curate, or if he is not at home, go to the convent of the Augustines,
which is the last house on the right, and bring me one of the brothers.

NA
NA
â€œDo not fear. Besides, we are safe for to-day; you know the axiom, â€˜Non

The two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten
minutes reached the inn. Raoul, without dismounting, called to the host
and announced that a wounded man was about to be brought to his house
and begged him in the meantime to prepare everything needful. He desired
him also, should he know in the neighborhood any doctor or chirurgeon,
to fetch him, taking on himself the payment of the messenger.
The host, who saw two young noblemen, richly clad, promised everything
they required, and our two cavaliers, after seeing that preparations for
the reception were actually begun, started off again and proceeded
rapidly toward Greney.
They had gone rather more than a league and had begun to descry the
first houses of the village, the red-tiled roofs of which stood out from
the green trees which surrounded them, when, coming toward them mounted
on a mule, they perceived a poor monk, whose large hat and gray worsted
dress made them take him for an Augustine brother. Chance for once
seemed to favor them in sending what they were so assiduously seeking.
He was a man about twenty-two or twenty-three years old, but who
appeared much older from ascetic exercises. His complexion was pale, not
of that deadly pallor which is a kind of neutral beauty, but of a
bilious, yellow hue; his colorless hair was short and scarcely extended
beyond the circle formed by the hat around his head, and his light blue
eyes seemed destitute of any expression.
NA
NA
NA
was barely civil.
NA
The stranger touched his mule with his heel and continued his way.
In a second De Guiche had sprung before him and barred his passage.

â€œI suppose I am free to say or not to say who I am to two strangers who

It was with difficulty that De Guiche restrained the intense desire he
had of breaking the monkâ€™s bones.

Viscount of Bragelonne and I am the Count de Guiche. Nor was it from
caprice we asked the question, for there is a wounded and dying man who
demands the succor of the church. If you be a priest, I conjure you in
the name of humanity to follow me to aid this man; if you be not, it is
a different matter, and I warn you in the name of courtesy, of which you
appear profoundly ignorant, that I shall chastise you for your

The pale face of the monk became so livid and his smile so strange, that
Raoul, whose eyes were still fixed upon him, felt as if this smile had
struck to his heart like an insult.

Raoul.

In the space of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain whether
he was followed or not.

are you not, viscount? and I see you playing with the pommel of your
sword, as if you had a great inclination to break the holy fatherâ€™s

â€œYes, count, it is a strange thing and one which might astonish you, but
I feel an indescribable horror at the sight of yonder man. Have you ever

NA
â€œWell, it has happened to me to do so in our Blaisois forests, and I
remember that the first time I encountered one with its eyes fixed upon
me, curled up, swinging its head and pointing its tongue, I remained
fixed, pale and as though fascinated, until the moment when the Comte de

NA
NA
NA
NA
â€˜Come, Bragelonne, draw your sword;â€™ then only I rushed upon the reptile
and cut it in two, just at the moment when it was rising on its tail and
hissing, ere it sprang upon me. Well, I vow I felt exactly the same
sensation at sight of that man when he said, â€˜Why do you ask me that?â€™
NA
NA
NA
They had now arrived within sight of the little inn and could see on the
opposite side the procession bearing the wounded man and guided by
Monsieur dâ€™Arminges. The youths spurred on.
NA
Augustine brother. â€œBe good enough to hurry yourself a little, monsieur
NA
As for Raoul, he avoided the monk by the whole width of the road and
passed him, turning his head away in repulsion.
The young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were
followed by the priest. He raised himself to glance in the direction
which they pointed out, saw the monk, and fell back upon the litter, his
face illumined by joy.

At this moment the wounded man arrived from one direction and the monk
from the other, the latter dismounting from his mule and desiring that
it should be taken to the stables without being unharnessed.
NA
NA
NA
Bragelonne shudder.
NA
NA
men spurred on.
The litter, borne by two servants, now entered the house. The host and
his wife were standing on the steps, whilst the unhappy man seemed to
suffer dreadful pain and yet to be concerned only to know if he was
followed by the monk. At sight of this pale, bleeding man, the wife
grasped her husbandâ€™s arm.

back and showing on his countenance the feeling of repugnance which his
penitent inspired.
Monsieur dâ€™Arminges, who was at the door, perceived his hesitation.
NA
unfortunate being is none the less a man. Render to him, then, the last
service he can by any possibility ask of you, and your work will be all
NA
The monk made no reply, but silently wended his way to the room where
the two valets had deposited the dying man on a bed. Dâ€™Arminges and
Olivain and the two grooms then mounted their horses, and all four
started off at a quick trot to rejoin Raoul and his companion. Just as
the tutor and his escort disappeared in their turn, a new traveler
stopped on the threshold of the inn.
NA
from the discovery he had just made.
The traveler made a sign as if he wished to drink, and then pointed to
his horse and gesticulated like a man who is brushing something.

NA

â€œTo know if you have seen a young man pass, fifteen years of age,

â€œThe Viscount de Bragelonne?
NA

The traveler made a sign of assent.

NA
NA
NA

Grimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on
the table to be filled a second time, when a terrific scream resounded
from the room occupied by the monk and the dying man. Grimaud sprang up.
NA
NA
NA
â€œThe former executioner of Bethune, who has just been brought in here,
assassinated by Spaniards, and who is now being confessed by an

recollection.
At this instant a second cry, less piercing than the first, but followed
by prolonged groaning, was heard.
The three listeners looked at one another in alarm.
NA
NA
host.
NA
If Grimaud was slow in speaking, we know that he was quick to act; he
sprang to the door and shook it violently, but it was bolted on the
other side.
NA
No reply.
NA
The same silence, and then, ere the host could oppose his design,
Grimaud seized a pair of pincers he perceived in a corner and forced the
bolt. The room was inundated with blood, dripping from the mattresses
upon which lay the wounded man, speechless; the monk had disappeared.
NA
Grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the courtyard.
NA
NA
NA
NA
The host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously, whilst
Grimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man, whose worn, hard
features awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the past.
NA
NA
Making no reply, Grimaud opened the poor manâ€™s jacket to feel if the
heart beat, whilst the host approached in his turn; but in a moment they
both fell back, the host uttering a cry of horror and Grimaud becoming
pallid. The blade of a dagger was buried up to the hilt in the left side
of the executioner.
NA
The host quitted the room in agitation, and as for his wife, she had
fled at the sound of her husbandâ€™s cries.
32. The Absolution.
This is what had taken place: We have seen that it was not of his own
free will, but, on the contrary, very reluctantly, that the monk
attended the wounded man who had been recommended to him in so strange a
manner. Perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any
possibility of doing so. He was restrained by the threats of the two
gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants, who doubtless had
received their instructions. And besides, he considered it most
expedient, without exhibiting too much ill-will, to follow to the end
his role as confessor.
The monk entered the chamber and approached the bed of the wounded man.
The executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to
those who are about to die and have no time to lose. He made a movement
of surprise and said:
NA
NA
â€œAlas, speak to me more gently, father; in my last moments I need a

NA
NA
NA

could claim--â€œthat is to say, I was, but am no longer; it is fifteen
years since I gave up the office. I still assist at executions, but no
NA
NA
â€œSo long as I struck in the name of the law and of justice my profession
allowed me to sleep quietly, sheltered as I was by justice and law; but
since that terrible night when I became an instrument of private
vengeance and when with personal hatred I raised the sword over one of

The executioner paused and shook his head with an expression of despair.
NA
began to be interested in a story so strangely introduced.
NA
after long suppression, â€œah! I have sought to stifle remorse by twenty
years of good deeds; I have assuaged the natural ferocity of those who
shed blood; on every occasion I have exposed my life to save those who
were in danger, and I have preserved lives in exchange for that I took
away. That is not all; the money gained in the exercise of my profession
I have distributed to the poor; I have been assiduous in attending
church and those who formerly fled from me have become accustomed to
seeing me. All have forgiven me, some have even loved me; but I think
that God has not pardoned me, for the memory of that execution pursues
me constantly and every night I see that womanâ€™s ghost rising before
NA
NA
NA
ever in my ears--â€˜assassinated!â€™ I have assassinated, then, and not
NA
closed his eyes with a groan.
The monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying more, for he
exclaimed eagerly:
â€œGo on, I know nothing, as yet; when you have finished your story, God
NA
NA
he feared on opening them to see some frightful object, â€œit is
especially when night comes on and when I have to cross a river, that
this terror which I have been unable to conquer comes upon me; it then
seems as if my hand grew heavy, as if the cutlass was still in its
grasp, as if the water had the color of blood, and all the voices of
nature--the whispering of the trees, the murmur of the wind, the lapping
of the wave--united in a voice tearful, despairing, terrible, crying to
NA
NA
The executioner opened his eyes, turned toward the young man and grasped
his arm.
NA
too well. It was evening; I had thrown the body into the river and those
words which my remorse repeats to me are those which I in my pride
pronounced. After being the instrument of human justice I aspired to be

NA
â€œIt was at night. A man came to me and showed me an order and I followed
him. Four other noblemen awaited me. They led me away masked. I reserved
the right of refusing if the office they required of me should seem
unjust. We traveled five or six leagues, serious, silent, and almost
without speaking. At length, through the window of a little hut, they
showed me a woman sitting, leaning on a table, and said, â€˜there is the
NA
NA
â€œFather, that woman was a monster. It was said that she had poisoned her
second husband; she had tried to assassinate her brother-in-law; she had
just poisoned a young woman who was her rival, and before leaving
England she had, it was believed, caused the favorite of the king to be

NA
NA
NA

The monk turned pale, wiped his brow and went and bolted the door. The
executioner thought that he had abandoned him and fell back, groaning,
upon his bed.
NA
NA
â€œOne of them was a foreigner, English, I think. The four others were
NA
NA
â€œI donâ€™t know them, but the four other noblemen called the Englishman
NA
NA
â€œYoung and beautiful. Oh, yes, especially beautiful. I see her now, as
on her knees at my feet, with her head thrown back, she begged for life.
I have never understood how I could have laid low a head so beautiful,
NA
The monk seemed agitated by a strange emotion; he trembled all over; he
seemed eager to put a question which yet he dared not ask. At length,
with a violent effort at self-control:
NA
â€œI donâ€™t know what it was. As I have said, she was twice married, once
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA

The executioner raised himself on his elbow and gazed with a frightened
air at the monk, who became livid.
NA
cowards who dared not kill her themselves? You had no pity for that
NA
â€œAlas! I have already told you, father, that woman, under that angelic
appearance, had an infernal soul, and when I saw her, when I recalled
NA
NA
â€œShe had seduced and ruined my brother, a priest. She had fled with him
NA
NA
â€œYes, my brother was her first lover, and she caused his death. Oh,
father, do not look in that way at me! Oh, I am guilty, then; you will
NA
The monk recovered his usual expression.
NA
NA
â€œAnswer, then. If she seduced your brother--you said she seduced him,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
he fell back on the bed, pale, trembling, and apparently about to die.
NA
NA
The dying man collected all his forces.
The monkâ€™s eyes glittered.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The executioner uttered the first cry, that terrible cry which had been
first heard.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo pity for him who had no pity! Die, impenitent, die in despair, die
NA
NA
Then was heard that second cry, not so loud as the first and followed by
a long groan.
The executioner, who had lifted himself up, fell back upon his bed. As
to the monk, without withdrawing the poniard from the wound, he ran to
the window, opened it, leaped out into the flowers of a small garden,
glided onward to the stable, took out his mule, went out by a back gate,
ran to a neighbouring thicket, threw off his monkish garb, took from his
valise the complete habiliment of a cavalier, clothed himself in it,
went on foot to the first post, secured there a horse and continued with
a loose rein his journey to Paris.
33. Grimaud Speaks.
Grimaud was left alone with the executioner, who in a few moments opened
his eyes.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Grimaud.
NA
NA
now before him.
NA
â€œOne night, twenty years ago, my master fetched you from Bethune and

NA
NA

â€œI was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my horse. They told me
the executioner of Bethune was here and wounded, when you uttered two
piercing cries. At the first we ran to the door and at the second forced

NA
NA
NA
â€œNo, he was no longer here; he appears to have fled by the window. Was

Grimaud moved as if to leave the room.
NA
NA
â€œDo not attempt it; he has revenged himself and has done well. Now I may

Grimaud trembled and stared at the dying man in a dull and leaden
manner.

NA
â€œI pronounced no name, for I knew none, except his motherâ€™s, as a young
girl, and it was by this name that he recognized her, but he knows that

Thus speaking, he fell back exhausted. Grimaud, wishing to relieve him,
advanced his hand toward the hilt of the dagger.
NA
NA
Grimaud remained with his hand extended; then, striking his forehead, he
exclaimed:
â€œOh! if this man should ever discover the names of the others, my master
NA
NA
lives; warn his friends, too. My death, believe me, will not be the end

NA
NA
NA
â€œTwo young gentlemen, who were on their way to join the army and the
name of one of whom I heard his companion mention--the Viscount de

â€œAnd it was this young man who brought the monk to you? Then it was the
will of God that it should be so and this it is which makes it all so
NA
NA
â€œOn oneâ€™s death-bed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison
NA
closed his eyes.
Grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the
necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the Comte de la
Fere. Whilst he thus hesitated the host re-entered the room, followed
not only by a surgeon, but by many other persons, whom curiosity had
attracted to the spot. The surgeon approached the dying man, who seemed
to have fainted.
NA
head in a significant manner.
The prophecy which the wounded man had just uttered recurred to Grimaud,
who turned away his head. The weapon, as we have already stated, was
plunged into the body to the hilt, and as the surgeon, taking it by the
end, drew it forth, the wounded man opened his eyes and fixed them on
him in a manner truly frightful. When at last the blade had been
entirely withdrawn, a red froth issued from the mouth of the wounded man
and a stream of blood spouted afresh from the wound when he at length
drew breath; then, fixing his eyes upon Grimaud with a singular
expression, the dying man uttered the last death-rattle and expired.
Then Grimaud, lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was
gliding along the room, to the horror of all present, made a sign to the
host to follow him, paid him with a generosity worthy of his master and
again mounted his horse. Grimaudâ€™s first intention had been to return to
Paris, but he remembered the anxiety which his prolonged absence might
occasion Raoul, and reflecting that there were now only two miles
between the vicomte and himself and a quarter of an hourâ€™s riding would
unite them, and that the going, returning and explanation would not
occupy an hour, he put spurs to his horse and a few minutes after had
reached the only inn of Mazingarbe.
Raoul was seated at table with the Count de Guiche and his tutor, when
all at once the door opened and Grimaud presented himself,
travel-stained, dirty, and sprinkled with the blood of the unhappy
executioner.
NA
Excuse me, sirs, this is not a servant, but a friend. How did you leave
NA
since I left him? Answer, for I have many things to tell you, too;
indeed, the last three days some odd adventures have happened--but what

â€œIt is the blood of the unfortunate man whom you left at the inn and who

is not exempted. I had a bad opinion of him the moment I saw his wound,
and since he asked for a monk you know that it was his opinion, too,

At the mention of the monk, Grimaud became pale.

interfere with a repast.

you were to remain with me and that Olivain should return to Paris. I

NA
NA
NA
NA

turned toward the door to go out.
Raoul, angry and at the same time uneasy, ran after him and seized him

NA
NA
NA
NA
trembling upon his chair.
â€œI can tell you but one thing, sir, for the secret you wish to know is

NA
The young men looked at each other with an expression of fear.
â€œYou conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him,
NA
NA
â€œVery well; if ever you meet him again, wherever it may be, whether on
the high road or in the street or in a church, anywhere that he or you
may be, put your foot on his neck and crush him without pity, without
mercy, as you would crush a viper or a scorpion! destroy him utterly and
quit him not until he is dead; the lives of five men are not safe, in my
NA
And without adding another word, Grimaud, profiting by the astonishment
and terror into which he had thrown his auditors, rushed from the room.
Two minutes later the thunder of a horseâ€™s hoofs was heard upon the
road; it was Grimaud, on his way to Paris. When once in the saddle
Grimaud reflected on two things; first, that at the pace he was going
his horse would not carry him ten miles, and secondly, that he had no
money. But Grimaudâ€™s ingenuity was more prolific than his speech, and
therefore at the first halt he sold his steed and with the money
obtained from the purchase took post horses.
34. On the Eve of Battle.
Raoul was aroused from his sombre reflections by his host, who rushed
NA
That cry was of such importance as to overcome all preoccupation. The
young men made inquiries and ascertained that the enemy was advancing by
way of Houdin and Bethune.
While Monsieur dâ€™Arminges gave orders for the horses to be made ready
for departure, the two young men ascended to the upper windows of the
house and saw in the direction of Marsin and of Lens a large body of
infantry and cavalry. This time it was not a wandering troop of
partisans; it was an entire army. There was therefore nothing for them
to do but to follow the prudent advice of Monsieur dâ€™Arminges and beat a
retreat. They quickly went downstairs. Monsieur dâ€™Arminges was already
mounted. Olivain had ready the horses of the young men, and the lackeys
of the Count de Guiche guarded carefully between them the Spanish
prisoner, mounted on a pony which had been bought for his use. As a
further precaution they had bound his hands.
The little company started off at a trot on the road to Cambrin, where
they expected to find the prince. But he was no longer there, having
withdrawn on the previous evening to La Bassee, misled by false
intelligence of the enemyâ€™s movements. Deceived by this intelligence he
had concentrated his forces between Vieille-Chapelle and La Venthie; and
after a reconnoissance along the entire line, in company with Marshal de
Grammont, he had returned and seated himself before a table, with his
officers around him. He questioned them as to the news they had each
been charged to obtain, but nothing positive had been learned. The
hostile army had disappeared two days before and seemed to have gone out
of existence.
Now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening, as when
he has completely disappeared. The prince was, therefore, contrary to
his custom, gloomy and anxious, when an officer entered and announced to
Marshal de Grammont that some one wished to see him.
The Duc de Grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and
went out. The prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at
the door; no one ventured to speak, for fear of disturbing him.
Suddenly a dull and heavy noise was heard. The prince leaped to his
feet, extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound, there
was no mistaking it--it was the noise of cannon. Every one stood up.
At that moment the door opened.
NA

Viscount de Bragelonne, to come in and give news of the enemy, whom they

The marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face
with the prince.

NA
It fell naturally to the Count de Guiche to make reply; not only was he
the elder, but he had been presented to the prince by his father.
Besides, he had long known the prince, whilst Raoul now saw him for the
first time. He therefore narrated to the prince what they had seen from
the inn at Mazingarbe.
Meanwhile Raoul closely observed the young general, already made so
famous by the battles of Rocroy, Fribourg, and Nordlingen.
Louis de Bourbon, Prince de Conde, who, since the death of his father,
Henri de Bourbon, was called, in accordance with the custom of that
period, Monsieur le Prince, was a young man, not more than twenty-six or
twenty-seven years old, with the eye of an eagle--aglâ€™ occhi grifani, as
Dante says--aquiline nose, long, waving hair, of medium height, well
formed, possessed of all the qualities essential to the successful
soldier--that is to say, the rapid glance, quick decision, fabulous
courage. At the same time he was a man of elegant manners and strong
mind, so that in addition to the revolution he had made in war, by his
new contributions to its methods, he had also made a revolution at
Paris, among the young noblemen of the court, whose natural chief he was
and who, in distinction from the social leaders of the ancient court,
modeled after Bassompierre, Bellegarde and the Duke dâ€™Angouleme, were
called the petits-maitres.
At the first words of the Count de Guiche, the prince, having in mind
the direction whence came the sound of cannon, had understood
everything. The enemy was marching upon Lens, with the intention,
doubtless, of securing possession of that town and separating from
France the army of France. But in what force was the enemy? Was it a
corps sent out to make a diversion? Was it an entire army? To this
question De Guiche could not respond.
Now, as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence, it was
these to which the prince had especially desired an answer, exact,
precise, positive.
Raoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and
approaching the prince:
NA
NA
The prince turned and seemed to cover the young man with a single
glance; he smiled on perceiving that he was a child hardly fifteen years
old.
NA
tones, as if he were speaking to a woman.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
smiling.
The old marshal turned toward the viscount, grateful for that praise of
his son, whilst the prince exclaimed:
NA
Meanwhile the prince took De Guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner
had been taken and who this young man was.
NA
a letter from my sister, Madame de Longueville; but I see that you have
NA
NA
highness in a conversation so important as that in which you were
NA
NA
NA
The prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sold their blood
to whoever would buy, and grew old in stratagems and spoils. Since he
had been taken he had not uttered a word, so that it was not known to
what country he belonged. The prince looked at him with unspeakable
distrust.
NA
The prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign tongue.
â€œAh! ah! it seems that he is a Spaniard. Do you speak Spanish,
NA
NA
NA
turning to those who were near him â€œcan any one of you speak Spanish and

Meanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no
understanding of what was taking place.
NA
purest Castilian.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA

Raoul began the examination, but the result justified his opinion. The
prisoner did not understand, or seemed not to understand, what Raoul
said to him; and Raoul could hardly understand his replies, containing a
mixture of Flemish and Alsatian. However, amidst all the prisonerâ€™s
efforts to elude a systematic examination, Raoul had recognized his
natural accent.
NA
The prisoner started and bit his lips.
NA
since he is Italian I will myself continue the examination. Thank you,
NA
NA
But the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in Italian than in
the other languages; his aim was to elude the examination. Therefore, he
knew nothing either of the enemyâ€™s numbers, or of those in command, or
of the purpose of the army.
NA
ignorance; â€œthe man was caught in the act of assassination and robbery;
he might have purchased his life by speaking; he doesnâ€™t wish to speak.
NA
The prisoner turned pale. The two soldiers who had brought him in took
him, each by one arm, and led him toward the door, whilst the prince,
turning to Marshal de Grammont, seemed to have already forgotten the
order he had given.
When he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner stopped. The
soldiers, who knew only their orders, attempted to force him along.

or shall send a courier directing you to bring them to me. Twenty

â€œChoose for yourself in my stables the horse you like best. No false
modesty; take the best horse you can find. You will need it this
NA
Raoul didnâ€™t wait to be told twice; he knew that with superiors,
especially when those superiors are princes, the highest politeness is
to obey without delay or argument; he went down to the stables, picked
out a pie-bald Andalusian horse, saddled and bridled it himself, for
Athos had advised him to trust no one with those important offices at a
time of danger, and went to rejoin the prince, who at that moment
mounted his horse.
NA
NA
Raoul handed the letter to the prince.
NA
The prince threw his bridle over the pommel of the saddle, as he was
wont to do when he wished to have both hands free, unsealed the letter
of Madame de Longueville and started at a gallop on the road to Lens,
attended by Raoul and his small escort, whilst messengers sent to recall
the troops set out with a loose rein in other directions. The prince
read as he hastened on.
NA
I have only to say, after the little that I have seen and heard, that I
NA
Raoul bowed.
Meanwhile, as the little troop drew nearer to Lens, the noise of the
cannon sounded louder. The prince kept his gaze fixed in the direction
of the sound with the steadfastness of a bird of prey. One would have
said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his
horizon. From time to time his nostrils dilated as if eager for the
smell of powder, and he panted like a horse.
At length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident they were
within a league of the field of battle, and at a turn of the road they
perceived the little village of Aunay.
The peasants were in great commotion. The report of Spanish cruelty had
gone out and every one was frightened. The women had already fled,
taking refuge in Vitry; only a few men remained. On seeing the prince
they hastened to meet him. One of them recognized him.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œTo some elevated spot whence I can look down on Lens and the
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAfoot, my lord; I have served always in the infantry. Besides, I expect
NA
NA
The peasant started off, running before the princeâ€™s horse; then, a
hundred steps from the village, he took a narrow road hidden at the
bottom of the valley. For a half league they proceeded thus, the
cannon-shot sounding so near that they expected at each discharge to
hear the hum of the balls. At length they entered a path which, going
out from the road, skirted the mountainside. The prince dismounted,
ordered one of his aids and Raoul to follow his example, and directed
the others to await his orders, keeping themselves meanwhile on the
alert. He then began to ascend the path.
In about ten minutes they reached the ruins of an old chateau; those
ruins crowned the summit of a hill which overlooked the surrounding
country. At a distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down
on Lens, at bay, and before Lens the enemyâ€™s entire army.
With a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay
before him, from Lens as far as Vimy. In a moment the plan of the battle
which on the following day was to save France the second time from
invasion was unrolled in his mind. He took a pencil, tore a page from
his tablets and wrote:
â€œMy Dear Marshal,--In an hour Lens will be in the enemyâ€™s possession.
Come and rejoin me; bring with you the whole army. I shall be at Vendin
to place it in position. To-morrow we shall retake Lens and beat the
NA
NA
NA
Raoul bowed, took the letter, went hastily down the mountain, leaped on
his horse and set out at a gallop. A quarter of an hour later he was
with the marshal.
A portion of the troops had already arrived and the remainder was
expected from moment to moment. Marshal de Grammont put himself at the
head of all the available cavalry and infantry and took the road to
Vendin, leaving the Duc de Chatillon to await and bring on the rest. All
the artillery was ready to move, and started off at a momentâ€™s notice.
It was seven oâ€™clock in the evening when the marshal arrived at the
appointed place. The prince awaited him there. As he had foreseen, Lens
had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after Raoulâ€™s
departure. The event was announced by the cessation of the firing.
As the shadows of night deepened the troops summoned by the prince
arrived in successive detachments. Orders were given that no drum should
be beaten, no trumpet sounded.
At nine oâ€™clock the night had fully come. Still a last ray of twilight
lighted the plain. The army marched silently, the prince at the head of
the column. Presently the army came in sight of Lens; two or three
houses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what
suffering was endured by a town taken by assault.
The prince assigned to every one his post. Marshal de Grammont was to
hold the extreme left, resting on Mericourt. The Duc de Chatillon
commanded the centre. Finally, the prince led the right wing, resting on
Aunay. The order of battle on the morrow was to be that of the positions
taken in the evening. Each one, on awaking, would find himself on the
field of battle.
The movement was executed in silence and with precision. At ten oâ€™clock
every one was in his appointed position; at half-past ten the prince
visited the posts and gave his final orders for the following day.
Three things were especially urged upon the officers, who were to see
that the soldiers observed them scrupulously: the first, that the
different corps should so march that cavalry and infantry should be on
the same line and that each body should protect its gaps; the second, to
go to the charge no faster than a walk; the third, to let the enemy fire
first.
The prince assigned the Count de Guiche to his father and kept
Bragelonne near his own person; but the two young men sought the
privilege of passing the night together and it was accorded them. A tent
was erected for them near that of the marshal.
Although the day had been fatiguing, neither of them was inclined to
sleep. And besides, even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is
a serious time; it was so with greater reason to two young men who were
about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle. On the
evening before a battle one thinks of a thousand things forgotten till
then; those who are indifferent to one another become friends and those
who are friends become brothers. It need not be said that if in the
depths of the heart there is a sentiment more tender, it reaches then,
quite naturally, the highest exaltation of which it is capable. Some
sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two
friends, for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an
end of the tent and began to write.
The letters were long--the four pages were covered with closely written
words. The writers sometimes looked up at each other and smiled; they
understood without speaking, their organizations were so delicate and
sympathetic. The letters being finished, each put his own into two
envelopes, so that no one, without tearing the first envelope, could
discover to whom the second was addressed; then they drew near to each
other and smilingly exchanged their letters.
NA
NA
They then embraced each other like two brothers, and each wrapping
himself in his cloak they soon passed into that kindly sleep of youth
which is the prerogative of birds, flowers and infants.
35. A Dinner in the Old Style.
The second interview between the former musketeers was not so formal and
threatening as the first. Athos, with his superior understanding, wisely
deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory
point of reunion, and at the moment when his friends, in deference to
his deportment and sobriety, dared scarcely speak of some of their
former good dinners, he was the first to propose that they should all
assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves
unreservedly to their own natural character and manners--a freedom which
had formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them
which gave them the name of the inseparables. For different reasons this
was an agreeable proposition to them all, and it was therefore agreed
that each should leave a very exact address and that upon the request of
any of the associates a meeting should be convoked at a famous eating
house in the Rue de la Monnaie, of the sign of the Hermitage. The first
rendezvous was fixed for the following Wednesday, at eight oâ€™clock in
the evening precisely.
On that day, in fact, the four friends arrived punctually at the hour,
each from his own abode or occupation. Porthos had been trying a new
horse; Dâ€™Artagnan was on guard at the Louvre; Aramis had been to visit
one of his penitents in the neighborhood; and Athos, whose domicile was
established in the Rue Guenegaud, found himself close at hand. They
were, therefore, somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of
the Hermitage, Athos starting out from the Pont Neuf, Porthos by the Rue
de la Roule, Dâ€™Artagnan by the Rue des Fosse Saint Germain lâ€™Auxerrois,
and Aramis by the Rue de Bethisy.
The first words exchanged between the four friends, on account of the
ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration, were
somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of stiffness.
Athos perceived this embarrassment, and by way of supplying an effectual
remedy, called for four bottles of champagne.
At this order, given in Athosâ€™s habitually calm manner, the face of the
Gascon relaxed and Porthosâ€™s brow grew smooth. Aramis was astonished. He
knew that Athos not only never drank, but more, that he had a kind of
repugnance to wine. This astonishment was doubled when Aramis saw Athos
fill a bumper and toss it off with all his former enthusiasm. His
companions followed his example. In a very few minutes the four bottles
were empty and this excellent specific succeeded in dissipating even the
slightest cloud that might have rested on their spirits. Now the four
friends began to speak loud, scarcely waiting till one had finished
before another began, and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at
the table. Soon--strange fact--Aramis undid two buttons of his doublet,
seeing which, Porthos unfastened his entirely.
Battles, long journeys, blows given and received, sufficed for the first
themes of conversation, which turned upon the silent struggles sustained
against him who was now called the great cardinal.

was invited by him to send him a list of the conditions on which he
would do him the honor to negotiate with him. The prince, who had a
great repugnance to treat with such an ill-bred fellow, made out a list,
against the grain, and sent it. In this list there were three conditions
which displeased Mazarin and he offered the prince ten thousand crowns

NA

him never to write to him again, and offered twenty thousand francs
more, on condition that he would never speak to him. What did Mazarin

anything; he thought they were fighting.
At last their hilarity calmed down and:

Well, I swear to you, all three, that had the executioner of
Bethune--was he not of Bethune?--yes, egad! of Bethune!--not been there,
I would have cut off the head of that infamous being without thinking of

NA
which he had assumed since he had belonged to the church and in which
there was more atheism than confidence in God, â€œwhat is the use of
thinking of it all? At the last hour we must confess this action and God
knows better than we can whether it is a crime, a fault, or a
meritorious deed. I repent of it? Egad! no. Upon my honor and by the

Just as the quaint conclusion reached by Porthos was about to bring back
hilarity to faces now more or less clouded, hasty footsteps were heard
upon the stair and some one knocked at the door.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
But Grimaud had already mounted the staircase and was waiting on the
last step; so springing into the room he motioned the host to leave it.
The door being closed, the four friends waited in expectation. Grimaudâ€™s
agitation, his pallor, the sweat which covered his face, the dust which
soiled his clothes, all indicated that he was the messenger of some
important and terrible news.

Athos glanced around at his friends with a melancholy smile. Porthos
turned to look at his sword, which was hanging on the wall; Aramis
seized his knife; Dâ€™Artagnan arose.
NA
â€œThat Miladyâ€™s son has left England, that he is in France, on his road
NA
NA
NA
This announcement was received in silence. Grimaud was so breathless, so
exhausted, that he had fallen back upon a chair. Athos filled a beaker
with champagne and gave it to him.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Grimaud rose.
NA
Disguised as a monk he discovered the whole history in confession from
the executioner of Bethune, and having confessed him, after having
learned everything from him, he gave him absolution by planting this
dagger into his heart. See, it is on fire yet with his hot blood, for it

And Grimaud threw the dagger on the table.
Dâ€™Artagnan, Porthos and Aramis rose and in one spontaneous motion rushed
to their swords. Athos alone remained seated, calm and thoughtful.

36. A Letter from Charles the First.
The reader must now cross the Seine with us and follow us to the door of
the Carmelite Convent in the Rue Saint Jacques. It is eleven oâ€™clock in
the morning and the pious sisters have just finished saying mass for the
success of the armies of King Charles I. Leaving the church, a woman and
a young girl dressed in black, the one as a widow and the other as an
orphan, have re-entered their cell.
The woman kneels on a prie-dieu of painted wood and at a short distance
from her stands the young girl, leaning against a chair, weeping.
The woman must have once been handsome, but traces of sorrow have aged
her. The young girl is lovely and her tears only embellish her; the lady
appears to be about forty years of age, the girl about fourteen.

As long as your brother was with me he kept me up; but he is gone and
can no longer send us news of himself, either to me or to your father. I

servants, who refused to accompany him unless I made this sacrifice. We

De Winter bowed again, unable to reply from excess of emotion.
On their side the mother and daughter retired into the embrasure of a
window to read eagerly the following letter:
â€œDear Wife,--We have now reached the moment of decision. I have
concentrated here at Naseby camp all the resources Heaven has left me,
and I write to you in haste from thence. Here I await the army of my
rebellious subjects. I am about to struggle for the last time with them.
If victorious, I shall continue the struggle; if beaten, I am lost. I
shall try, in the latter case (alas! in our position, one must provide
for everything), I shall try to gain the coast of France. But can they,
will they receive an unhappy king, who will bring such a sad story into
a country already agitated by civil discord? Your wisdom and your
affection must serve me as guides. The bearer of this letter will tell

37. Cromwellâ€™s Letter.
At the very moment when the queen quitted the convent to go to the
Palais Royal, a young man dismounted at the gate of this royal abode and
announced to the guards that he had something of importance to
communicate to Cardinal Mazarin. Although the cardinal was often
tormented by fear, he was more often in need of counsel and information,
and he was therefore sufficiently accessible. The true difficulty of
being admitted was not to be found at the first door, and even the
second was passed easily enough; but at the third watched, besides the
guard and the doorkeepers, the faithful Bernouin, a Cerberus whom no
speech could soften, no wand, even of gold, could charm.
It was therefore at the third door that those who solicited or were
bidden to an audience underwent their formal interrogatory.
The young man having left his horse tied to the gate in the court,
mounted the great staircase and addressed the guard in the first
chamber.

The young man appeared on the threshold of the ministerâ€™s closet, in one
hand holding his hat, in the other the letter. Mazarin rose. â€œHave you,

NA
Mazarin took the letter and read it thus:
â€œMr. Mordaunt, one of my secretaries, will remit this letter of
introduction to His Eminence, the Cardinal Mazarin, in Paris. He is also
the bearer of a second confidential epistle for his eminence.
NA
NA
NA
The young man drew from his pocket a second letter, presented it to the
cardinal, and took his seat. The cardinal, however, did not unseal the
letter at once, but continued to turn it again and again in his hand;
then, in accordance with his usual custom and judging from experience
that few people could hide anything from him when he began to question
them, fixing his eyes upon them at the same time, he thus addressed the
messenger:
â€œYou are very young, Monsieur Mordaunt, for this difficult task of

Mazarin now understood that Cromwellâ€™s envoy desired to retain his
incognito. He was silent for an instant, and during that time he scanned
the young man even more attentively than he had done at first. The
messenger was unmoved.
NA
NA
â€œI have one remaining. Three times I presented myself to ask his support

NA
Mazarin marked with surprise the diabolical expression with which the
young man uttered these words. Just as, ordinarily, faces are colored by
blood, his face seemed dyed by hatred and became livid.
â€œYour history is a terrible one, Mr. Mordaunt, and touches me keenly;
but happily for you, you serve an all-powerful master; he ought to aid

â€œMy lord, to a well-bred dog it is only necessary to show one end of a

NA
Mazarin, who was anxious to make a friend about Cromwellâ€™s person.
â€œThanks, my lord, I will speak to him myself. He will treat me better
NA
NA
NA
Mazarin looked at the young man, but at the fire which shot from his
glance he bent his head; then, embarrassed how to continue such a
conversation, he opened Cromwellâ€™s letter.
The young manâ€™s eyes gradually resumed their dull and glassy appearance
and he fell into a profound reverie. After reading the first lines of
the letter Mazarin gave a side glance at him to see if he was watching
the expression of his face as he read. Observing his indifference, he
shrugged his shoulders, saying:
â€œSend on your business those who do theirs at the same time! Let us see
NA
We here present the letter verbatim:
â€œTo his Eminence, Monseigneur le Cardinal Mazarini:
â€œI have wished, monseigneur, to learn your intentions relating to the
existing state of affairs in England. The two kingdoms are so near that
France must be interested in our situation, as we are interested in that
of France. The English are almost of one mind in contending against the
tyranny of Charles and his adherents. Placed by popular confidence at
the head of that movement, I can appreciate better than any other its
significance and its probable results. I am at present in the midst of
war, and am about to deliver a decisive battle against King Charles. I
shall gain it, for the hope of the nation and the Spirit of the Lord are
with me. This battle won by me, the king will have no further resources
in England or in Scotland; and if he is not captured or killed, he will
endeavor to pass over into France to recruit soldiers and to refurnish
himself with arms and money. France has already received Queen
Henrietta, and, unintentionally, doubtless, has maintained a centre of
inextinguishable civil war in my country. But Madame Henrietta is a
daughter of France and was entitled to the hospitality of France. As to
King Charles, the question must be viewed differently; in receiving and
aiding him, France will censure the acts of the English nation, and thus
so essentially harm England, and especially the well-being of the
government, that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced
NA
At this moment Mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter
was taking and paused to glance under his eyes at the young man. The
latter continued in thought. Mazarin resumed his reading:
â€œIt is important, therefore, monseigneur, that I should be informed as
to the intentions of France. The interests of that kingdom and those of
England, though taking now diverse directions, are very nearly the same.
England needs tranquillity at home, in order to consummate the expulsion
of her king; France needs tranquillity to establish on solid foundations
the throne of her young monarch. You need, as much as we do, that
interior condition of repose which, thanks to the energy of our
government, we are about to attain.
â€œYour quarrels with the parliament, your noisy dissensions with the
princes, who fight for you to-day and to-morrow will fight against you,
the popular following directed by the coadjutor, President Blancmesnil,
and Councillor Broussel--all that disorder, in short, which pervades the
several departments of the state, must lead you to view with uneasiness
the possibility of a foreign war; for in that event England, exalted by
the enthusiasm of new ideas, will ally herself with Spain, already
seeking that alliance. I have therefore believed, monseigneur, knowing
your prudence and your personal relation to the events of the present
time, that you will choose to hold your forces concentrated in the
interior of the French kingdom and leave to her own the new government
of England. That neutrality consists simply in excluding King Charles
from the territory of France and in refraining from helping him--a
stranger to your country--with arms, with money or with troops.
â€œMy letter is private and confidential, and for that reason I send it to
you by a man who shares my most intimate counsels. It anticipates,
through a sentiment which your eminence will appreciate, measures to be
taken after the events. Oliver Cromwell considered it more expedient to
declare himself to a mind as intelligent as Mazarinâ€™s than to a queen
admirable for firmness, without doubt, but too much guided by vain
prejudices of birth and of divine right.
â€œFarewell, monseigneur; should I not receive a reply in the space of
fifteen days, I shall presume my letter will have miscarried.

the dreamer, â€œmy reply to this letter will be more satisfactory to
General Cromwell if I am convinced that all are ignorant of my having
given one; go, therefore, and await it at Boulogne-sur-Mer, and promise

speak, when Bernouin entered hastily and bending down to the ear of the
cardinal, whispered:

Mazarin made a bound from his chair, which did not escape the attention
of the young man and suppressed the confidence he was about to make.

38. Henrietta Maria and Mazarin.
The cardinal rose, and advanced in haste to receive the queen of
England. He showed the more respect to this queen, deprived of every
mark of pomp and stripped of followers, as he felt some self-reproach
for his own want of heart and his avarice. But supplicants for favor
know how to accommodate the expression of their features, and the
daughter of Henry IV. smiled as she advanced to meet a man she hated and
despised.

And he threw an uneasy glance at his strong box; he even turned inside

every eye upon his hand, which indeed was white and handsome.

The cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face
to betray what he felt, and his smile remained as it ever was--false and
flattering; and when the queen finished speaking, he said:
â€œDo you think, madame, that France, agitated and disturbed as it is,
would be a safe retreat for a dethroned king? How will the crown, which
is scarce firmly set on the head of Louis XIV., support a double

The perspiration stood in large drops on Mazarinâ€™s brow.

returned Mazarin, without noticing the change of language offered to him
by the queen, â€œthat if the king, Charles I.--whom Heaven protect from
evil!--came into France, I would offer him my house--my own house; but,
alas! it would be but an unsafe retreat. Some day the people will burn
that house, as they burned that of the Marechal dâ€™Ancre. Poor Concino

for him; I have sold even to my last diamond to aid him. If I had had a

The queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her chair.

report it. Enough, sir, enough. I understand you or rather, I am wrong.

And with these words Henrietta rose in majestic indignation, whilst the
cardinal, raising his hands clasped toward her, exclaimed, â€œAh, madame,

But Queen Henrietta, without even turning toward him who made these
hypocritical pretensions, crossed the cabinet, opened the door for
herself and passing through the midst of the cardinalâ€™s numerous guards,
courtiers eager to pay homage, the luxurious show of a competing
royalty, she went and took the hand of De Winter, who stood apart in
isolation. Poor queen, already fallen! Though all bowed before her, as
etiquette required, she had now but a single arm on which she could
lean.

Bernouin went out and soon returned with Comminges, who was on guard.
NA
for whom you have asked, he approached the glass door of the gallery,
and gazed intently upon some object, doubtless the picture by Raphael,
which is opposite the door. He reflected for a second and then descended
the stairs. I believe I saw him mount a gray horse and leave the palace

NA

NA
Comminges had seen rightly, and Mordaunt had really acted as he had
related. In crossing the gallery parallel to the large glass gallery, he
perceived De Winter, who was waiting until the queen had finished her
negotiation.
At this sight the young man stopped short, not in admiration of
Raphaelâ€™s picture, but as if fascinated at the sight of some terrible
object. His eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body. One would
have said that he longed to break through the wall of glass which
separated him from his enemy; for if Comminges had seen with what an
expression of hatred the eyes of this young man were fixed upon De
Winter, he would not have doubted for an instant that the Englishman was
his eternal foe.
But he stopped, doubtless to reflect; for instead of allowing his first
impulse, which had been to go straight to Lord de Winter, to carry him
away, he leisurely descended the staircase, left the palace with his
head down, mounted his horse, which he reined in at the corner of the
Rue Richelieu, and with his eyes fixed on the gate, waited until the
queenâ€™s carriage had left the court.
He had not long to wait, for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an
hour with Mazarin, but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a
century to him. At last the heavy machine, which was called a chariot in
those days, came out, rumbling against the gates, and De Winter, still
on horseback, bent again to the door to converse with her majesty.
The horses started on a trot and took the road to the Louvre, which they
entered. Before leaving the convent of the Carmelites, Henrietta had
desired her daughter to attend her at the palace, which she had
inhabited for a long time and which she had only left because their
poverty seemed to them more difficult to bear in gilded chambers.
Mordaunt followed the carriage, and when he had watched it drive beneath
the sombre arches he went and stationed himself under a wall over which
the shadow was extended, and remained motionless, amidst the moldings of
Jean Goujon, like a bas-relievo, representing an equestrian statue.

king a conqueror, but to save him if conquered; and whatever Mazarin may

At this moment the door opened and the young Henrietta appeared; then
the queen, with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of
parents, repressed her tears and motioned to De Winter to change the
subject.
But that act of self-control, effective as it was, did not escape the
eyes of the young princess. She stopped on the threshold, breathed a
sigh, and addressing the queen:

count, Raoul could not help turning his glance toward the young
princess, and then he saw in her eyes an expression of infinite
gratitude to the young man; he no longer doubted that the daughter of
King Charles I. loved his friend.
NA
indeed; they can gain battles! Yes, the Marechal de Grammont is right;
this will change the aspect of French affairs, but I much fear it will
do nothing for English, even if it does not harm them. This is recent

De Winter made a gesture of surprise and the queen turned to him with a
start of joy.

As for De Winter he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright.

brave, a musketeer under Louis XIII., who must be now about forty-seven

Raoul bent respectfully before the two princesses, and bowing to De
Winter, departed.
The queen and De Winter continued to converse for some time in low
voices, in order that the young princess should not overhear them; but
the precaution was needless: she was in deep converse with her own
thoughts.
Then, when De Winter rose to take leave:

which came from my mother, and this order of St. Michael which came from
my husband. They are worth about fifty thousand pounds. I had sworn to
die of hunger rather than part with these precious pledges; but now that
this ornament may be useful to him or his defenders, everything must be
sacrificed. Take them, and if you need money for your expedition, sell
them fearlessly, my lord. But should you find the means of retaining
them, remember, my lord, that I shall esteem you as having rendered the
greatest service that a gentleman can render to a queen; and in the day
of my prosperity he who brings me this order and this cross shall be
NA
NA
devoted to you. I hasten to deposit these two objects in a safe place,
nor should I accept them if the resources of our ancient fortune were
left to us, but our estates are confiscated, our ready money is
exhausted, and we are reduced to turn to service everything we possess.
In an hour hence I shall be with the Comte de la Fere, and to-morrow

The queen tendered her hand to Lord de Winter, who, kissing it
respectfully, went out and traversed alone and unconducted those large,
dark and deserted apartments, brushing away tears which, blase as he was
by fifty years spent as a courtier, he could not withhold at the
spectacle of royal distress so dignified, yet so intense.
40. Uncle and Nephew.
The horse and servant belonging to De Winter were waiting for him at the
door; he proceeded toward his abode very thoughtfully, looking behind
him from time to him to contemplate the dark and silent frontage of the
Louvre. It was then that he saw a horseman, as it were, detach himself
from the wall and follow him at a little distance. In leaving the Palais
Royal he remembered to have observed a similar shadow.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI do not know, only he has followed your grace from the Palais Royal,
stopped at the Louvre to wait for you, and now leaves the Louvre with

And spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to
his hotel, situated near the Marais, for having for so long a time lived
near the Place Royale, Lord de Winter naturally returned to lodge near
his ancient dwelling.
The unknown spurred his horse to a gallop.
De Winter dismounted at his hotel and went up into his apartment,
intending to watch the spy; but as he was about to place his gloves and
hat on a table, he saw reflected in a glass opposite to him a figure
which stood on the threshold of the room. He turned around and Mordaunt
stood before him.
There was a moment of frozen silence between these two.

London--you dare not. As for denying that I am your nephew, you will

through the veins of him he thus addressed. â€œWhen I presented myself
before you for the first time in London, it was to ask you what had
become of my fortune; the second time it was to demand who had sullied

terrible than any other, to say to you as God said to the first
murderer: â€˜Cain, what hast thou done to thy brother Abel?â€™ My lord, what

De Winter fell back in a chair as though struck by a thunderbolt and in
vain attempted a reply.

assassinated her; my name would have secured me the paternal estate, you
have deprived me of it; you have despoiled me of my fortune. I am no
longer astonished that you knew me not. I am not surprised that you
refused to recognize me. When a man is a robber it is hard to call him
nephew whom he has impoverished; when one is a murderer, to recognize

These words produced a contrary effect to that which Mordaunt had
anticipated. De Winter remembered the monster that Milady had been; he
rose, dignified and calm, restraining by the severity of his look the
wild glance of the young man.
NA
then, so be it. Know, then, what manner of woman it was for whom to-day
you call me to account. That woman had, in all probability, poisoned my
brother, and in order to inherit from me she was about to assassinate me

â€œShe caused the unfortunate Duke of Buckingham to be stabbed by a man
who was, ere that, honest, good and pure. What say you to that crime, of

of her opponents poisoned in the convent of the Augustines at Bethune.

successive exclamations with constantly increasing force.
â€œAt last, charged with murders, with debauchery, hated by every one and
yet threatening still, like a panther thirsting for blood, she fell
under the blows of men whom she had rendered desperate, though they had
never done her the least injury; she met with judges whom her hideous
crimes had evoked; and that executioner you saw--that executioner who
you say told you everything--that executioner, if he told you
everything, told you that he leaped with joy in avenging on her his
brotherâ€™s shame and suicide. Depraved as a girl, adulterous as a wife,
an unnatural sister, homicide, poisoner, execrated by all who knew her,
by every nation that had been visited by her, she died accursed by

A sob which Mordaunt could not repress burst from his throat and his
livid face became suffused with blood; he clenched his fists, sweat
covered his face, his hair, like Hamletâ€™s, stood on end, and racked with
fury he cried out:
â€œSilence, sir! she was my mother! Her crimes, I know them not; her
disorders, I know them not; her vices, I know them not. But this I know,
that I had a mother, that five men leagued against one woman, murdered
her clandestinely by night--silently--like cowards. I know that you were
one of them, my uncle, and that you cried louder than the others: â€˜She
must die.â€™ Therefore I warn you, and listen well to my words, that they
may be engraved upon your memory, never to be forgotten: this murder,
which has robbed me of everything--this murder, which has deprived me of
my name--this murder, which has impoverished me--this murder, which has
made me corrupt, wicked, implacable--I shall summon you to account for
it first and then those who were your accomplices, when I discover
NA
With hatred in his eyes, foaming at his mouth, and his fist extended,
Mordaunt had advanced one more step, a threatening, terrible step,
toward De Winter. The latter put his hand to his sword, and said, with
the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death:
â€œWould you assassinate me, sir? Then I shall recognize you as my nephew,

NA
to resume their usual places and be calm; â€œno, I shall not kill you; at
least not at this moment, for without you I could not discover the
others. But when I have found them, then tremble, sir. I stabbed to the
heart the headsman of Bethune, without mercy or pity, and he was the

With these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with
sufficient calmness to pass unobserved; then upon the lowest landing
place he passed Tony, leaning over the balustrade, waiting only for a
call from his master to mount to his room.
But De Winter did not call; crushed, enfeebled, he remained standing and
with listening ear; then only when he had heard the step of the horse
going away he fell back on a chair, saying:

41. Paternal Affection.
Whilst this terrible scene was passing at Lord de Winterâ€™s, Athos,
seated near his window, his elbow on the table and his head supported on
his hand, was listening intently to Raoulâ€™s account of the adventures he
met with on his journey and the details of the battle.
Listening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure, the fine,
noble face of Athos betrayed indescribable pleasure; he inhaled the
tones of that young voice, as harmonious music. He forgot all that was
dark in the past and that was cloudy in the future. It almost seemed as
if the return of this much loved boy had changed his fears to hopes.
Athos was happy--happy as he had never been before.

the former musketeer.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œHe is a hero, sir. I did not lose sight of him for an instant. Oh! how
NA
NA
â€œAs calm as at parade, radiant as at a fete. When we went up to the
enemy it was slowly; we were forbidden to draw first and we were
marching toward the Spaniards, who were on a height with lowered
muskets. When we arrived about thirty paces from them the prince turned
around to the soldiers: â€˜Comrades,â€™ he said, â€˜you are about to suffer a
furious discharge; but after that you will make short work with those
fellows.â€™ There was such dead silence that friends and enemies could
have heard these words; then raising his sword, â€˜Sound trumpets!â€™ he

â€œWell, very good; you will do as much when the opportunity occurs, will

NA
â€œYes, sir; at that instant there was such a rataplan of musketry that
one might have imagined the infernal regions had opened. Those who were
not killed felt the heat of the flames. I opened my eyes, astonished to
find myself alive and even unhurt; a third of the squadron were lying on
the ground, wounded, dead or dying. At that moment I encountered the eye
of the prince. I had but one thought and that was that he was observing
NA
NA
â€œHe told me so, at least, sir, when he desired me to return to Paris
with Monsieur de Chatillon, who was charged to carry the news to the
queen and to bring the colors we had taken. â€˜Go,â€™ said he; â€˜the enemy
will not rally for fifteen days and until that time I have no need of
your service. Go and see those whom you love and who love you, and tell
my sister De Longueville that I thank her for the present that she made

smile of real affection, â€œfor I thought you would be glad to see me

Athos drew the young man toward him and pressed his lips to his brow, as
he would have done to a young daughter.

commander, and on the day of your return you have been received by two

Her Majesty the Queen of England, a gentleman who, when I pronounced
your name, uttered a cry of surprise and joy; he said he was a friend of

â€œI did not venture to ask, sir; he spoke elegantly, although I thought
NA
NA
be. Then, when he raised it again, he was struck by the presence of a
man who was standing at the open door and was gazing at him with a
compassionate air.
NA
NA
And the two gentlemen were for an instant locked in each otherâ€™s arms;
then Athos, looking into his friendâ€™s face and taking him by both hands,
said:
NA
â€œYes, truly, dear friend; and I may even say the sight of you increases
NA
And De Winter glancing around him, Raoul quickly understood that the two
friends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room unaffectedly.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Athos, again struck by this name, which seemed to pursue him like an
echo, hesitated for a moment, then slightly knitting his brows, he
calmly said:
â€œI know it, Grimaud met him between Bethune and Arras and then came here

the queen guessed rightly; we have been forestalled. Everything is clear

â€œHalloo, there, Grimaud, Olivain, and Blaisois! call the viscount and
NA
Blaisois was the tall youth, half groom, half peasant, whom we saw at
the Chateau de Bragelonne, whom Athos had christened by the name of his
province.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
De Winter shook him by the hand.
NA
NA
Grimaud shuddered, and nodding, awaited the departure, regarding the
butt of his musket with silent eloquence. Then obeying the orders given
him by Athos, he headed the small procession, bearing the torch in one
hand and the musket in the other, until it reached De Winterâ€™s inn, when
pounding on the portal with his fist, he bowed to my lord and faced
about without a word.
The same order was followed in returning, nor did Grimaudâ€™s searching
glance discover anything of a suspicious appearance, save a dark shadow,
as it were, in ambuscade, at the corner of the Rue Guenegaud and of the
Quai. He fancied, also, that in going he had already observed the street
watcher who had attracted his attention. He pushed on toward him, but
before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley, into
which Grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it.
The next day, on awaking, the count perceived Raoul by his bedside. The
young man was already dressed and was reading a new book by M.
Chapelain.
NA
NA
NA
NA
said Athos.
â€œSir, you will perhaps think that I am in a great hurry to leave you
NA
NA
NA
NA
almost a man, since you have made your first passage of arms, and have
NA
NA
you for a protector, shall I deem I have the right of freeing myself
from a guardianship so valuable to me. I have, however, a wish to go and

NA

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
one thing, and that is about the Duchess of Chevreuse, who was so kind

â€œAnd you ought to thank her, Raoul. Well, try the Hotel de Luynes,
Raoul, and ask if the duchess can receive you. I am glad to see you pay
attention to the usages of the world. You must take Grimaud and

Raoul went out, and when Athos heard his young, joyous voice calling to
Grimaud and Olivain, he sighed.
NA

not behind. He certainly likes the child, but will he love me less as

And Athos confessed to himself that, he was unprepared for so prompt a
departure; but Raoul was so happy that this reflection effaced
everything else from the consideration of his guardian.
Everything was ready at ten oâ€™clock for the departure, and as Athos was
watching Raoul mount, a groom rode up from the Duchess de Chevreuse. He
was charged to tell the Comte de la Fere, that she had learned of the
return of her youthful protege, and also the manner he had conducted
himself on the field, and she added that she should be very glad to
offer him her congratulations.
NA
NA
Then, with renewed instructions to Grimaud, Athos signified to Raoul
that he could set out, and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps
better that Raoul should be away from Paris at that moment.
42. Another Queen in Want of Help.
Athos had not failed to send early to Aramis and had given his letter to
Blaisois, the only serving-man whom he had left. Blaisois found Bazin
donning his beadleâ€™s gown, his services being required that day at Notre
Dame.
Athos had desired Blaisois to try to speak to Aramis himself. Blaisois,
a tall, simple youth, who understood nothing but what he was expressly
told, asked, therefore for the Abbe dâ€™Herblay, and in spite of Bazinâ€™s
assurances that his master was not at home, he persisted in such a
manner as to put Bazin into a passion. Blaisois seeing Bazin in clerical
guise, was a little discomposed at his denials and wanted to pass at all
risks, believing too, that the man with whom he had to do was endowed
with the virtues of his cloth, namely, patience and Christian charity.
But Bazin, still the servant of a musketeer, when once the blood mounted
to his fat cheeks, seized a broomstick and began belaboring Blaisois,
saying:

At this moment Aramis, aroused by this unusual disturbance, cautiously
opened the door of his room; and Blaisois, looking reproachfully at the
Cerberus, drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to Aramis.

into his room without even asking the cause of so much noise.
Blaisois returned disconsolate to the Hotel of the Grand Roi Charlemagne
and when Athos inquired if his commission was executed, he related his
adventure.
NA
NA
NA
At ten oâ€™clock Athos, with his habitual exactitude, was waiting on the
Pont du Louvre and was almost immediately joined by Lord de Winter.
They waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear Aramis was
not coming to join them.
NA
Rue du Bac, â€œpatience; I see an abbe cuffing a man, then bowing to a

It was indeed Aramis. Having run against a young shopkeeper who was
gaping at the crows and who had splashed him, Aramis with one blow of
his fist had distanced him ten paces.
At this moment one of his penitents passed, and as she was young and
pretty Aramis took off his cap to her with his most gracious smile.
A most affectionate greeting, as one can well believe took place between
him and Lord de Winter.

NA
NA
On arriving at the Louvre Lord de Winter entered first; indeed, there
was but one porter there to receive them at the gate.
It was impossible in daylight for the impoverished state of the
habitation grudging charity had conceded to an unfortunate queen to pass
unnoticed by Athos, Aramis, and even the Englishman. Large rooms,
completely stripped of furniture, bare walls upon which, here and there,
shone the old gold moldings which had resisted time and neglect, windows
with broken panes (impossible to close), no carpets, neither guards nor
servants: this is what first met the eyes of Athos, to which he,
touching his companionâ€™s elbow, directed his attention by his glances.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Athos smiled.
The queen appeared to be impatiently expecting them, for at the first
slight noise she heard in the hall leading to her room she came herself
to the door to receive these courtiers in the corridors of Misfortune.
NA
The gentlemen entered and remained standing, but at a motion from the
queen they seated themselves. Athos was calm and grave, but Aramis was
furious; the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes
examined every new trace of poverty that presented itself.

fastened by one button only, and I am always ready to become a musketeer
once more. This morning, being ignorant that I should have the honor of
seeing your majesty, I encumbered myself with this dress, but you will
find me none the less a man devoted to your majestyâ€™s service, in

in my service. To-day, look around you, and it may astonish you, that in
order to accomplish a plan which is dearer to me than life I have only

most miserable of queens, but the most unhappy of mothers, the most
wretched of wives. My children, two of them, at least, the Duke of York
and the Princess Elizabeth, are far away from me, exposed to the blows
of the ambitious and our foes; my husband, the king, is leading in
England so wretched an existence that it is no exaggeration to aver that
he seeks death as a thing to be desired. Hold! gentlemen, here is the

Obeying the queen, Athos read aloud the letter which we have already
seen, in which King Charles demanded to know whether the hospitality of
France would be accorded him.
NA
NA
The two friends exchanged a smile of contempt.
NA
from your majesty what you desire Monsieur dâ€™Herblay and myself to do in
NA
NA
gratitude; whilst Lord de Winter turned to her with a glance which said,
NA
NA
NA
even were it on to death, without demanding wherefore; but when it
NA
NA
NA
you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess
whom the whole world has abandoned, this is what is required to be done
for me. The king is alone with a few gentlemen, whom he fears to lose
every day; surrounded by the Scotch, whom he distrusts, although he be
himself a Scotchman. Since Lord de Winter left him I am distracted,
sirs. I ask much, too much, perhaps, for I have no title to request it.
Go to England, join the king, be his friends, protectors, march to
battle at his side, and be near him in his house, where conspiracies,
more dangerous than the perils of war, are hatching every day. And in
exchange for the sacrifice that you make, gentlemen, I promise--not to
reward you, I believe that word would offend you--but to love you as a
sister, to prefer you, next to my husband and my children, to every one.
NA
And the queen raised her eyes solemnly upward.
NA
NA
â€œYes, madame; only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in
engaging to load us with a friendship so far above our merit. We render
service to God, madame, in serving a prince so unfortunate, a queen so
NA
NA
for five years I have felt the least approach to joy or hope. God, who
can read my heart, all the gratitude I feel, will reward you! Save my
husband! Save the king, and although you care not for the price that is
placed upon a good action in this world, leave me the hope that we shall
meet again, when I may be able to thank you myself. In the meantime, I
remain here. Have you anything to ask of me? From this moment I become
your friend, and since you are engaged in my affairs I ought to occupy
NA
NA
NA
NA
The queen held out her hand, which they kissed, and she said in a low
tone to De Winter:
â€œIf you need money, my lord, separate the jewels I have given you;
detach the diamonds and sell them to some Jew. You will receive for them
fifty or sixty thousand francs; spend them if necessary, but let these

The queen had two letters ready, one written by herself, the other by
her daughter, the Princess Henrietta. Both were addressed to King
Charles. She gave the first to Athos and the other to Aramis, so that
should they be separated by chance they might make themselves known to
the king; after which they withdrew.
At the foot of the staircase De Winter stopped.

Gate Saint Denis. We will travel on horseback as far as our horses can
go and afterward we can take the post. Once more, let me thank you, my

The three gentlemen then shook hands, Lord de Winter taking the Rue
Saint Honore, and Athos and Aramis remaining together.

so much resemblance between us that I sometimes believe he is Aramis and
I am the coadjutor. This kind of life fatigues and oppresses me;
besides, he is a turbulent fellow, who will ruin our party. I am
convinced that if I gave him a box on the ear, such as I gave this
morning to the little citizen who splashed me, it would change the

as they are; besides, you are neither of you now your own masters; he
belongs to the Fronde and you to the queen of England. So, if the second
matter which you regret being unable to attend to is not more important

â€œUnfortunately, it is a thing that I canâ€™t perform at any time I choose.

NA
NA
NA
must part. I have one or two visits to make and a letter yet to write.
NA
NA
NA
They then separated. Athos went to pay a visit to Madame de Vendome,
left his name at Madame de Chevreuseâ€™s and wrote the following letter to
Dâ€™Artagnan:
â€œDear Friend,--I am about to set off with Aramis on important business.
I wished to make my adieux to you, but time does not permit. Remember
that I write to you now to repeat how much affection for you I still
cherish.
â€œRaoul is gone to Blois and is ignorant of my departure; watch over him
in my absence as much as you possibly can; and if by chance you receive
no news of me three months hence, tell him to open a packet which he
will find addressed to him in my bronze casket at Blois, of which I send
you now the key.
NA
At the hour agreed upon Aramis arrived; he was dressed as an officer and
had the old sword at his side which he had drawn so often and which he
was more than ever ready to draw.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œQuite; and now that I reflect about it, I am glad to leave Paris at

NA
Dâ€™Artagnan; but the rascal is so cunning, he might have guessed our

NA
NA
NA
â€œAnd I set off without waiting for one, but he called me back and gave
NA
golden jingle.
Athos opened it and began by drawing forth a little note, written in
these terms:
â€œMy dear Count,--When one travels, and especially for three months, one
never has a superfluity of money. Now, recalling former times of mutual
distress, I send you half my purse; it is money to obtain which I made
Mazarin sweat. Donâ€™t make a bad use of it, I entreat you.
â€œAs to what you say about not seeing you again, I believe not a word of
it; with such a heart as yours--and such a sword--one passes through the
valley of the shadow of death a dozen times, unscathed and unalarmed. Au
revoir, not farewell.
â€œIt is unnecessary to say that from the day I saw Raoul I loved him;
nevertheless, believe that I heartily pray that I may not become to him
a father, however much I might be proud of such a son.
â€œYour
â€œDâ€™Artagnan.
â€œP.S.--Be it well understood that the fifty louis which I send are

Athos smiled, and his fine eye was dimmed by a tear. Dâ€™Artagnan, who had
loved him so tenderly, loved him still, although a Mazarinist.

â€œI shall keep it, Aramis, and even though I had no need of it I still
should keep it. What is offered from a generous heart should be accepted
generously. Take twenty-five of them, Aramis, and give me the remaining

â€œAll right; I am glad to see you are of my opinion. There now, shall we

and therefore cannot leave Notre Dame.
â€œVery well, take Blaisois, with whom I know not what to do, since I

The two friends mounted, as did their servants. At the corner of the
Quai they encountered Bazin, who was running breathlessly.

NA
NA
NA
â€œYou know I have already told you that if you ever call me anything but

Aramis read the following epistle:
â€œMy dear Dâ€™Herblay,--I learned from Dâ€™Artagnan who has embraced me on
the part of the Comte de la Fere and yourself, that you are setting out
on a journey which may perhaps last two or three months; as I know that
you do not like to ask money of your friends I offer you some of my own
accord. Here are two hundred pistoles, which you can dispose of as you
wish and return to me when opportunity occurs. Do not fear that you put
me to inconvenience; if I want money I can send for some to any of my
chateaux; at Bracieux alone, I have twenty thousand francs in gold. So,
if I do not send you more it is because I fear you would not accept a
larger sum.
â€œI address you, because you know, that although I esteem him from my
heart I am a little awed by the Comte de la Fere; but it is understood
that what I offer you I offer him at the same time.
â€œI am, as I trust you do not doubt, your devoted

NA
â€œI say, my dear Dâ€™Herblay, that it is almost sacrilege to distrust
Providence when one has such friends, and therefore we will divide the

The division being made by the light of Bazinâ€™s taper, the two friends
continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined De
Winter at the Porte Saint Denis.

The three gentlemen took the road to Picardy, a road so well known to
them and which recalled to Athos and Aramis some of the most picturesque
adventures of their youth.

they had had a dispute with the paviers, â€œhow he would tremble at
passing this! Do you remember, Aramis, that it was here he received that

It was soon time for Grimaud to recall the past. Arriving before the inn
at which his master and himself had made such an enormous repast, he
approached Athos and said, showing him the airhole of the cellar:
NA
Athos began to laugh, for this juvenile escapade of his appeared to be
as amusing as if some one had related it of another person.
At last, after traveling two days and a night, they arrived at Boulogne
toward the evening, favored by magnificent weather. Boulogne was a
strong position, then almost a deserted town, built entirely on the
heights; what is now called the lower town did not then exist.
NA
do here as at Paris--let us separate to avoid suspicion. I know an inn,
little frequented, but of which the host is entirely devoted to me. I
will go there, where I expect to find letters, and you go to the first
tavern in the town, to Lâ€™Epee du Grand Henri for instance, refresh
yourselves, and in two hours be upon the jetty; our boat is waiting for

The matter being thus decided, the two friends found, about two hundred
paces further, the tavern indicated. Their horses were fed, but not
unsaddled; the grooms supped, for it was already late, and their two
masters, impatient to return, appointed a place of meeting with them on
the jetty and desired them on no account to exchange a word with any
one. It is needless to say that this caution concerned Blaisois
alone--long enough since it had been a useless one to Grimaud.
Athos and Aramis walked down toward the port. From their dress, covered
with dust, and from a certain easy manner by means of which a man
accustomed to travel is always recognizable, the two friends excited the
attention of a few promenaders. There was more especially one upon whom
their arrival had produced a decided impression. This man, whom they had
noticed from the first for the same reason they had themselves been
remarked by others, was walking in a listless way up and down the jetty.
From the moment he perceived them he did not cease to look at them and
seemed to burn with the wish to speak to them.
On reaching the jetty Athos and Aramis stopped to look at a little boat
made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to start.

NA

NA
NA
In truth, the walker, who, during the observations of the two friends,
had passed and repassed behind them several times, stopped at the name
of De Winter; but as his face betrayed no emotion at mention of this
name, it might have been by chance he stood so still.

NA
NA
They had reached the ladder which led to the boat. De Winter made the
grooms who carried the arms and the porters with the luggage descend
first and was about to follow them.
At this moment Athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to
the jetty, and hastening his steps, as if to reach the other side of the
port, scarcely twenty steps from the place of embarking. He fancied in
the darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned him.
Athos now descended the ladder in his turn, without losing sight of the
young man. The latter, to make a short cut, had appeared on a sluice.
NA
NA
And Athos sprang into the boat, which was immediately pushed off and
which soon sped seawards under the efforts of four stalwart rowers.
But the young man had begun to follow, or rather to advance before the
boat. She was obliged to pass between the point of the jetty, surmounted
by a beacon just lighted, and a rock which jutted out. They saw him in
the distance climbing the rock in order to look down upon the boat as it
passed.
NA
NA
NA
De Winter turned and followed the direction of Aramisâ€™s finger. The
beacon bathed with light the little strait through which they were about
to pass and the rock where the young man stood with bare head and
crossed arms.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The young man heard these words and bent so forward over the rock that
one might have supposed he was about to precipitate himself from it.
â€œYes, it is I, my uncle--I, the son of Milady--I, the monk--I, the
secretary and friend of Cromwell--I know you now, both you and your

In that boat sat three men, unquestionably brave, whose courage no man
would have dared dispute; nevertheless, at that voice, that accent and
those gestures, they felt a chill access of terror cramp their veins. As
for Grimaud, his hair stood on end and drops of sweat ran down his brow.

NA
important occasions he showed, he took one of the muskets from Tony,
shouldered and aimed it at the young man, who stood, like the accusing
angel, upon the rock.
NA
Athos threw himself on the muzzle of the gun and arrested the shot which
was about to be fired.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Grimaud, who had risen to watch the effect of the shot, fell back
hopeless, wringing his hands.
The young man burst into a laugh.
NA
His mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads, carried
by the breeze, until lost in the depths of the horizon. Aramis
shuddered.
NA
NA
NA
NA
De Winter only replied by a groan.
NA
NA
Athos took Lord de Winterâ€™s hand and tried to turn the conversation.

hear his words and made no reply.
NA
NA
Athos turned around with an effort; the sight of the young man was
evidently painful to him, and there he still was, in fact, on the rock,
the beacon shedding around him, as it were, a doubtful aureole.
NA
NA
NA
NA
At this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few
seconds later men, servants and baggage were aboard. The captain was
only waiting for his passengers; hardly had they put foot on deck ere
her head was turned towards Hastings, where they were to disembark. At
this instant the three friends turned, in spite of themselves, a last
look on the rock, upon the menacing figure which pursued them and now
stood out with a distinctness still. Then a voice reached them once
NA
44. Te Deum for the Victory of Lens.
The bustle which had been observed by Henrietta Maria and for which she
had vainly sought to discover a reason, was occasioned by the battle of
Lens, announced by the princeâ€™s messenger, the Duc de Chatillon, who had
taken such a noble part in the engagement; he was, besides, charged to
hang five and twenty flags, taken from the Lorraine party, as well as
from the Spaniards, upon the arches of Notre Dame.
Such news was decisive; it destroyed, in favor of the court, the
struggle commenced with parliament. The motive given for all the taxes
summarily imposed and to which the parliament had made opposition, was
the necessity of sustaining the honor of France and the uncertain hope
of beating the enemy. Now, since the affair of Nordlingen, they had
experienced nothing but reverses; the parliament had a plea for calling
Mazarin to account for imaginary victories, always promised, ever
deferred; but this time there really had been fighting, a triumph and a
complete one. And this all knew so well that it was a double victory for
the court, a victory at home and abroad; so that even when the young
king learned the news he exclaimed, â€œAh, gentlemen of the parliament, we
NA
royal child to her heart, whose haughty and unruly sentiments were in
such harmony with her own. A council was called on the same evening, but
nothing transpired of what had been decided on. It was only known that
on the following Sunday a Te Deum would be sung at Notre Dame in honor
of the victory of Lens.
The following Sunday, then, the Parisians arose with joy; at that period
a Te Deum was a grand affair; this kind of ceremony had not then been
abused and it produced a great effect. The shops were deserted, houses
closed; every one wished to see the young king with his mother, and the
famous Cardinal Mazarin whom they hated so much that no one wished to be
deprived of his presence. Moreover, great liberty prevailed throughout
the immense crowd; every opinion was openly expressed and chorused, so
to speak, of coming insurrection, as the thousand bells of all the Paris
churches rang out the Te Deum. The police belonging to the city being
formed by the city itself, nothing threatening presented itself to
disturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs
of slanderous lips.
Nevertheless, at eight oâ€™clock in the morning the regiment of the
queenâ€™s guards, commanded by Guitant, under whom was his nephew
Comminges, marched publicly, preceded by drums and trumpets, filing off
from the Palais Royal as far as Notre Dame, a manoeuvre which the
Parisians witnessed tranquilly, delighted as they were with military
music and brilliant uniforms.
Friquet had put on his Sunday clothes, under the pretext of having a
swollen face which he had managed to simulate by introducing a handful
of cherry kernels into one side of his mouth, and had procured a whole
holiday from Bazin. On leaving Bazin, Friquet started off to the Palais
Royal, where he arrived at the moment of the turning out of the regiment
of guards; and as he had only gone there for the enjoyment of seeing it
and hearing the music, he took his place at their head, beating the drum
on two pieces of slate and passing from that exercise to that of the
trumpet, which he counterfeited quite naturally with his mouth in a
manner which had more than once called forth the praises of amateurs of
imitative harmony.
This amusement lasted from the Barriere des Sergens to the place of
Notre Dame, and Friquet found in it very real enjoyment; but when at
last the regiment separated, penetrated the heart of the city and placed
itself at the extremity of the Rue Saint Christophe, near the Rue
Cocatrix, in which Broussel lived, then Friquet remembered that he had
not had breakfast; and after thinking in which direction he had better
turn his steps in order to accomplish this important act of the day, he
reflected deeply and decided that Councillor Broussel should bear the
cost of this repast.
In consequence he took to his heels, arrived breathlessly at the
councillorâ€™s door, and knocked violently.
His mother, the councillorâ€™s old servant, opened it.

Broussel heard the scream of the young oddity, and, enchanted with this
excess of zeal, came down to the first floor, for he was, in truth,
working in his room on the second.
NA
art thou not mad to make such a disturbance? Knowest thou not that it is
the custom of these soldiers to act thus and that it is usual for the

Friquet counterfeited surprise, and twisting his new cap around in his
fingers, said:
â€œIt is not astonishing for you to know it, Monsieur Broussel, who knows
everything; but as for me, by holy truth, I did not know it and I
thought I would give you good advice; you must not be angry with me for

â€œOn the contrary, my boy, on the contrary, I am pleased with your zeal.
Dame Nanette, look for those apricots which Madame de Longueville sent
to us yesterday from Noisy and give half a dozen of them to your son,
NA
NA
NA
Broussel then proceeded to his wifeâ€™s room and asked for breakfast; it
was nine oâ€™clock. The councillor placed himself at the window; the
street was completely deserted, but in the distance was heard, like the
noise of the tide rushing in, the deep hum of the populous waves
increasing now around Notre Dame.
This noise redoubled when Dâ€™Artagnan, with a company of musketeers,
placed himself at the gates of Notre Dame to secure the service of the
church. He had instructed Porthos to profit by this opportunity to see
the ceremony; and Porthos, in full dress, mounted his finest horse,
taking the part of supernumerary musketeer, as Dâ€™Artagnan had so often
done formerly. The sergeant of this company, a veteran of the Spanish
wars, had recognized Porthos, his old companion, and very soon all those
who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts
concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of Treville. Porthos had
not only been well received by the company, but he was moreover looked
on with great admiration.
At ten oâ€™clock the guns of the Louvre announced the departure of the
king, and then a movement, similar to that of trees in a stormy wind
that bend and writhe with agitated tops, ran though the multitude, which
was compressed behind the immovable muskets of the guard. At last the
king appeared with the queen in a gilded chariot. Ten other carriages
followed, containing the ladies of honor, the officers of the royal
household, and the court.
NA
gravely put his head out of the window, looked sufficiently grateful and
even bowed; at which the cries of the multitude were renewed.
Just as the court was settling down in the cathedral, a carriage,
bearing the arms of Comminges, quitted the line of the court carriages
and proceeded slowly to the end of the Rue Saint Christophe, now
entirely deserted. When it arrived there, four guards and a police
officer, who accompanied it, mounted into the heavy machine and closed
the shutters; then through an opening cautiously made, the policeman
began to watch the length of the Rue Cocatrix, as if he was waiting for
some one.
All the world was occupied with the ceremony, so that neither the
chariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had been
observed. Friquet, whose eye, ever on the alert, could alone have
discovered them, had gone to devour his apricots upon the entablature of
a house in the square of Notre Dame. Thence he saw the king, the queen
and Monsieur Mazarin, and heard the mass as well as if he had been on
duty.
Toward the end of the service, the queen, seeing Comminges standing near
her, waiting for a confirmation of the order she had given him before
quitting the Louvre, said in a whisper:
NA
Comminges immediately left the church and entered the Rue Saint
Christophe. Friquet, seeing this fine officer thus walk away, followed
by two guards, amused himself by pursuing them and did this so much the
more gladly as the ceremony ended at that instant and the king remounted
his carriage.
Hardly had the police officer observed Comminges at the end of the Rue
Cocatrix when he said one word to the coachman, who at once put his
vehicle into motion and drove up before Brousselâ€™s door. Comminges
knocked at the door at the same moment, and Friquet was waiting behind
Comminges until the door should be opened.

At this moment the door was opened, and having questioned the servant
the officer learned that Master Broussel was at home and at dinner.
Broussel was seated at the table with his family, having his wife
opposite to him, his two daughters by his side, and his son, Louvieres,
whom we have already seen when the accident happened to the
councillor--an accident from which he had quite recovered--at the bottom
of the table. The worthy man, restored to perfect health, was tasting
the fine fruit which Madame de Longueville had sent to him.
At sight of the officer Broussel was somewhat moved, but seeing him bow
politely he rose and bowed also. Still, in spite of this reciprocal
politeness, the countenances of the women betrayed a certain amount of
uneasiness; Louvieres became very pale and waited impatiently for the
officer to explain himself.

A thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people, so peacefully
assembled there, would not have produced a more appalling effect. It was
a horrible thing at that period to be imprisoned by the enmity of the
king. Louvieres sprang forward to snatch his sword, which stood against
a chair in a corner of the room; but a glance from the worthy Broussel,
who in the midst of it all did not lose his presence of mind, checked
this foolhardy action of despair. Madame Broussel, separated by the
width of the table from her husband, burst into tears, and the young
girls clung to their fatherâ€™s arms.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA

Comminges turned and saw Dame Nanette, her eyes flashing with anger and
a broom in her hand.
NA
â€œMe! keep quiet while my master is being arrested! he, the support, the
liberator, the father of the people! Ah! well, yes; you have to know me
NA
The latter smiled.
NA
NA
NA
NA
sprang to the window, threw it open, and in such a piercing voice that
it might have been heard in the square of Notre Dame:

NA
NA
NA
NA
the grasp of his two daughters and by a look restrain his son, who
seemed determined to dispute authority.

And she began to shriek more loudly, clinging to the bars of the window:
â€œHelp! help! for Master Broussel, who is arrested because he has

Comminges seized the servant around the waist and would have dragged her
from her post; but at that instant a treble voice, proceeding from a
kind of entresol, was heard screeching:
â€œMurder! fire! assassins! Master Broussel is being killed! Master
NA
It was Friquetâ€™s voice; and Dame Nanette, feeling herself supported,
recommenced with all her strength to sound her shrilly squawk.
Many curious faces had already appeared at the windows and the people
attracted to the end of the street began to run, first men, then groups,
and then a crowd of people; hearing cries and seeing a chariot they
could not understand it; but Friquet sprang from the entresol on to the
top of the carriage.
NA
NA
The crowd began to murmur and approached the house. The two guards who
had remained in the lane mounted to the aid of Comminges; those who were
in the chariot opened the doors and presented arms.
NA
The coachman turning around, gave Friquet a slash with his whip which
made him scream with pain.
NA
And regaining his entresol he overwhelmed the coachman with every
projectile he could lay hands on.
The tumult now began to increase; the street was not able to contain the
spectators who assembled from every direction; the crowd invaded the
space which the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear
between them and the carriage. The soldiers, pushed back by these living
walls, were in danger of being crushed against the spokes of the wheels
and the panels of the carriages. The cries which the police officer
NA
formidable multitude--seemed, on the contrary, to exasperate it still
NA
and seeing the uniforms ill-treated, he sprang into the scuffle sword in
hand, and brought unexpected help to the guards. This gentleman was a
young man, scarcely sixteen years of age, now white with anger. He
leaped from his charger, placed his back against the shaft of the
carriage, making a rampart of his horse, drew his pistols from their
holsters and fastened them to his belt, and began to fight with the back
sword, like a man accustomed to the handling of his weapon.
During ten minutes he alone kept the crowd at bay; at last Comminges
appeared, pushing Broussel before him.
NA
NA
NA
he, who, feeling himself pressed and almost crushed by a gigantic
citizen, pricked him with the point of his sword and sent him howling
back.
Comminges, so to speak, threw Broussel into the carriage and sprang in
after him. At this moment a shot was fired and a ball passed through the
hat of Comminges and broke the arm of one of the guards. Comminges
looked up and saw amidst the smoke the threatening face of Louvieres
appearing at the window of the second floor.

Friquet and Nanette continued to shout; the cries, the noise of the shot
and the intoxicating smell of powder produced their usual maddening
effects.

A terrible cry was heard, and the wife and daughters of Broussel held up
their hands in supplication to the people; the latter knew that this
officer, who was so pale, but who appeared so determined, would keep his
word; they continued to threaten, but they began to disperse.
NA
more dead than alive.
The man whipped his animals, which cleared a way through the crowd; but
on arriving on the Quai they were obliged to stop; the carriage was
upset, the horses carried off, stifled, mangled by the crowd. Raoul, on
foot, for he had not time to mount his horse again, tired, like the
guards, of distributing blows with the flat of his sword, had recourse
to its point. But this last and dreaded resource served only to
exasperate the multitude. From time to time a shot from a musket or the
blade of a rapier flashed among the crowd; projectiles continued to hail
down from the windows and some shots were heard, the echo of which,
though they were probably fired in the air, made all hearts vibrate.
Voices, unheard except on days of revolution, were distinguished; faces
were seen that only appeared on days of bloodshed. Cries of â€œDeath!
NA
all the noise, deafening as it was. Raoul, his hat in ribbons, his face
bleeding, felt not only his strength but also his reason going; a red
mist covered his sight, and through this mist he saw a hundred
threatening arms stretched over him, ready to seize upon him when he
fell. The guards were unable to help any one--each one was occupied with
his self-preservation. All was over; carriages, horses, guards, and
perhaps even the prisoner were about to be torn to shreds, when all at
once a voice well known to Raoul was heard, and suddenly a great sword
glittered in the air; at the same time the crowd opened, upset, trodden
down, and an officer of the musketeers, striking and cutting right and
left, rushed up to Raoul and took him in his arms just as he was about
to fall.
NA
NA
And he turned around, so stern with anger, strength and threat, that the
most excited rebels hustled back on one another, in order to escape, and

Comminges took his four guards and as many musketeers and ran to the
carriage, from which he made the people inside dismount, and brought
them to the vehicle which had upset. But when it was necessary to convey
the prisoner from one carriage to the other, the people, catching sight
of him whom they called their liberator, uttered every imaginable cry
and knotted themselves once more around the vehicle.

As the carriage started off the cries were redoubled and more than ten

started, brushed against the imprudent man, who thought by his strength
alone to stay the tempest, and he fell against the wall. Dâ€™Artagnan
pulled up his horse, and whilst his musketeers continued to charge, he
returned and bent with drawn sword over the man he had knocked down.

Then seeing that the musketeers had cleared the Quai from the Pont Neuf

Friquet heard perfectly, but he pretended not to do so and tried to
continue his road. Dâ€™Artagnan felt inclined for an instant to pursue
Master Friquet, but not wishing to leave Raoul alone he contented
himself with taking a pistol from the holster and cocking it.
Friquet had a quick eye and a fine ear. He saw Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s movement,
heard the sound of the click, and stopped at once.

Dâ€™Artagnan looked attentively at Friquet and recognized the little
chorister of the Rue de la Calandre.

Friquet, who did not expect to be let off so cheaply, bounded off like a
gazelle up the Quai a la Rue Dauphine, and disappeared. Raoul mounted
his horse, and both leisurely took their way to the Rue Tiquetonne.
Dâ€™Artagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own son.
They arrived without accident at the Hotel de la Chevrette.
The handsome Madeleine announced to Dâ€™Artagnan that Planchet had
returned, bringing Mousqueton with him, who had heroically borne the
extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would permit.
Dâ€™Artagnan desired Planchet to be summoned, but he had disappeared.

NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan rose, and taking a letter from his writing-desk, presented it
to Raoul. The face of the latter became serious when he had cast his
eyes upon the paper.
NA
NA
NA
â€œBut this letter seems to intimate that he is about to incur danger,

Porthos swallowed the second glass with the same grace with which he had
imbibed the first, took his beaver and followed Dâ€™Artagnan. As for
Raoul, he remained bewildered with what he had seen, having been
forbidden by Dâ€™Artagnan to leave the room until the tumult was over.
45. The Beggar of St. Eustache.
Dâ€™Artagnan had calculated that in not going at once to the Palais Royal
he would give Comminges time to arrive before him, and consequently to
make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he,
Dâ€™Artagnan, and his friend had rendered to the queenâ€™s party in the
morning.
They were indeed admirably received by Mazarin, who paid them numerous
compliments, and announced that they were more than half on their way to
obtain what they desired, namely, Dâ€™Artagnan his captaincy, Porthos his
barony.
Dâ€™Artagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk, for
he knew well that to Mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to perform.
But, though he held the cardinalâ€™s promises as of little worth, he
affected to be completely satisfied, for he was unwilling to discourage
Porthos.
Whilst the two friends were with the cardinal, the queen sent for him.
Mazarin, thinking that it would be the means of increasing the zeal of
his two defenders if he procured them personal thanks from the queen,
motioned them to follow him. Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos pointed to their
dusty and torn dresses, but the cardinal shook his head.
NA

NA
Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos obeyed. The court of Anne of Austria was full of
gayety and animation; for, after having gained a victory over the
Spaniard, it had just gained another over the people. Broussel had been
conducted out of Paris without further resistance, and was at this time
in the prison of Saint Germain; while Blancmesnil, who was arrested at
the same time, but whose arrest had been made without difficulty or
noise, was safe in the Castle of Vincennes.
Comminges was near the queen, who was questioning him upon the details
of his expedition, and every one was listening to his account, when
Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos were perceived at the door, behind the cardinal.

should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at Saint

â€œThese names are too numerous for me to remember them all, and I will

bowed. At this moment the coadjutor was announced; a cry of surprise ran
through the royal assemblage. Although the coadjutor had preached that
same morning it was well known that he leaned much to the side of the
Fronde; and Mazarin, in requesting the archbishop of Paris to make his
nephew preach, had evidently had the intention of administering to
Monsieur de Retz one of those Italian kicks he so much enjoyed giving.
The fact was, in leaving Notre Dame the coadjutor had learned the event
of the day. Although almost engaged to the leaders of the Fronde he had
not gone so far but that retreat was possible should the court offer him
the advantages for which he was ambitious and to which the coadjutorship
was but a stepping-stone. Monsieur de Retz wished to become archbishop
in his uncleâ€™s place, and cardinal, like Mazarin; and the popular party
could with difficulty accord him favors so entirely royal. He therefore
hastened to the palace to congratulate the queen on the battle of Lens,
determined beforehand to act with or against the court, as his
congratulations were well or ill received.
The coadjutor possessed, perhaps, as much wit as all those put together
who were assembled at the court to laugh at him. His speech, therefore,
was so well turned, that in spite of the great wish felt by the
courtiers to laugh, they could find no point on which to vent their
ridicule. He concluded by saying that he placed his feeble influence at
her majestyâ€™s command.
During the whole time he was speaking, the queen appeared to be well
pleased with the coadjutorâ€™s harangue; but terminating as it did with
such a phrase, the only one which could be caught at by the jokers, Anne
turned around and directed a glance toward her favorites, which
announced that she delivered up the coadjutor to their tender mercies.
Immediately the wits of the court plunged into satire. Nogent-Beautin,
the fool of the court, exclaimed that â€œthe queen was very happy to have
NA
of laughter. The Count de Villeroy said that â€œhe did not know how any
fear could be entertained for a moment, when the court had, to defend
itself against the parliament and the citizens of Paris, his holiness
the coadjutor, who by a signal could raise an army of curates, church
NA
The Marechal de la Meilleraie added that in case the coadjutor should
appear on the field of battle it would be a pity that he should not be
distinguished in the melee by wearing a red hat, as Henry IV. had been
distinguished by his white plume at the battle of Ivry.
During this storm, Gondy, who had it in his power to make it most
unpleasant for the jesters, remained calm and stern. The queen at last
asked him if he had anything to add to the fine discourse he had just
made to her.
NA
NA
The queen turned her back and the laughing recommenced.
The coadjutor bowed and left the palace, casting upon the cardinal such
a glance as is best understood by mortal foes. That glance was so sharp
that it penetrated the heart of Mazarin, who, reading in it a
declaration of war, seized Dâ€™Artagnan by the arm and said:
â€œIf occasion requires, monsieur, you will remember that man who has just
NA
NA
said he, â€œthis has a bad look. I dislike these quarrels among men of the
NA
Gondy withdrew, distributing benedictions on his way, and finding a
malicious satisfaction in causing the adherents of his foes to prostrate
themselves at his feet.
NA
court! faithless court! cowardly court! I will teach you how to laugh
NA
But whilst they were indulging in extravagant joy at the Palais Royal,
to increase the hilarity of the queen, Mazarin, a man of sense, and
whose fear, moreover, gave him foresight, lost no time in making idle
and dangerous jokes; he went out after the coadjutor, settled his
account, locked up his gold, and had confidential workmen to contrive
hiding places in his walls.
On his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had come
in after his departure and was waiting for him; he started with delight
when, on demanding the name of this young man, he learned that it was
Louvieres. He hastened to his cabinet. Brousselâ€™s son was there, still
furious, and still bearing bloody marks of his struggle with the kingâ€™s
officers. The only precaution he had taken in coming to the
archbishopric was to leave his arquebuse in the hands of a friend.
The coadjutor went to him and held out his hand. The young man gazed at
him as if he would have read the secret of his heart.
NA
NA
NA

â€œIn that case, my lord, the time for words has passed and the hour for
action is at hand; my lord, in three days, if you wish it, my father

The coadjutor started.

you have done for the last six months, out of pure Christian charity;
that would be too grand. You are ambitious--it is natural; you are a man
of genius and you know your worth. As for me, I hate the court and have
but one desire at this moment--vengeance. Give us the clergy and the
people, of whom you can dispose, and I will bring you the citizens and
the parliament; with these four elements Paris is ours in a week; and
believe me, monsieur coadjutor, the court will give from fear what it

It was now the coadjutorâ€™s turn to fix his piercing eyes on Louvieres.
â€œBut, Monsieur Louvieres, are you aware that it is simply civil war you

When once more alone Gondy sent to summon all the curates with whom he
had any connection to his house. Two hours later, thirty officiating
ministers from the most populous, and consequently the most disturbed
parishes of Paris had assembled there. Gondy related to them the insults
he had received at the Palais Royal and retailed the jests of Beautin,
the Count de Villeroy and Marechal de la Meilleraie. The curates asked
him what was to be done.
NA
consciences. Well, undermine in them the miserable prejudice of respect
and fear of kings; teach your flocks that the queen is a tyrant; and
repeat often and loudly, so that all may know it, that the misfortunes
of France are caused by Mazarin, her lover and her destroyer; begin this
work to-day, this instant even, and in three days I shall expect the
result. For the rest, if any one of you have further or better counsel

Three curates remained--those of St. Merri, St. Sulpice and St.

Gondy dressed himself as an officer, put on a felt cap with a red
feather, hung on a long sword, buckled spurs to his boots, wrapped
himself in an ample cloak and followed the curate.
The coadjutor and his companion passed through all the streets lying
between the archbishopric and the St. Eustache Church, watching
carefully to ascertain the popular feeling. The people were in an
excited mood, but, like a swarm of frightened bees, seemed not to know
at what point to concentrate; and it was very evident that if leaders of
the people were not provided all this agitation would pass off in idle
buzzing.
On arriving at the Rue des Prouvaires, the curate pointed toward the
square before the church.
NA
Gondy looked at the spot indicated and perceived a beggar seated in a
chair and leaning against one of the moldings; a little basin was near
him and he held a holy water brush in his hand.
NA
â€œNo, my lord; these places are bought. I believe this man paid his

NA
â€œSome of those men sometimes die worth twenty thousand and twenty-five
NA
NA
NA
In the meantime they were advancing toward the square, and the moment
the coadjutor and the curate put their feet on the first church step the
mendicant arose and proffered his brush.
He was a man between sixty-six and sixty-eight years of age, little,
rather stout, with gray hair and light eyes. His countenance denoted the
struggle between two opposite principles--a wicked nature, subdued by
determination, perhaps by repentance.
He started on seeing the cavalier with the curate. The latter and the
coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the
sign of the cross; the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat,
which was on the ground.
NA
NA
NA
NA
There was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite
disguise and which astonished the coadjutor.
NA

The mendicant shook his head.
â€œThese are melancholy doings, your reverence, which always fall again

46. The Tower of St. Jacques de la Boucherie.
At a quarter to six oâ€™clock, Monsieur de Gondy, having finished his
business, returned to the archiepiscopal palace.
At six oâ€™clock the curate of St. Merri was announced.
The coadjutor glanced rapidly behind and saw that he was followed by
another man. The curate then entered, followed by Planchet.
NA
NA
Planchet saluted in the manner of one accustomed to fine houses.

Gondy went to a box and drew forth a bag.
NA
NA
NA
Planchet, putting the bag under his arm.
NA
NA
Planchet went out, the curate remaining for a moment.
NA
NA
NA
NA
The curate rejoined Planchet, who was waiting for him on the stairs. Ten
minutes later the curate of St. Sulpice was announced. As soon as the
door of Gondyâ€™s study was opened a man rushed in. It was the Count de
Rochefort.
NA
NA
NA
â€œLet us say no more on the subject; you tell me so, I believe you. Well,

NA
NA
NA
â€œYou may reckon upon me and upon fifty soldiers which the Chevalier

It was half-past nine oâ€™clock and the coadjutor required half an hour to
go from the archbishopâ€™s palace to the tower of St. Jacques de la

He knocked and the door was opened. The vicar himself awaited him,
conducted him to the top of the tower, and when there pointed to a
little door, placed the light which he had brought with him in a corner
of the wall, that the coadjutor might be able to find it on his return,
and went down again. Although the key was in the door the coadjutor
knocked.

NA
NA
There were three candles alight, each of which burnt before a window,
one looking upon the city, the other upon the Palais Royal, and a third
upon the Rue Saint Denis.
The man went silently to each of the candles and blew them out one after
the other.

The man took the bag from the hands of the coadjutor, who heard the

The mendicant sighed and threw down the bag.

His face was pale and drawn, like that of a man who had just undergone

turning around he saw the beggar between him and the door. His first
idea was that this man intended to do him some harm, but on the contrary
he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped.

47. The Riot.
It was about eleven oâ€™clock at night. Gondy had not walked a hundred
steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the
streets of Paris.
The whole city seemed peopled with fantastic beings; silent shadows were
seen unpaving the streets and others dragging and upsetting great
wagons, whilst others again dug ditches large enough to ingulf whole
regiments of horsemen. These active beings flitted here and there like
so many demons completing some unknown labor; these were the beggars of
the Court of Miracles--the agents of the giver of holy water in the
Square of Saint Eustache, preparing barricades for the morrow.
Gondy gazed on these deeds of darkness, on these nocturnal laborers,
with a kind of fear; he asked himself, if, after having called forth
these foul creatures from their dens, he should have the power of making
them retire again. He felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of
these beings happened to approach him. He reached the Rue Saint Honore
and went up it toward the Rue de la Ferronnerie; there the aspect
changed; here it was the tradesmen who were running from shop to shop;
their doors seemed closed like their shutters, but they were only pushed
to in such a manner as to open and allow the men, who seemed fearful of
showing what they carried, to enter, closing immediately. These men were
shopkeepers, who had arms to lend to those who had none.
One individual went from door to door, bending under the weight of
swords, guns, muskets and every kind of weapon, which he deposited as
fast as he could. By the light of a lantern the coadjutor recognized
Planchet.
The coadjutor proceeded onward to the quay by way of the Rue de la
Monnaie; there he found groups of bourgeois clad in black cloaks or
gray, according as they belonged to the upper or lower bourgeoisie. They
were standing motionless, while single men passed from one group to
another. All these cloaks, gray or black, were raised behind by the
point of a sword, or before by the barrel of an arquebuse or a musket.
On reaching the Pont Neuf the coadjutor found it strictly guarded and a
man approached him.
NA
â€œThen it is because you do not know your friends, my dear Monsieur
NA
Louvieres recognized him and bowed.
Gondy continued his way and went as far as the Tour de Nesle. There he
saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the walls. They might be
said to be a procession of ghosts, for they were all wrapped in white
cloaks. When they reached a certain spot these men appeared to be
annihilated, one after the other, as if the earth had opened under their
feet. Gondy, edged into a corner, saw them vanish from the first until
the last but one. The last raised his eyes, to ascertain, doubtless,
that neither his companions nor himself had been watched, and, in spite
of the darkness, he perceived Gondy. He walked straight up to him and
placed a pistol to his throat.
NA
NA
Rochefort recognized the voice.
NA
â€œThe very same. What people are you leading thus into the bowels of the
NA
â€œMy fifty recruits from the Chevalier dâ€™Humieres, who are destined to
enter the light cavalry and who have only received as yet for their

NA

NA
his turn and closed the trap after him.
It was now one oâ€™clock in the morning and the coadjutor returned home.
He opened a window and leaned out to listen. A strange,
incomprehensible, unearthly sound seemed to pervade the whole city; one
felt that something unusual and terrible was happening in all the
streets, now dark as oceanâ€™s most unfathomable caves. From time to time
a dull sound was heard, like that of a rising tempest or a billow of the
sea; but nothing clear, nothing distinct, nothing intelligible; it was
like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an earthquake.
The work of revolt continued the whole night thus. The next morning, on
awaking, Paris seemed to be startled at her own appearance. It was like
a besieged town. Armed men, shouldering muskets, watched over the
barricades with menacing looks; words of command, patrols, arrests,
executions, even, were encountered at every step. Those bearing plumed
NA
NA
was hooted at, spat upon and even beaten. They had not yet begun to
slay, but it was well felt that the inclination to do so was not
wanting.
The barricades had been pushed as far as the Palais Royal. From the Rue
de Bons Enfants to that of the Ferronnerie, from the Rue Saint
Thomas-du-Louvre to the Pont Neuf, from the Rue Richelieu to the Porte
Saint Honore, there were more than ten thousand armed men; those who
were at the front hurled defiance at the impassive sentinels of the
regiment of guards posted around the Palais Royal, the gates of which
were closed behind them, a precaution which made their situation
precarious. Among these thousands moved, in bands numbering from one
hundred to two hundred, pale and haggard men, clothed in rags, who bore
a sort of standard on which was inscribed these words: â€œBehold the
NA
heard; and there were so many of these bands that the cries were to be
heard in all directions.
The astonishment of Mazarin and of Anne of Austria was great when it was
announced to them that the city, which the previous evening they had
left entirely tranquil, had awakened to such feverish commotion; nor
would either the one or the other believe the reports that were brought
to them, declaring they would rather rely on the evidence of their own
eyes and ears. Then a window was opened and when they saw and heard they
were convinced.
Mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace;
but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet, trembling all over,
locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds
on his fingers. As for the queen, furious, and left to her own guidance,
she went for the Marechal de la Meilleraie and desired him to take as
many men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this
pleasantry.
The marshal was ordinarily very adventurous and was wont to hesitate at
nothing; and he had that lofty contempt for the populace which army
officers usually profess. He took a hundred and fifty men and attempted
to go out by the Pont du Louvre, but there he met Rochefort and his
fifty horsemen, attended by more than five hundred men. The marshal made
no attempt to force that barrier and returned up the quay. But at Pont
Neuf he found Louvieres and his bourgeois. This time the marshal
charged, but he was welcomed by musket shots, while stones fell like
hail from all the windows. He left there three men.
He beat a retreat toward the market, but there he met Planchet with his
halberdiers; their halberds were leveled at him threateningly. He
attempted to ride over those gray cloaks, but the gray cloaks held their
ground and the marshal retired toward the Rue Saint Honore, leaving four
of his guards dead on the field of battle.
The marshal then entered the Rue Saint Honore, but there he was opposed
by the barricades of the mendicant of Saint Eustache. They were guarded,
not only by armed men, but even by women and children. Master Friquet,
the owner of a pistol and of a sword which Louvieres had given him, had
organized a company of rogues like himself and was making a tremendous
racket.
The marshal thought this barrier not so well fortified as the others and
determined to break through it. He dismounted twenty men to make a
breach in the barricade, whilst he and others, remaining on their
horses, were to protect the assailants. The twenty men marched straight
toward the barrier, but from behind the beams, from among the
wagon-wheels and from the heights of the rocks a terrible fusillade
burst forth and at the same time Planchetâ€™s halberdiers appeared at the
corner of the Cemetery of the Innocents, and Louvieresâ€™s bourgeois at
the corner of the Rue de la Monnaie.
The Marechal de la Meilleraie was caught between two fires, but he was
brave and made up his mind to die where he was. He returned blow for
blow and cries of pain began to be heard in the crowd. The guards, more
skillful, did greater execution; but the bourgeois, more numerous,
overwhelmed them with a veritable hurricane of iron. Men fell around him
as they had fallen at Rocroy or at Lerida. Fontrailles, his
aide-de-camp, had an arm broken; his horse had received a bullet in his
neck and he had difficulty in controlling him, maddened by pain. In
short, he had reached that supreme moment when the bravest feel a
shudder in their veins, when suddenly, in the direction of the Rue de
NA
Gondy, in surplice and cloak, appeared, moving tranquilly in the midst
of the fusillade and bestowing his benedictions to the right and left,
as undisturbed as if he were leading a procession of the Fete Dieu.
All fell to their knees. The marshal recognized him and hastened to meet
him.
NA
NA
A great tumult arose, in the midst of which even the noise of thunder
could not have been heard. Gondy raised his hand and demanded silence.
All were still.
NA
whose intentions you have been deceived and who pledges himself, on
returning to the Louvre, to demand of the queen, in your name, our
NA
turning to La Meilleraie.
NA
NA
NA
The marshal raised his hand in token of assent.
NA
NA
NA
The crowd gave place, the barricade was opened, and the marshal, with
the remnant of his company, retreated, preceded by Friquet and his
bandits, some of them making a presence of beating drums and others
imitating the sound of the trumpet. It was almost a triumphal
procession; only, behind the guards the barricades were closed again.
The marshal bit his fingers.
In the meantime, as we have said, Mazarin was in his closet, putting his
affairs in order. He called for Dâ€™Artagnan, but in the midst of such
tumult he little expected to see him, Dâ€™Artagnan not being on service.
In about ten minutes Dâ€™Artagnan appeared at the door, followed by the
inseparable Porthos.
NA
NA
NA
his head. â€œThe town is in open revolt, and just now, as I was crossing
the Rue Montorgueil with Monsieur du Vallon, who is here, and is your
humble servant, they wanted in spite of my uniform, or perhaps because
of my uniform, to make us cry â€˜Long live Broussel!â€™ and must I tell you,
NA
NA
NA
Mazarin smiled, but became very pale.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
And Dâ€™Artagnan displayed four gunshot holes in his cloak and two in his
beaver. As for Porthosâ€™s coat, a blow from a halberd had cut it open on
the flank and a pistol shot had cut his feather in two.
NA
NA
At this moment the tumult was heard nearer.
Mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around him. He had a great desire
to go to the window, but he dared not.
NA
NA
he, â€œwhat is this? Marechal de la Meilleraie returning without a
hat--Fontrailles with his arm in a sling--wounded guards--horses
bleeding; eh, then, what are the sentinels about? They are aiming--they
NA
â€œThey have received orders to fire on the people if the people approach
NA
NA
NA
â€œThe gates! to hold for five minutes--the gates, they will be torn down,
NA
screamed Dâ€™Artagnan, throwing open the window.
In spite of this recommendation, which, owing to the noise, could
scarcely have been heard, two or three musket shots resounded, succeeded
by a terrible discharge. The balls might be heard peppering the facade
of the Palais Royal, and one of them, passing under Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s arm,
entered and broke a mirror, in which Porthos was complacently admiring
himself.
NA
NA
worth while weeping yet, for probably an hour hence there will not be
one of your mirrors remaining in the Palais Royal, whether they be
NA
NA
â€œEh, egad, to give up Broussel as they demand! What the devil do you
want with a member of the parliament? He is of no earthly use to
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
He stopped at the end of the corridor and said:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
And turning off he entered the drawing-room by another door.
48. The Riot becomes a Revolution.
The closet into which Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos had been ushered was
separated from the drawing-room where the queen was by tapestried
curtains only, and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that
passed in the adjoining room, whilst the aperture between the two
hangings, small as it was, permitted them to see.
The queen was standing in the room, pale with anger; her self-control,
however, was so great that it might have been imagined that she was
calm. Comminges, Villequier and Guitant were behind her and the women
again were behind the men. The Chancellor Sequier, who twenty years
previously had persecuted her so ruthlessly, stood before her, relating
how his carriage had been smashed, how he had been pursued and had
rushed into the Hotel dâ€™O----, that the hotel was immediately invaded,
pillaged and devastated; happily he had time to reach a closet hidden
behind tapestry, in which he was secreted by an old woman, together with
his brother, the Bishop of Meaux. Then the danger was so imminent, the
rioters came so near, uttering such threats, that the chancellor thought
his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest, so
as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered. Fortunately,
however, he had not been taken; the people, believing that he had
escaped by some back entrance, retired and left him at liberty to
retreat. Then, disguised in the clothes of the Marquis dâ€™O----, he had
left the hotel, stumbling over the bodies of an officer and two guards
who had been killed whilst defending the street door.
During the recital Mazarin entered and glided noiselessly up to the
queen to listen.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The chancellor reddened and stammered some words.
NA
NA
NA
NA
The queen, although already pale, became visibly paler and her face was
contracted.
NA
At this moment steps were heard in the ante-room and without any
announcement the Marechal de la Meilleraie appeared at the door.
NA
NA
NA

at the door of your palace--fifteen in all. I have brought away ten or
twelve wounded. I know not where I have left my hat, and in all
probability I should have been left with my hat, had the coadjutor not

NA
â€œYes, madame; but I only came back on one condition--that I would

The irony with which these words were uttered did not escape the
marechal.
NA
probably, therefore, I do not quite comprehend the value of certain
words; I ought to have said the wishes, and not the will, of the people.
As for what you do me the honor to say, I presume you mean I was
NA
The queen smiled.
â€œWell, then, madame, yes, I did feel fear; and though I have been
through twelve pitched battles and I cannot count how many charges and
skirmishes, I own for the third time in my life I was afraid. Yes, and I
would rather face your majesty, however threatening your smile, than
face those demons who accompanied me hither and who sprung from I know

â€œMadame, I have pledged my word, and unless you order me to be arrested

Anne of Austriaâ€™s eyes shot glances of fire.
NA
NA
Mazarin sprang forward.
NA
â€œWould it be to give up Broussel, sir? If so, you can spare yourself the
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA

NA
queen, in a low voice.
Mazarin bowed.
NA
NA
NA
NA
The fiery Spanish woman spoke in a tone so imperative that the marechal
made no reply; he bowed and went out.
NA
NA
In the meantime Anne of Austria approached Comminges and conversed with
him in a subdued tone, whilst Mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner
occupied by Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos. Ere long the door opened and the
marechal entered, followed by the coadjutor.
NA
NA
The queen advanced a few steps to meet him, and then stopped, cold,
severe, unmoved, with her lower lip scornfully protruded.
Gondy bowed respectfully.
NA
NA
NA
cried Anne, unable to dissimulate before the coadjutor, whom she looked
upon, and probably with reason, as the promoter of the tumult. â€œRevolt!
thus it is called by those who have wished for this demonstration and
who are, perhaps, the cause of it; but, wait, wait! the kingâ€™s authority
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA

The coadjutor bowed.

NA
The coadjutor looked at the queen, who replied by a sign in the
affirmative.
NA
NA
NA
exclaimed the queen.

NA

NA
The color mounted to the queenâ€™s face; her fine blue eyes seemed to
start out of her head and her carmine lips, compared by all the poets of
the day to a pomegranate in flower, were trembling with anger. Mazarin
himself, who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this
disturbed household, was alarmed.
NA
NA
Gondy remained firm, and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his
head as the sarcasms of the evening before had done; but hatred and
revenge were accumulating in his heart silently and drop by drop. He
looked coldly at the queen, who nudged Mazarin to make him say something
in his turn.
Mazarin, according to his custom, was thinking much and saying little.
NA

â€œIf you yield him dead, all will indeed be at an end, my lord, but quite

NA
NA
NA
NA
The coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed, still with
the same tranquillity:
â€œMadame, if the opinion I have submitted to you does not please you it
is doubtless because you have better counsels to follow. I know too well
the wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they

NA
biting her lips with rage, â€œthat yesterdayâ€™s riot, which to-day is
NA
NA
â€œBut if I am to believe you, sir, the people seem to have thrown off all
NA
NA
NA
NA
queen.
NA
NA
Every one shuddered and there was a moment of silence, during which the
queen pressed her hand to her side, evidently to still the beatings of
her heart.
NA
NA
NA
Porthos looked at Dâ€™Artagnan in astonishment. Evidently he did not
understand his meaning.)
NA
such measures as seem good to you, but I foresee that they will be
NA
â€œIn that case, you, monsieur le coadjuteur, who have such power over

NA
NA
shall have lost all influence; while by giving up Broussel your majesty
will strike at the root of the sedition and will gain the right to

NA
NA
NA
heart. Oh! if he were minister and I were his Dâ€™Artagnan, instead of
belonging to that beast of a Mazarin, mordieu! what fine things we would
NA
NA
The queen made a sign for every one, except Mazarin, to quit the room;
and Gondy bowed, as if to leave with the rest.
NA
NA
NA
all events it shall not be by me. I swear to Heaven, on the contrary,
NA
NA
NA
NA
The queenâ€™s eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had
closed the door she turned away. It was evident that she was making
unnatural efforts to subdue her anger; she fanned herself, smelled at
her vinaigrette and walked up and down. Gondy, who began to feel uneasy,
examined the tapestry with his eyes, touched the coat of mail which he
wore under his long gown and felt from time to time to see if the handle
of a good Spanish dagger, which was hidden under his cloak, was well
within reach.
NA
NA
â€œIt is this, madame: that you should appear to have reflected, and
publicly acknowledge an error, which constitutes the extra strength of a
strong government; release Broussel from prison and give him back to the
NA
NA
This screaming mob, are they, or are they not, my subjects? Have I
friends? Have I guards? Ah! by Notre Dame! as Queen Catherine used to
NA
NA
And she sprang toward Gondy, whom assuredly at that moment she hated
more than Broussel, with outstretched arms. The coadjutor remained
immovable and not a muscle of his face was discomposed; only his glance
flashed like a sword in returning the furious looks of the queen.

he could reach the good prelate I would kill Vitry at once; the cardinal

Then he added in Spanish, â€œAnne, are you mad? You, a queen to quarrel
like a washerwoman! And do you not perceive that in the person of this
priest is represented the whole people of Paris and that it is dangerous
to insult him at this moment, and if this priest wished it, in an hour
you would be without a crown? Come, then, on another occasion you can be
firm and strong; but to-day is not the proper time; to-day, flatter and
NA
(At the first words of this address Dâ€™Artagnan had seized Porthosâ€™s arm,
which he pressed with gradually increasing force. When Mazarin ceased
speaking he said to Porthos in a low tone:
â€œNever tell Mazarin that I understand Spanish, or I am a lost man and
NA
NA
This rough appeal, marked by the eloquence which characterized Mazarin
when he spoke in Italian or Spanish and which he lost entirely in
speaking French, was uttered with such impenetrable expression that
Gondy, clever physiognomist as he was, had no suspicion of its being
more than a simple warning to be more subdued.
The queen, on her part, thus chided, softened immediately and sat down,
and in an almost weeping voice, letting her arms fall by her side, said:
â€œPardon me, sir, and attribute this violence to what I suffer. A woman,
and consequently subject to the weaknesses of my sex, I am alarmed at
the idea of civil war; a queen, accustomed to be obeyed, I am excited at
NA
NA
my sincere advice as opposition. Your majesty has none but submissive
and respectful subjects. It is not the queen with whom the people are
displeased; they ask for Broussel and are only too happy, if you release

Mazarin, who at the words, â€œIt is not the queen with whom the people are

NA
Gondyâ€™s suppression of this fact, he said with his sweetest voice and
his most gracious expression:

we have; the first available cardinalâ€™s hat seems to belong already to

NA

NA
NA
Gondy looked at Mazarin, astonished, and Mazarin approached the queen to
speak to her, but at this moment a frightful tumult arose from the
square of the Palais Royal.
Gondy smiled, the queenâ€™s color rose and Mazarin grew even paler.
NA
At this moment Comminges rushed into the room.
NA

The moaning of waves, the noise of thunder, the roaring of a volcano,
cannot be compared with the tempest of cries heard at that moment.

NA
NA
NA
Comminges went out with a soldierâ€™s passive obedience.
At this moment a monstrous battering was heard. One of the gates began
to yield.
NA
NA
At this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal, Anne became
alarmed in her turn and would have recalled Comminges.
NA
The gale had given way. Hoarse shouts were heard from the excited mob.
Dâ€™Artagnan put his hand to his sword, motioning to Porthos to follow his
example.
NA
Gondy sprang to the window and threw it open; he recognized Louvieres at
the head of a troop of about three or four thousand men.
NA
NA
NA
NA
The queen fell into a chair, took the pen and signed.
The people, kept back by Louvieres, had not made another step forward;
but the awful murmuring, which indicates an angry people, continued.
The queen had written, â€œThe keeper of the prison at Saint Germain will

The coadjutor, whose eyes devoured her slightest movements, seized the
paper immediately the signature had been affixed to it, returned to the
window and waved it in his hand.

Then, after a moment of reverie, he remembered where he had left
Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos and that they must have overheard everything. He
knit his brows and went direct to the tapestry, which he pushed aside.
The closet was empty.
At the queenâ€™s last word, Dâ€™Artagnan had dragged Porthos into the
gallery. Thither Mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends
walking up and down.
NA
NA
I thought that this command was intended for us as well as for the
NA
NA
NA
to contradict him.
Mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that Dâ€™Artagnan had seen and
heard everything; but he was pleased with his falsehood.
â€œDecidedly, Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan, you are the man I have been seeking.

musketeers with his most gracious smile, he re-entered his closet more
calmly, for on the departure of De Gondy the uproar had ceased as though
by enchantment.

Anne of Austria returned to her oratory, furious.

mother-in-law, Maria de Medicis; they saw my mother-in-law, their former
regent, expelled by the cardinal; they saw Monsieur de Vendome, that is
to say, the son of Henry IV., a prisoner at Vincennes; and whilst these
great personages were imprisoned, insulted and threatened, they said
nothing; and now for a Broussel--good God! what, then, is to become of
NA
The queen unconsciously touched here upon the exciting question. The
people had made no demonstration for the princes, but they had risen for
Broussel; they were taking the part of a plebeian and in defending
Broussel they instinctively felt they were defending themselves.
During this time Mazarin walked up and down the study, glancing from
time to time at his beautiful Venetian mirror, starred in every

Mazarin, clever politician as he was, was for once mistaken; Broussel
was a thing, not a name.
The next morning, therefore, when Broussel made his entrance into Paris
in a large carriage, having his son Louvieres at his side and Friquet
behind the vehicle, the people threw themselves in his way and cries of
NA
and was death to Mazarinâ€™s ears; and the cardinalâ€™s spies brought bad
news from every direction, which greatly agitated the minister, but was
calmly received by the queen. The latter seemed to be maturing in her
mind some great stroke, a fact which increased the uneasiness of the
cardinal, who knew the proud princess and dreaded much the determination
of Anne of Austria.
The coadjutor returned to parliament more a monarch than king, queen,
and cardinal, all three together. By his advice a decree from parliament
summoned the citizens to lay down their arms and demolish the
barricades. They now knew that it required but one hour to take up arms
again and one night to reconstruct the barricades.
Rochefort had returned to the Chevalier dâ€™Humieres his fifty horsemen,
less two, missing at roll call. But the chevalier was himself at heart a
Frondist and would hear nothing said of compensation.
The mendicant had gone to his old place on the steps of Saint Eustache
and was again distributing holy water with one hand and asking alms with
the other. No one could suspect that those two hands had been engaged
with others in drawing out from the social edifice the keystone of
royalty.
Louvieres was proud and satisfied; he had taken revenge on Mazarin and
had aided in his fatherâ€™s deliverance from prison. His name had been
mentioned as a name of terror at the Palais Royal. Laughingly he said to
the councillor, restored to his family:
â€œDo you think, father, that if now I should ask for a company the queen
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan profited by this interval of calm to send away Raoul, whom he
had great difficulty in keeping shut up during the riot, and who wished
positively to strike a blow for one party or the other. Raoul had
offered some opposition at first; but Dâ€™Artagnan made use of the Comte
de la Fereâ€™s name, and after paying a visit to Madame de Chevreuse,
Raoul started to rejoin the army.
Rochefort alone was dissatisfied with the termination of affairs. He had
written to the Duc de Beaufort to come and the duke was about to arrive,
and he would find Paris tranquil. He went to the coadjutor to consult
with him whether it would not be better to send word to the duke to stop
on the road, but Gondy reflected for a moment, and then said:
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThe knowledge that I have of the queenâ€™s heart; she will not rest
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI know that she has written to the prince to return in haste from the

NA
NA
In fact, the evening after this conversation the report was circulated
that the Prince de Conde had arrived. It was a very simple, natural
circumstance and yet it created a profound sensation. It was said that
Madame de Longueville, for whom the prince had more than a brotherâ€™s
affection and in whom he had confided, had been indiscreet. His
confidence had unveiled the sinister project of the queen.
Even on the night of the princeâ€™s return, some citizens, bolder than the
rest, such as the sheriffs, captains and the quartermaster, went from
house to house among their friends, saying:
â€œWhy do we not take the king and place him in the Hotel de Ville? It is
a shame to leave him to be educated by our enemies, who will give him
evil counsel; whereas, brought up by the coadjutor, for instance, he

That night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray
and black cloaks, the patrols of armed shop-people, and the bands of
mendicants reappeared.
The queen had passed the night in lonely conference with the prince, who
had entered the oratory at midnight and did not leave till five oâ€™clock
in the morning.
At five oâ€™clock Anne went to the cardinalâ€™s room. If she had not yet
taken any repose, he at least was already up. Six days had already
passed out of the ten he had asked from Mordaunt; he was therefore
occupied in revising his reply to Cromwell, when some one knocked gently
at the door of communication with the queenâ€™s apartments. Anne of
Austria alone was permitted to enter by that door. The cardinal
therefore rose to open it.
The queen was in a morning gown, but it became her still; for, like
Diana of Poictiers and Ninon, Anne of Austria enjoyed the privilege of
remaining ever beautiful; nevertheless, this morning she looked
handsomer than usual, for her eyes had all the sparkle inward
satisfaction adds to expression.

perpetuate the crime and punishment by making a frightful example.

Mazarinâ€™s face, smiling as it was, became clouded.

fear; I have not so much as you have, since I do not fly as you do.
Against whom do they cry out? is it against you or against myself? Whom
would they hang, yourself or me? Well, I can weather the storm--I, whom,
notwithstanding, you tax with fear--not with bravado, that is not my
way; but I am firm. Imitate me. Make less hubbub and think more deeply.
NA
Mazarin shrugged his shoulders and taking the queenâ€™s hand led her to
the window.
NA
NA
â€œWell, what do you see from this window? If I am not mistaken those are
citizens, helmeted and mailed, armed with good muskets, as in the time
of the League, and whose eyes are so intently fixed on this window that
they will see you if you raise that curtain much; and now come to the
other side--what do you see? Creatures of the people, armed with
halberds, guarding your doors. You will see the same at every opening
from this palace to which I should lead you. Your doors are guarded, the
airholes of your cellars are guarded, and I could say to you, as that
good La Ramee said to me of the Duc de Beaufort, you must be either bird

And he quietly resumed his dispatch at the place where he had been
interrupted.
Anne, trembling with anger and scarlet with humiliation, left the room,
shutting the door violently after her. Mazarin did not even turn around.
When once more in her own apartment Anne fell into a chair and wept;
then suddenly struck with an idea:

And running to a table, on which were paper, pens and ink, she hastily
began to write.
50. The Interview.
It had been Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s practice, ever since the riots, to sleep in the
same room as Porthos, and on this eventful morning he was still there,
sleeping, and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and
was raining gold pieces into his hat, which he held out till it was
overflowing with pistoles. As for Porthos, he dreamed that the panels of
his carriage were not capacious enough to contain the armorial bearings
he had ordered to be painted on them. They were both aroused at seven
oâ€™clock by the entrance of an unliveried servant, who brought a letter
for Dâ€™Artagnan.
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when the
door was closed he sprang up from his bed and read rapidly, whilst
Porthos looked at him with starting eyes, not daring to ask a single
question.
NA
time, at least, you are sure of your title of baron, and I of my
NA
Porthos took the letter and with a trembling voice read the following
words:
â€œThe queen wishes to speak to Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan, who must follow the

NA
NA
â€œIt is evident, by their sending for me, that matters are becoming
complicated. Just reflect a little what an agitation the queenâ€™s mind
NA
NA
â€œSharpen your sword, baron, load your pistols, and give some corn to the
horses, for I will answer for it, something lightning-like will happen
NA
NA
suggested Porthos, incessantly thinking how his greatness must be
irksome to inferior people.
NA
NA
And Dâ€™Artagnan dressed himself in an instant.
Whilst Porthos, still in bed, was hooking on his cloak for him, a second
knock at the door was heard.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan looked at Porthos.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œQuick, quick, Dâ€™Artagnan. Remember that the queen awaits you, and after
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan summoned Anne of Austriaâ€™s servant and signified that he was
ready to follow him into the queenâ€™s presence.
The servant conducted him by the Rue des Petits Champs and turning to
the left entered the little garden gate leading into the Rue Richelieu;
then they gained the private staircase and Dâ€™Artagnan was ushered into
the oratory. A certain emotion, for which he could not account, made the
lieutenantâ€™s heart beat: he had no longer the assurance of youth;
experience had taught him the importance of past events. Formerly he
would have approached the queen as a young man who bends before a woman;
but now it was a different thing; he answered her summons as an humble
soldier obeys an illustrious general.
The silence of the oratory was at last disturbed by the slight rustling
of silk, and Dâ€™Artagnan started when he perceived the tapestry raised by
a white hand, which, by its form, its color and its beauty he recognized
as that royal hand which had one day been presented to him to kiss. The
queen entered.
NA
melancholy interest on the countenance of the officer, â€œand I know you
well. Look at me well in your turn. I am the queen; do you recognize
NA
NA
NA
expression to her voice which she could do at will, â€œthat in former days
the queen had once need of a young, brave and devoted cavalier--that she
found this cavalier--and that, although he might have thought that she
had forgotten him, she had kept a place for him in the depths of her
NA
NA
NA
least for the queen, for to-day she has need of the same courage and the
NA
NA
such devoted servants, such wise counselors, men, in short, so great by
merit or position--does she deign to cast her eyes on an obscure
NA
Anne understood this covert reproach and was more moved than irritated
by it. She had many a time felt humiliated by the self-sacrifice and
disinterestedness shown by the Gascon gentleman. She had allowed herself
to be exceeded in generosity.
â€œAll that you tell me of those by whom I am surrounded, Monsieur
NA
in you alone. I know that you belong to the cardinal, but belong to me
as well, and I will take upon myself the making of your fortune. Come,
will you do to-day what formerly the gentleman you do not know did for
NA
NA
The queen reflected for a moment and then, seeing the cautious demeanor
of the musketeer:
NA
NA
NA
â€œI had three, two of whom have left Paris, to go I know not where. One
alone is left to me, but he is one of those known, I believe, to the
NA
NA
NA
â€œReturn at five oâ€™clock and I will tell you; but do not breathe to a
NA
NA
NA
â€œMadame, I have never been false to my word; when I say I will not do a
NA
The queen, although astonished at this language, to which she was not
accustomed from her courtiers, argued from it a happy omen of the zeal
with which Dâ€™Artagnan would serve her in the accomplishment of her
project. It was one of the Gasconâ€™s artifices to hide his deep cunning
occasionally under an appearance of rough loyalty.
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan bowed and went out.
NA
NA
Then, as the half hour had already glided by, he crossed the gallery and
knocked at the cardinalâ€™s door.
Bernouin introduced him.
NA
And according to his custom Dâ€™Artagnan glanced rapidly around and
remarked that Mazarin had a sealed letter before him. But it was so
placed on the desk that he could not see to whom it was addressed.
NA
NA
NA
NA
replied the Gascon, impudently, firm to the promise he had just made to
Anne of Austria.
â€œI opened the door of the ante-room myself and I saw you enter at the
NA
NA
NA
NA
Mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make Dâ€™Artagnan reveal
anything he was desirous of hiding, so he gave up, for the time, the
discovery of the mystery the Gascon was concealing.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
In fact, the side of the letter opposite the seal was blank.
NA
â€œI understand; and I am to take off the first one when I have reached a

â€œJust so, take it and go. You have a friend, Monsieur du Vallon, whom I

NA
NA
NA
â€œNo, my lord, and I will set out at once. There is one thing only which

NA
NA
NA
â€œMerely to say these words: â€˜I am going to send Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan away

NA
â€œI had the honor of saying to your eminence that there had been some

him, to see if he had left any of his keys in his closets, Mazarin went
out. Ten minutes elapsed, during which Dâ€™Artagnan made every effort to
read through the first envelope what was written on the second. But he
did not succeed.
Mazarin returned, pale, and evidently thoughtful. He seated himself at
his desk and Dâ€™Artagnan proceeded to examine his face, as he had just
examined the letter he held, but the envelope which covered his
countenance appeared as impenetrable as that which covered the letter.
NA
meditates. Is it about sending me to the Bastile? All very fine, my
lord, but at the very first hint you give of such a thing I will
strangle you and become Frondist. I should be carried home in triumph
like Monsieur Broussel and Athos would proclaim me the French Brutus. It

The Gascon, with his vivid imagination, had already seen the advantage
to be derived from his situation. Mazarin gave, however, no order of the
kind, but on the contrary began to be insinuating.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan obeyed, and Mazarin ascertained that the seal was intact.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œReturn, then, at five oâ€™clock and bring that worthy Monsieur du Vallon
with you. Only, leave him in the ante-room, as I wish to speak to you
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan bowed, and thought: â€œBoth at the same hour; both commands
alike; both at the Palais Royal. Monsieur de Gondy would pay a hundred
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan saluted, went out and hastened to repeat to his friend
Mazarinâ€™s flattering promises, which gave Porthos an indescribable
happiness.
51. The Flight.
When Dâ€™Artagnan returned to the Palais Royal at five oâ€™clock, it
presented, in spite of the excitement which reigned in the town, a
spectacle of the greatest rejoicing. Nor was that surprising. The queen
had restored Broussel and Blancmesnil to the people and had therefore
nothing to fear, since the people had nothing more just then to ask for.
The return, also, of the conqueror of Lens was the pretext for giving a
grand banquet. The princes and princesses were invited and their
carriages had crowded the court since noon; then after dinner the queen
was to have a play in her apartment. Anne of Austria had never appeared
more brilliant than on that day--radiant with grace and wit. Mazarin
disappeared as they rose from table. He found Dâ€™Artagnan waiting for him
already at his post in the ante-room.
The cardinal advanced to him with a smile and taking him by the hand led
him into his study.

â€œThe queen has resolved to make a little excursion with the king to

NA
NA
â€œIt is a way I have of speaking to myself. I neither approve nor

â€œGood; it is you, accordingly, that I have pitched upon to conduct the

composure, â€œthat, as I have told you, the welfare of the state is placed

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAnd you will place the king and queen in safety also, at Saint

Dâ€™Artagnan smiled.

pearl-gray and red, entirely embroidered with silver.
NA
NA
â€œBut it will be necessary for your eminence to do what the other day you

killed six thousand Angevins in Sicily because they pronounced Italian
badly. Take care that the French do not take their revenge on you for

NA

Mazarin reflected.
â€œThis affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor, my lord; the

Mazarin shuddered, but he reflected that a man who had the least
intention to betray would not warn first.

NA
NA

NA

NA
NA
the queenâ€™s diamond, which Mazarin wore on his finger. Mazarin followed
the direction of his eyes and gently turned the hoop of the ring inside.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan smiled--he was just the man to understand the astute Italian.
Mazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment.
â€œYou will begin, therefore, by taking me first out of Paris, will you

NA
serious manner.
NA
NA
NA
â€œmy life is theirs and I must give it for them. If they ask it what have
NA
NA
NA
to turn the hoop of his ring outside again. Dâ€™Artagnan smiled. These two
men met at one point and that was, cunning; had they been actuated
equally by courage, the one would have done great things for the other.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan, there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly, it is but
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan spared Mazarin the trouble of insisting, and after looking to
see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its
water, he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable
pleasure.
NA
NA
NA
us speak of your little affairs. You wish to leave before everybody and
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThen it is possible. I can get you out of Paris and leave you beyond
NA
NA
NA
â€œI give you absolute power, therefore; take as large an escort as you
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan shook his head.
NA
â€œYes, for you, my lord, but not for the queen; you must leave it to me
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, then, it is a settled thing; and now, my lord, will you obtain
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Mazarin hesitated for one instant, but Dâ€™Artagnan was firm.
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan.
NA
â€œI never swear, my lord, I say yes or no; and, as I am a gentleman, I

NA
NA
NA
desiring him to wait there. He did not wait long, for in five minutes
the queen entered in full gala costume. Thus dressed she scarcely
appeared thirty-five years of age. She was still exceedingly handsome.
NA
NA
â€œI ought to ask your majestyâ€™s pardon, but I wished to receive your
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
disinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a
moment, but I swear to you that I shall not forget this second service
NA
â€œYour majesty is free to forget or to remember, as it pleases you; and I

NA

And Dâ€™Artagnan retired, but as he passed out he glanced at the curtain
through which the queen had entered and at the bottom of the tapestry he
remarked the tip of a velvet slipper.
NA
betrayed him. In truth, that Italian puppet does not deserve the
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan was not less exact to his appointment and at half-past nine
oâ€™clock he entered the ante-room.
He found the cardinal dressed as an officer, and he looked very well in
that costume, which, as we have already said, he wore elegantly; only he
was very pale and trembled slightly.
NA
NA
NA
â€œCertainly, my lord; he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI should have thought, on the contrary, that it ought to have inspired

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
And so they descended the private stair, Mazarin leaning on the arm of
Dâ€™Artagnan a hand the musketeer felt trembling. At last, after crossing
the courts of the Palais Royal, where there still remained some of the
conveyances of late guests, they entered the garden and reached the
little gate. Mazarin attempted to open it by a key which he took from
his pocket, but with such shaking fingers that he could not find the
keyhole.
NA
the key in his pocket, reckoning upon returning by that gate.
The steps were already down and the door open. Mousqueton stood at the
door and Porthos was inside the carriage.
NA
carriage without waiting for a second bidding. Dâ€™Artagnan followed him,
and Mousqueton, having closed the door, mounted behind the carriage with
many groans. He had made some difficulties about going, under pretext
that he still suffered from his wound, but Dâ€™Artagnan had said to him:
â€œRemain if you like, my dear Monsieur Mouston, but I warn you that Paris
NA
without asking anything further, that he was ready to follow his master
and Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan to the end of the world.
The carriage started at a measured pace, without betraying by the
slightest sign that it contained people in a hurry. The cardinal wiped
his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around him. On his left
was Porthos, whilst Dâ€™Artagnan was on his right; each guarded a door and
served as a rampart to him on either side. Before him, on the front
seat, lay two pairs of pistols--one in front of Porthos and the other of
Dâ€™Artagnan. About a hundred paces from the Palais Royal a patrol stopped
the carriage.
NA
NA
hair stood on end. But the joke appeared an excellent one to the
citizens, who, seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed, would
never have believed in the possibility of so great an imprudence.
NA
NA
NA
NA
About the middle of the Rue des Petits Champs they were stopped by a
second patrol.
NA
NA
behind the two friends that he disappeared, completely hidden between
them.
NA
perceived that they had rushed to the horsesâ€™ heads. But putting his
head out of the carriage:
NA
The chief approached, and it was indeed Planchet; Dâ€™Artagnan had
recognized the voice of his old servant.
NA
â€œEh! mon Dieu! yes, my good friend, this worthy Porthos has just
received a sword wound and I am taking him to his country house at Saint
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
ill; should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to
NA
NA
NA
NA
Porthos uttered a deep groan.
NA
NA
Planchet shook his head with the air of a man who says, â€œIn that case
NA
NA
The carriage resumed its course, and Mazarin, who had held his breath,
ventured to breathe again.
NA
A few steps in advance of the gate of Saint Honore they met a third
troop; this latter party was composed of ill-looking fellows, who
resembled bandits more than anything else; they were the men of the
beggar of Saint Eustache.
NA
Porthos placed his hand on the pistols.
NA
NA
A man advanced to the door with a kind of scythe in his hand. â€œQui
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The coachman raised his whip.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, by a blow of your fist, if you can; we will not fire but at the
NA
NA
NA
taking one of the pistols up by the muzzle and preparing to strike with
the handle. And as the man approached, Dâ€™Artagnan, in order to have more
freedom for his actions, leaned half out of the door; his eyes were
fixed upon those of the mendicant, which were lighted up by a lantern.
Without doubt he recognized Dâ€™Artagnan, for he became deadly pale;
doubtless the musketeer knew him, for his hair stood up on his head.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan was perhaps about to reply, when a blow, similar to that of a
mallet falling on the head of an ox, was heard. The noise was caused by
Porthos, who had just knocked down his man.
Dâ€™Artagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about
four paces off.
NA
The coachman bestowed a heavy blow of the whip upon his horses; the
noble animals bounded forward; then cries of men who were knocked down
were heard; then a double concussion was felt, and two of the wheels
seemed to pass over a round and flexible body. There was a momentâ€™s
silence, then the carriage cleared the gate.
NA
Mazarin he said, â€œNow, my lord, you can say five paters and five aves,
NA
Mazarin replied only by a groan; he could not believe in such a miracle.
Five minutes later the carriage stopped, having reached Cours la Reine.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
took and shook in his.
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan looked with surprise at his friend.
NA
â€œI think I have sprained my wrist,â€™ said Porthos.
NA
â€œIt was necessary; my man was going to fire a pistol at me; but you--how
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Without further explanation Dâ€™Artagnan took the pistols which were upon
the front seat, placed them in his belt, wrapped himself in his cloak,
and not wishing to enter by the same gate as that through which they had
left, he took his way toward the Richelieu gate.
52. The Carriage of Monsieur le Coadjuteur.
Instead of returning, then, by the Saint Honore gate, Dâ€™Artagnan, who
had time before him, walked around and re-entered by the Porte
Richelieu. He was approached to be examined, and when it was discovered
by his plumed hat and his laced coat, that he was an officer of the
musketeers, he was surrounded, with the intention of making him cry,
NA
at first; but when he discovered what it meant, he shouted it in such a
voice that even the most exacting were satisfied. He walked down the Rue
Richelieu, meditating how he should carry off the queen in her turn, for
to take her in a carriage bearing the arms of France was not to be
thought of, when he perceived an equipage standing at the door of the
hotel belonging to Madame de Guemenee.
He was struck by a sudden idea.
NA
And approaching the carriage, he examined the arms on the panels and the
livery of the coachman on his box. This scrutiny was so much the more
easy, the coachman being sound asleep.
NA
NA
He mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which
was attached to the coachmanâ€™s little finger.
NA
The coachman awoke with a start and drove off in the direction he was
desired, never doubting but that the order had come from his master. The
porter at the palace was about to close the gates, but seeing such a
handsome equipage he fancied that it was some visit of importance and
the carriage was allowed to pass and to stop beneath the porch. It was
then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehicle;
he fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back, and without
dropping the reins he sprang from his box to open the door. Dâ€™Artagnan,
in his turn, sprang to the ground, and just at the moment when the
coachman, alarmed at not seeing his master, fell back a step, he seized
him by his collar with the left, whilst with the right hand he placed
the muzzle of a pistol at his breast.
NA
NA
The coachman perceived at once, by the expression of the man who thus
addressed him, that he had fallen into a trap, and he remained with his
mouth wide open and his eyes portentously staring.
Two musketeers were pacing the court, to whom Dâ€™Artagnan called by their
names.
NA

drive to the door of the private stair, and wait for me there; it is an

The musketeer, who knew that his lieutenant was incapable of jesting
with regard to the service, obeyed without a word, although he thought
the order strange. Then turning toward the second musketeer, Dâ€™Artagnan
said:
NA
The musketeer, thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some
prince in disguise, bowed, and drawing his sword, signified that he was
ready. Dâ€™Artagnan mounted the staircase, followed by his prisoner, who
in his turn was followed by the soldier, and entered Mazarinâ€™s
ante-room. Bernouin was waiting there, impatient for news of his master.
NA
â€œEverything goes on capitally, my dear Monsieur Bernouin, but here is a
NA
NA
â€œWhere you like, provided that the place which you shall choose has iron
NA
NA
conducted to a closet, the windows of which were barred and which looked
very much like a prison.
NA
NA
The coachman, as we can well understand, made no resistance; in fact, he
was so astonished at what had happened to him that he stammered and
reeled like a drunken man; Dâ€™Artagnan deposited his clothes under the
arm of one of the valets.
NA
until Monsieur Bernouin returns to open the door. The duty will be

NA
NA

NA
NA
The musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to
the letter, and Dâ€™Artagnan went out, followed by Bernouin. Midnight
struck.
NA
am here, and put this parcel, with a well-loaded musket, under the seat
NA
Bernouin conducted Dâ€™Artagnan to the oratory, where he sat down
pensively. Everything had gone on as usual at the Palais Royal. As we
said before, by ten oâ€™clock almost all the guests had dispersed; those
who were to fly with the court had the word of command and they were
each severally desired to be from twelve oâ€™clock to one at Cours la
Reine.
At ten oâ€™clock Anne of Austria had entered the kingâ€™s room. Monsieur had
just retired, and the youthful Louis, remaining the last, was amusing
himself by placing some lead soldiers in a line of battle, a game which
delighted him much. Two royal pages were playing with him.
NA
The king asked to remain up, having, he said, no wish to sleep; but the
queen was firm.
â€œAre you not going to-morrow morning at six oâ€™clock, Louis, to bathe at
NA
NA
room when you have kissed me. Laporte, give the light to Monsieur the
NA
The queen touched with her lips the white, smooth brow the royal child
presented to her with a gravity which already partook of etiquette.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The king went out, accompanied by the Chevalier de Coislin, bearing the
candlestick, and then the queen returned to her own apartment. Her
ladies--that is to say Madame de Bregy, Mademoiselle de Beaumont, Madame
de Motteville, and Socratine, her sister, so called on account of her
sense--had just brought into her dressing-room the remains of the
dinner, on which, according to her usual custom, she supped. The queen
then gave her orders, spoke of a banquet which the Marquis de Villequier
was to give to her on the day after the morrow, indicated the persons
she would admit to the honor of partaking of it, announced another visit
on the following day to Val-de-Grace, where she intended to pay her
devotions, and gave her commands to her senior valet to accompany her.
When the ladies had finished their supper the queen feigned extreme
fatigue and passed into her bedroom. Madame de Motteville, who was on
especial duty that evening, followed to aid and undress her. The queen
then began to read, and after conversing with her affectionately for a
few minutes, dismissed her.
It was at this moment Dâ€™Artagnan entered the courtyard of the palace, in
the coadjutorâ€™s carriage, and a few seconds later the carriages of the
ladies-in-waiting drove out and the gates were shut after them.
A few minutes after twelve oâ€™clock Bernouin knocked at the queenâ€™s
bedroom door, having come by the cardinalâ€™s secret corridor. Anne of
Austria opened the door to him herself. She was dressed, that is to say,
in dishabille, wrapped in a long, warm dressing-gown.
NA
â€œYes, madame, in your oratory. He is waiting till your majesty is
NA
â€œI am. Go and tell Laporte to wake and dress the king, and then pass on
NA
Bernouin bowed and retired.
The queen entered her oratory, which was lighted by a single lamp of
Venetian crystal, She saw Dâ€™Artagnan, who stood expecting her.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œHas got off without any accident. He is awaiting your majesty at Cours
NA
NA
â€œI have provided for everything; a carriage below is waiting for your

NA
Dâ€™Artagnan bowed and followed the queen. The young Louis was already
dressed, with the exception of his shoes and doublet; he had allowed
himself to be dressed, in great astonishment, overwhelming Laporte with
questions, who replied only in these words, â€œSire, it is by the queenâ€™s
NA
The bedclothes were thrown back, exposing the kingâ€™s bed linen, which
was so worn that here and there holes could be seen. It was one of the
results of Mazarinâ€™s niggardliness.
The queen entered and Dâ€™Artagnan remained at the door. As soon as the
child perceived the queen he escaped from Laporte and ran to meet her.
Anne then motioned to Dâ€™Artagnan to approach, and he obeyed.
NA
standing uncovered, â€œhere is Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan, who is as brave as one
of those ancient heroes of whom you like so much to hear from my women.

The young king looked at the officer with his large-formed eye, and
repeated:

The young king slowly raised his little hand and held it out to the
musketeer; the latter bent on his knee and kissed it.

At this moment they were startled by a noise as if a tumult were
approaching.

Nothing is so catching as confidence. The queen, full of energy and
courage, was quickly alive to these two virtues in others.
NA
â€œWill your majesty permit me to give orders in your name throughout this

NA
NA
NA
left the room.
The tumult continued to increase and seemed to surround the Palais Royal
entirely. Cries were heard from the interior, of which they could not
comprehend the sense. It was evident that there was clamor and sedition.
The king, half dressed, the queen and Laporte remained each in the same
state and almost in the same place, where they were listening and
waiting. Comminges, who was on guard that night at the Palais Royal, ran
in. He had about two hundred men in the courtyards and stables, and he
placed them at the queenâ€™s disposal.
NA
NA
â€œIt means, madame, that the report has spread that the queen has left
the Palais Royal, carrying off the king, and the people ask to have

NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan saw from the expression of the queenâ€™s face that she was
about to issue some violent command. He approached her and said in a low
voice:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œLet your majesty dismiss M. de Comminges and desire him to shut himself
NA
Comminges glanced at Dâ€™Artagnan with the envious look with which every
courtier sees a new favorite spring up.
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan went up to him; with his usual quickness he caught the
anxious glance.
NA
the queen, are we not? It is my turn to be of use to her; do not envy me
NA
Comminges bowed and left.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The queen became thoughtful and smiled, like a woman to whom duplicity
is no stranger.
NA
NA
through the grating that they are going to be satisfied and that in five
minutes they shall not only see the king, but they shall see him in bed;
add that the king sleeps and that the queen begs that they will keep
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œIt shall take but a quarter of an hour, I answer for everything,
madame; believe me, I know the people; they are like a great child, who
only wants humoring. Before the sleeping king they will be mute, gentle
NA
NA
The young king approached his mother and said, â€œWhy do as these people
NA
NA
NA
The queen remained silent.
NA
NA
Louis XIV. turned around, astonished that any one should dare to address
him. But the queen pressed the childâ€™s hand.
NA
â€œDoes your majesty remember, when playing in the park of Fontainebleau,
or in the palace courts at Versailles, ever to have seen the sky grow
NA
NA
â€œWell, then, this noise of thunder, however much your majesty may have
NA
â€œCertainly, sir; but they tell me that the noise of thunder is the voice
NA
NA
NA
In truth at that moment a terrible murmur was wafted to them by the
night breeze; then all at once it ceased.
NA
NA
The queen looked with surprise at this strange man, whose brilliant
courage made him the equal of the bravest, and who was, by his fine and
quick intelligence, the equal of the most astute.
Laporte entered.
NA
NA
accomplished; they are calm, as if by enchantment. The doors are about
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Laporte placed the king, dressed as he was, in the bed and then covered
him as far as the shoulders with the sheet. The queen bent over him and
kissed his brow.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œMonsieur Laporte, go to them and again recommend silence. Madame, wait
at the door, whilst I shall be at the head of the kingâ€™s bed, ready to

Laporte went out; the queen remained standing near the hangings, whilst
Dâ€™Artagnan glided behind the curtains.
Then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard, and
the queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her
lips.
On seeing the queen, the men stopped short, respectfully.
NA
There was then amongst that crowd a momentâ€™s hesitation, which looked
like shame. They had expected resistance, they had expected to be
thwarted, to have to force the gates, to overturn the guards. The gates
had opened of themselves, and the king, ostensibly at least, had no
other guard at his bed-head but his mother. The foremost of them
stammered and attempted to fall back.
NA
NA
Then one more bold than the rest ventured to pass the door and to
advance on tiptoe. This example was imitated by the rest, until the room
filled silently, as if these men had been the humblest, most devoted
courtiers. Far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to
enter could be seen, all craning to their utmost height to try and see.
Dâ€™Artagnan saw it all through an opening he had made in the curtain, and
in the very first man who entered he recognized Planchet.
NA
â€œyou wished to see the king and therefore I determined to show him to
you myself. Approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance

NA
honor conferred upon him.
NA
with a smile, the expression of which did not deceive Dâ€™Artagnan, â€œthat

â€œI shall tell them, madame, and those who accompany me will say the same

NA
A man wrapped in a cloak, in the folds of which his face was hidden,
approached and leaned over the bed and looked.
For one second, Dâ€™Artagnan thought the man had some evil design and he
put his hand to his sword; but in the movement made by the man in
stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and Dâ€™Artagnan recognized
the coadjutor.
NA
NA
NA
all these men, who had entered enraged, passed from anger to pity and
blessed the royal infant in their turn.
NA
They all bowed, and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had
entered. Planchet, who had been the first to enter, was the last to
leave. The queen stopped him.
NA
Planchet, much surprised at the inquiry, turned back.
NA
received you this evening as if you had been a prince, and I wish to

NA
Dâ€™Artagnan trembled lest Planchet, seduced, like the crow in the fable,
should tell his name, and that the queen, knowing his name, would
discover that Planchet had belonged to him.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œdecidedly Monsieur Planchet is no fool; it is evident he has been
NA
The different actors in this strange scene remained facing one another,
without uttering a single word; the queen standing near the door,
Dâ€™Artagnan half out of his hiding place, the king raised on his elbow,
ready to fall down on his bed again at the slightest sound that would
indicate the return of the multitude, but instead of approaching, the
noise became more and more distant and very soon it died entirely away.
The queen breathed more freely. Dâ€™Artagnan wiped his damp forehead and
NA
At this moment Laporte reappeared.
NA
NA
They announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and
that the queen had spoken to them; and, in fact, they went away quite
NA
NA
NA
Then turning to Dâ€™Artagnan, she said:
â€œSir, you have given me this evening the best advice I have ever
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhenever your majesty pleases. You have only to descend by the private
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan went down and found the carriage at its post and the
musketeer on the box. Dâ€™Artagnan took out the parcel which he had
desired Bernouin to place under the seat. It may be remembered that it
was the hat and cloak belonging to Monsieur de Gondyâ€™s coachman.
He placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head, whilst the
musketeer got off the box.

Tiquetonne, Hotel de la Chevrette, whence you will take my horse and
that of Monsieur du Vallon, which you must saddle and equip as if for
war, and then you will leave Paris, bringing them with you to Cours la
Reine. If, when you arrive at Cours la Reine, you find no one, you must

The musketeer touched his cap and went away to execute the orders thus
received.
Dâ€™Artagnan mounted the box, having a pair of pistols in his belt, a
musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him.
The queen appeared, and was followed by the king and the Duke dâ€™Anjou,
his brother.
NA
NA
NA
The queen uttered a cry of surprise and entered the carriage, and the
king and monsieur took their places at her side.
NA
NA
â€œIt is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening, but of the kingâ€™s

Laporte obeyed.
NA
NA
NA
NA
The blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the Rue
Richelieu. On reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the
head of a dozen men, holding a lantern in his hand.
Dâ€™Artagnan signed to them to draw near.
NA
NA
NA
The sergeant put the lantern near the panel.
NA
NA
The sergeant began to laugh.

The gate groaned on its hinges, and Dâ€™Artagnan, seeing the way clear,
whipped his horses, who started at a canter, and five minutes later they
had rejoined the cardinal.

53. How Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos earned by selling Straw.
Mazarin was desirous of setting out instantly for Saint Germain, but the
queen declared that she should wait for the people whom she had
appointed to meet her. However, she offered the cardinal Laporteâ€™s
place, which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other.
It was not without foundation that a report of the kingâ€™s intention to
leave Paris by night had been circulated. Ten or twelve persons had been
in the secret since six oâ€™clock, and howsoever great their prudence
might be, they could not issue the necessary orders for the departure
without suspicion being generated. Besides, each individual had one or
two others for whom he was interested; and as there could be no doubt
but that the queen was leaving Paris full of terrible projects of
vengeance, every one had warned parents and friends of what was about to
transpire; so that the news of the approaching exit ran like a train of
lighted gunpowder along the streets.
The first carriage which arrived after that of the queen was that of the
Prince de Conde, with the princess and dowager princess. Both these
ladies had been awakened in the middle of the night and did not know
what it all was about. The second contained the Duke and Duchess of
Orleans, the tall young Mademoiselle and the Abbe de la Riviere; and the
third, the Duke de Longueville and the Prince de Conti, brother and
brother-in-law of Conde. They all alighted and hastened to pay their
respects to the king and queen in their coach. The queen fixed her eyes
upon the carriage they had left, and seeing that it was empty, she said:
NA
NA
NA
NA
Anne gave a quick glance to Mazarin, who answered by an almost
imperceptible shake of his head.
NA
NA
NA
brother.
NA
NA
NA
Carriages now arrived in crowds; those of the Marechal de Villeroy,
Guitant, Villequier and Comminges came into the line. The two musketeers
arrived in their turn, holding the horses of Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos in
their hands. These two instantly mounted, the coachman of the latter
replacing Dâ€™Artagnan on the coach-box of the royal coach. Mousqueton
took the place of the coachman, and drove standing, for reasons known to
himself, like Automedon of antiquity.
The queen, though occupied by a thousand details, tried to catch the
Gasconâ€™s eye; but he, with his wonted prudence, had mingled with the
crowd.

Dâ€™Artagnan started off for Saint Germain, followed by Porthos.
NA
And the royal carriage drove on, followed by the other coaches and about
fifty horsemen.
They reached Saint German without any accident; on descending, the queen
found the prince awaiting her, bare-headed, to offer her his hand.
NA
NA
â€œWell, then, let it be war! Have we not on our side the conqueror of

The prince bowed low.
It was then three oâ€™clock in the morning. The queen walked first, every
one followed her. About two hundred persons had accompanied her in her
flight.

but, as we never thought of coming here, I am informed that there are,
in all, only three beds in the whole establishment, one for the king,

NA
NA
a forced smile.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Gaston desired that he should be shown into the room wherein he was to
sleep, without in the least concerning himself as to where his wife and
daughter were to repose.
NA
NA
Porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever
had in the wisdom of his friend. They walked from one end of the chateau
to the other, Porthos looking with wondering eyes at Dâ€™Artagnan, who was
counting on his fingers.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, there are two hundred of them, and each of them will need two,
NA
NA
NA
But as there were all kinds of people about, who were in a state of
stupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court, he whispered in his
friendâ€™s ear.
NA

â€œLet them say what they will; besides, how will they know that we are
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan smiled. The two friends turned down the first street they
came to. Porthos knocked at the door of a house to the right, whilst
Dâ€™Artagnan knocked at the door of a house to the left.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes; thereâ€™s the landlord of the Lamb, and Gros-Louis the farmer; they
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan went instantly to the hay dealer and bargained with him for a
hundred and fifty trusses of straw, which he obtained, at the rate of
three pistoles each. He went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from
him two hundred trusses at the same price. Finally, Farmer Louis sold
them eighty trusses, making in all four hundred and thirty.
There was no more to be had in Saint Germain. This foraging did not
occupy more than half an hour. Mousqueton, duly instructed, was put at
the head of this sudden and new business. He was cautioned not to let a
bit of straw out of his hands under a louis the truss, and they
intrusted to him straw to the amount of four hundred and thirty louis.
Dâ€™Artagnan, taking with him three trusses of straw, returned to the
chateau, where everybody, freezing with cold and more than half asleep,
envied the king, the queen, and the Duke of Orleans, on their camp beds.
The lieutenantâ€™s entrance produced a burst of laughter in the great
drawing-room; but he did not appear to notice that he was the object of
general attention, but began to arrange, with so much cleverness, nicety
and gayety, his straw bed, that the mouths of all these poor creatures,
who could not go to sleep, began to water.
NA
NA
And he conducted them to Mousqueton, who freely distributed the trusses
at the rate of a louis apiece. It was thought rather dear, but people
wanted to sleep, and who would not give even two or three louis for a
few hours of sound sleep?
Dâ€™Artagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it, making it over
about a dozen times; and since he was supposed to have paid, like the
others, a louis for his truss of straw, he pocketed in that way thirty
louis in less than half an hour. At five oâ€™clock in the morning the
straw was worth eighty francs a truss and there was no more to be had.
Dâ€™Artagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his
own use. He put in his pocket the key of the room where he had hidden
them, and accompanied by Porthos returned to settle with Mousqueton,
who, naively, and like the worthy steward that he was, handed them four
hundred and thirty louis and kept one hundred for himself.
Mousqueton, who knew nothing of what was going on in the chateau,
wondered that the idea had not occurred to him sooner. Dâ€™Artagnan put
the gold in his hat, and in going back to the chateau settled the
reckoning with Porthos, each of them had cleared two hundred and fifteen
louis.
Porthos, however, found that he had no straw left for himself. He
returned to Mousqueton, but the steward had sold the last wisp. He then
repaired to Dâ€™Artagnan, who, thanks to his four trusses of straw, was in
the act of making up and tasting, by anticipation, the luxury of a bed
so soft, so well stuffed at the head, so well covered at the foot, that
it would have excited the envy of the king himself, if his majesty had
not been fast asleep in his own. Dâ€™Artagnan could on no account consent
to pull his bed to pieces again for Porthos, but for a consideration of
four louis that the latter paid him for it, he consented that Porthos
should share his couch with him. He laid his sword at the head, his
pistols by his side, stretched his cloak over his feet, placed his felt
hat on the top of his cloak and extended himself luxuriously on the
straw, which rustled under him. He was already enjoying the sweet dream
engendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis, made in
a quarter of an hour, when a voice was heard at the door of the hall,
which made him stir.
NA
NA
Porthos foresaw that if Dâ€™Artagnan was called away he should remain the
sole possessor of the bed. An officer approached.
NA
NA
NA
â€œTell my lord that Iâ€™m going to sleep, and I advise him, as a friend, to
NA
â€œHis eminence is not gone to bed and will not go to bed, and wants you

â€œThe devil take Mazarin, who does not know when to sleep at the proper
time. What does he want with me? Is it to make me a captain? In that

And the musketeer rose, grumbling, took his sword, hat, pistols, and
cloak, and followed the officer, whilst Porthos, alone and sole
possessor of the bed, endeavored to follow the good example of falling
asleep, which his predecessor had set him.
NA

NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan looked at the cardinal with a stupefied air.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Mazarin sighed.
â€œâ€˜Tis very dear living in England, my lord, especially as envoy
NA
NA
NA
He opened a drawer and took out a purse.
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan pouted out his lower lip in a most extraordinary manner.
NA
â€œI suppose not. Monsieur du Vallon, that worthy gentleman, for, with the
exception of yourself, Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan, thereâ€™s not a man in France
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œmay we, that is, my friend and I, depend on having, he his barony, and

â€œYou are to obey the commands of the personage to whom I have addressed

Dâ€™Artagnan then, returning to the officer, said:
â€œSir, have the kindness also to awaken Monsieur du Vallon and to say
â€˜tis by his eminenceâ€™s order, and that I shall await him at the

The officer went off with an eagerness that showed the Gascon that he
had some personal interest in the matter.
Porthos was snoring most musically when some one touched him on the
shoulder.
NA
NA
NA
â€œThat his eminence has ordered you to England and that Monsieur
NA
Porthos sighed heavily, arose, took his hat, his pistols, and his cloak,
and departed, casting a look of regret upon the couch where he had hoped
to sleep so well.
No sooner had he turned his back than the officer laid himself down in
it, and he had scarcely crossed the threshold before his successor, in
his turn, was snoring immoderately. It was very natural, he being the
only person in the whole assemblage, except the king, the queen, and the
Duke of Orleans, who slept gratuitously.
54. In which we hear Tidings of Aramis.
Dâ€™Artagnan went straight to the stables; day was just dawning. He found
his horse and that of Porthos fastened to the manger, but to an empty
manger. He took pity on these poor animals and went to a corner of the
stable, where he saw a little straw, but in doing so he struck his foot
against a human body, which uttered a cry and arose on its knees,
rubbing its eyes. It was Mousqueton, who, having no straw to lie upon,
had helped himself to that of the horses.
NA
Mousqueton, recognizing the voice of his masterâ€™s friend, got up
suddenly, and in doing so let fall some louis which he had appropriated
to himself illegally during the night.
NA
NA
Mousqueton blushed so confusedly that the Gascon began to laugh at him
and said:
â€œPorthos would be angry, my dear Monsieur Mousqueton, but I pardon you,
only let us remember that this gold must serve us as a joke, so be
NA
Mousqueton instantly assumed a jovial countenance, saddled the horses
quickly and mounted his own without making faces over it.
Whilst this went on, Porthos arrived with a very cross look on his face,
and was astonished to find the lieutenant resigned and Mousqueton almost
merry.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
And they both set out for Paris.
On arriving at its gates they were astounded to see the threatening
aspect of the capital. Around a broken-down carriage the people were
uttering imprecations, whilst the persons who had attempted to escape
were made prisoners--that is to say, an old man and two women. On the
other hand, as the two friends approached to enter, they showed them
every kind of civility, thinking them deserters from the royal party and
wishing to bind them to their own.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œHe is awake, so keep on the watch, as they are gone away; itâ€™s for some
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan, â€œdonâ€™t be furious with old men and women, and keep your
NA
The people listened to these words and let go the ladies, who thanked
Dâ€™Artagnan with an eloquent look.
NA
And they continued their way, crossing the barricades, getting the
chains about their legs, pushed about, questioning and questioned.
In the place of the Palais Royal Dâ€™Artagnan saw a sergeant, who was
drilling six or seven hundred citizens. It was Planchet, who brought
into play profitably the recollections of the regiment of Piedmont.
In passing before Dâ€™Artagnan he recognized his former master.
NA
NA
Planchet stopped short, staring at Dâ€™Artagnan. The first row, seeing
their sergeant stop, stopped in their turn, and so on to the very last.
NA
Porthos and went on his way.
Five minutes afterward he entered the hotel of La Chevrette, where
pretty Madeleine, the hostess, came to him.

â€œAh, me! ah, me!

to the hostess that her lamentations were superfluous and that therefore
she had better spare him demonstrations of her grief.
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan opened the letter and read as follows:
â€œDear Dâ€™Artagnan, dear Du Vallon, my good friends, perhaps this may be
the last time that you will ever hear from me. Aramis and I are very
unhappy; but God, our courage, and the remembrance of our friendship
sustain us. Think often of Raoul. I intrust to you certain papers which
are at Blois; and in two months and a half, if you do not hear of us,
take possession of them.

Dâ€™Artagnan continued:
â€œAthos bequeaths to you Raoul, and I bequeath to you my revenge. If by
any good luck you lay your hand on a certain man named Mordaunt, tell
Porthos to take him into a corner and to wring his neck. I dare not say
more in a letter.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œIt is precisely this Monsieur Mordaunt whom we are going to join at
NA
â€œWell, suppose instead of joining this Monsieur Mordaunt we were to go

have frightened an army.
NA
NA
beside himself, gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the
scabbard.
As to Dâ€™Artagnan, he remained standing like a man in consternation, with
the deepest affliction depicted on his face.
â€œAh, this is not right; Athos insults us; he wishes to die alone; it is

Mousqueton, witnessing this despair, melted into tears in a corner of
the room.

NA
NA

â€œWoe to that man who should happen to contradict my master at this

NA
They set out. On arriving at the Rue Saint Denis, the friends found a
vast concourse of people. It was the Duc de Beaufort, who was coming
from the Vendomois and whom the coadjutor was showing to the Parisians,
intoxicated with joy. With the dukeâ€™s aid they already considered

prince, and so reached the Saint Denis gate.

respectfully to let the two friends pass. Once across the barriers these
two knew neither fatigue nor fear. Their horses flew, and they never
ceased speaking of Athos and Aramis.
The camp had entered Saint Omer; the friends made a little detour and
went to the camp, and gave the army an exact account of the flight of
the king and queen. They found Raoul near his tent, reclining on a truss
of hay, of which his horse stole some mouthfuls; the young manâ€™s eyes
were red and he seemed dejected. The Marechal de Grammont and the Comte
de Guiche had returned to Paris and he was quite lonely. And as soon as
he saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms.
â€œOh, is it you, dear friends? Did you come here to fetch me? Will you

NA
â€œAlas! sir, no, and I do not know what has become of him; so that I am

In fact, tears rolled down his cheeks.

And having, meantime, embraced his ward, he passed him into the robust
arms of Porthos, who lifted him up from the ground and held him a moment
suspended near the noble heart of the formidable giant.
NA
And they set out for Boulogne, where toward evening they arrived, their
horses flecked with foam and dark with perspiration.
At ten steps from the place where they halted was a young man in black,
who seemed waiting for some one, and who, from the moment he saw them
enter the town, never took his eyes off them.
Dâ€™Artagnan approached him, and seeing him stare so fixedly, said:
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan thought it was some gossip who wanted news from the capital.
NA
NA
NA
â€œAre you not charged with a mission from his eminence, Cardinal

They both looked searchingly at the young man, who misunderstood the
meaning of that inquisition.

Besides, our supper canâ€™t delay you much. We will hasten on to the inn;

And the friends, spurring on their horses, rode to the hotel, the â€œArms

Cromwell; it would insure for us a poor reception, I imagine, should it

where they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the
port.
There they found a brig ready to set sail, upon the deck of which they
recognized Mordaunt walking up and down impatiently.

NA
A few minutes later they were on board, but the embarkation of the
horses was a longer matter than that of the men, and it was eight
oâ€™clock before they raised anchor.
The young man stamped impatiently and ordered all sail to be spread.
Porthos, completely used up by three nights without sleep and a journey
of seventy leagues on horseback, retired to his cabin and went to sleep.
Dâ€™Artagnan, overcoming his repugnance to Mordaunt, walked with him upon
the deck and invented a hundred stories to make him talk.
Mousqueton was seasick.
55. The Scotchman.
And now our readers must leave the Standard to sail peaceably, not
toward London, where Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos believed they were going,
but to Durham, whither Mordaunt had been ordered to repair by the letter
he had received during his sojourn at Boulogne, and accompany us to the
royalist camp, on this side of the Tyne, near Newcastle.
There, placed between two rivers on the borders of Scotland, but still
on English soil, the tents of a little army extended. It was midnight.
Some Highlanders were listlessly keeping watch. The moon, which was
partially obscured by heavy clouds, now and then lit up the muskets of
the sentinels, or silvered the walls, the roofs, and the spires of the
town that Charles I. had just surrendered to the parliamentary troops,
whilst Oxford and Newark still held out for him in the hopes of coming
to some arrangement.
At one of the extremities of the camp, near an immense tent, in which
the Scottish officers were holding a kind of council, presided over by
Lord Leven, their commander, a man attired as a cavalier lay sleeping on
the turf, his right hand extended over his sword.
About fifty paces off, another man, also appareled as a cavalier, was
talking to a Scotch sentinel, and, though a foreigner, he seemed to
understand without much difficulty the answers given in the broad
Perthshire dialect.
As the town clock of Newcastle struck one the sleeper awoke, and with
all the gestures of a man rousing himself out of deep sleep he looked
attentively about him; perceiving that he was alone he rose and making a
little circuit passed close to the cavalier who was speaking to the
sentinel. The former had no doubt finished his questions, for a moment
later he said good-night and carelessly followed the same path taken by
the first cavalier.
In the shadow of a tent the former was awaiting him.

added the lackey, raising the curtained entrance of the tent.
Lord Winter was seated near an aperture, arranged as a window to let in
the night air, his eyes mechanically following the course of the moon,
intermittently veiled, as we before observed, by heavy clouds. The two
friends approached Winter, who, with his head on his hands, was gazing
at the heavens; he did not hear them enter and remained in the same
attitude till he felt a hand upon his shoulder.
He turned around, recognized Athos and Aramis and held out his hand to
them.

Lord Winterâ€™s tent was pitched by the side of the royal marquee, a kind
of corridor communicating between the two. This corridor was guarded,
not by a sentinel, but by a confidential servant, through whom, in case
of urgency, Charles could communicate instantly with his faithful
subject.
NA
The lackey bowed and let them pass. As he had said, on a camp bed,
dressed in his black doublet, booted, unbelted, with his felt hat beside
him, lay the king, overcome by sleep and fatigue. They advanced, and
Athos, who was the first to enter, gazed a moment in silence on that
pale and noble face, framed in its long and now untidy, matted hair, the
blue veins showing through the transparent temples, his eyes seemingly
swollen by tears.
Athos sighed deeply; the sigh woke the king, so lightly did he sleep.
He opened his eyes.
NA

NA
NA
NA
â€œNever mind; the messenger is welcome. You never come to me without
conferring pleasure. You whose devotion recognizes neither country nor

face in his hands.

The king raised himself, buckled on his belt, and passing his
handkerchief over his moist forehead, said:
NA
â€œSire, have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly

Winter then left the tent; in the meantime the king finished his toilet.
The first rays of daybreak penetrated the aperture of the tent as Winter
re-entered it.

The king quitted his tent and found his horse ready waiting for him. It
was a chestnut that the king had ridden for three years and of which he
was very fond.
The horse neighed with pleasure at seeing him.
NA
NA
The horse, as if it understood these words, bent its red nostrils toward
the kingâ€™s face, and parting his lips displayed all its teeth, as if
with pleasure.
NA
NA
After this little scene Charles threw himself into the saddle, and
turning to Athos, Aramis and Winter, said:
NA
But Athos was standing with his eyes fixed on a black line which
bordered the banks of the Tyne and seemed to extend double the length of
the camp.
NA
by the uncertain shades and demi-tints of daybreak. â€œWhat is that line?
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œIt is the enemy, who have made a sortie from Newcastle and are
NA
NA
â€œYes, the enemy. It is too late. Stop a moment; does not that sunbeam
NA
This was the name given the cuirassiers, whom Cromwell had made his
body-guard.
NA
NA
NA
NA
And the king, putting spurs to his horse, set off to the tent of Lord
Leven.
NA
NA
NA
NA
He was stopped by Athos.
NA
NA
Winter turned his horse and the two friends rode on. It had taken but
two minutes for the king to reach the tent of the Scottish commander; he
dismounted and entered.
The general was there, surrounded by the more prominent chiefs.
NA
Charles was indeed in the midst of them, his hat on his head, his brows
bent, striking his boot with his riding whip.
â€œYes, gentlemen, the king in person, the king who has come to ask for

the enemy have left the town and are now closing the passages of the
Tyne against us; that our sentinels have seen this movement and I have
been left unacquainted with it; that, by an infamous treaty you have
sold me for two hundred thousand pounds to Parliament. Of this treaty,
at least, I have been warned. This is the matter, gentlemen; answer and

brows.

NA

â€œYour majesty is well aware that there is a truce between us and the

â€œAnd if there is a truce the English army has broken it by quitting the
town, contrary to the agreement which kept it there. Now, I tell you,

The eyes of the Scotch flashed fire; and, as often happens on such
occasions, from shame they passed to effrontery and two heads of clans
advanced upon the king.

him who for the last five-and-twenty years has sucked the blood and gold
of Scotland and England. We have promised and we will keep our promise.
NA
And both extended their hands as if to seize the king, but before they
could touch him with the tips of their fingers, both had fallen, one
dead, the other stunned.
Aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and Athos had
knocked down the other with the butt end of his pistol.
Then, as Lord Leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this
unexpected rescue, which seemed to come from Heaven for the prince they
already thought was their prisoner, Athos and Aramis dragged the king
from the perjured assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured,
and throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop
to the royal tent.
On their road they perceived Lord Winter marching at the head of his
regiment. The king motioned him to accompany them.
56. The Avenger.
They all four entered the tent; they had no plan ready--they must think
of one.
NA
NA
The king sighed deeply.
â€œBetrayed! yes betrayed by the Scotch, amongst whom I was born, whom I

NA

murmured Athos, thinking of Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos.
NA
â€œI say, sire, that there is now but one way open. Lord Winter answers
for his regiment, or at least very nearly so--we will not split straws
about words--let him place himself at the head of his men, we will place
ourselves at the side of your majesty, and we will mow a swath through

NA
and mount the kingâ€™s horse. Whilst they pursue him the king might

with admiration at these two men, whose chief idea seemed to be how they
could take on their shoulders all the dangers that assailed him.
â€œI think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed
by Monsieur dâ€™Herblay. I humbly entreat your majesty to choose quickly,
NA
â€œBut if I accept, it is death, or at least imprisonment, for him who

NA
The king looked at his old friend with tears in his eyes; undid the
Order of the Saint Esprit which he wore, to honor the two Frenchmen who
were with him, and passed it around Winterâ€™s neck, who received on his
knees this striking proof of his sovereignâ€™s confidence and friendship.
NA
NA
The king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his eyes.
NA
He turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up, and took out
two ribbons of the Order of the Garter.
NA
NA
NA
â€œSpeak not of crowns. I shall not find amongst them such great hearts as
yours. No, no, you do yourselves injustice; but I am here to do you
NA
Athos knelt down and the king passed the ribbon down from left to right
as usual, raised his sword, and instead of pronouncing the customary
NA
NA
Then turning to Aramis, he said:
NA
The same ceremony recommenced, with the same words, whilst Winter
unlaced his leather cuirass, that he might disguise himself like the
king. Charles, having proceeded with Aramis as with Athos, embraced them
both.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œSire, you have already done us more honor than simple gentlemen could
ever aspire to, therefore gratitude is on our side. But we must not lose
NA
The king again shook hands with all three, exchanged hats with Winter
and went out.
Winterâ€™s regiment was ranged on some high ground above the camp. The
king, followed by the three friends, turned his steps that way. The
Scotch camp seemed as if at last awakened; the soldiers had come out of
their tents and taken up their station in battle array.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
At the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same
line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning
sun now plainly showed was an army in order of battle. The air was soft
and clear, as it generally is at that early hour of the morning. The
regiments, the standards, and even the colors of the horses and uniforms
were now clearly distinct.
On the summit of a rising ground, a little in advance of the enemy,
appeared a short and heavy looking man; this man was surrounded by
officers. He turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the
king stood.
NA
Charles smiled.
NA
â€œThen draw down your hat, sire, that he may not discover the

NA
â€œListen, then, Lord Winter. Proceed, sire, I beg. What we are going to

The king, smiling, turned a few steps back.

regiments into two squadrons. You will put yourself at the head of the
first. We and his majesty will lead the second. If no obstacle occurs we
will both charge together, force the enemyâ€™s line and throw ourselves
into the Tyne, which we must cross, either by fording or swimming; if,
on the contrary, any repulse should take place, you and your men must
fight to the last man, whilst we and the king proceed on our road. Once
arrived at the brink of the river, should we even find them three ranks
deep, as long as you and your regiment do your duty, we will look to the

They mounted--the king on Winterâ€™s horse and Winter on that of the king;
then Winter took his place at the head of the first squadron, and the
king, with Athos on his right and Aramis on his left, at the head of the
second.
The Scotch army stood motionless and silent, seized with shame at sight
of these preparations.
Some of the chieftains left the ranks and broke their swords in two.
NA
NA
The first squadron moved off; the second followed, and descended from
the plateau. A regiment of cuirassiers, nearly equal as to numbers,
issued from behind the hill and came full gallop toward it.
The king pointed this out.
NA
NA
At this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the
horses Winterâ€™s voice crying out:
NA
At these words every sword was drawn, and glittered in the air like
lightning.
NA
NA
But Aramis and Athos were the only ones to obey this command and the
kingâ€™s example.

NA
NA
king, drawing up his horse with a sudden jerk, which threw it on its
haunches, and seizing the bridle of Athosâ€™s horse.
NA
whilst his men, quitting their ranks, dispersed all over the plain.
About fifteen men were ranged around him and awaited the charge of
Cromwellâ€™s cuirassiers.
NA
NA
NA
This voice was heard by the two friends, who set off, full gallop.
NA
which made them tremble.
As for Winter, at the sound of that voice he turned pale, and was, as it
were, petrified.
It was the voice of a cavalier mounted on a magnificent black horse, who
was charging at the head of the English regiment, of which, in his
ardor, he was ten steps in advance.

NA
NA
NA
NA
At the same moment Mordaunt, for it was he, leveled his pistol at
Winter; it went off and the ball entered the heart of the old cavalier,
who with one bound on his saddle fell back into the arms of Athos,
NA
NA
off at full gallop.
NA
the powder flashed in the pan and it did not go off.
At this moment the whole regiment came up and they fell upon the few men
who had held out, surrounding the two Frenchmen. Athos, after making
sure that Lord Winter was really dead, let fall the corpse and said:
NA

NA
glittered about their heads.
Suddenly a man sprang out of the English ranks, fell upon Athos, twined
arms of steel around him, and tearing his sword from him, said in his
ear:

A giant had seized also Aramisâ€™s two wrists, who struggled in vain to
release himself from this formidable grasp.

friends.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
And now the ranks began to open. Dâ€™Artagnan held the bridle of Athosâ€™s
horse and Porthos that of Aramis. Both of them attempted to lead his
prisoner off the battle-field.
This movement revealed the spot where Winterâ€™s body had fallen. Mordaunt
had found it out and was gazing on his dead relative with an expression
of malignant hatred.
Athos, though now cool and collected, put his hand to his belt, where
his loaded pistols yet remained.
NA
NA
â€œWe are all four lost, if by the least gesture you discover that you

Then turning to the young man he exclaimed:
â€œA fine prize! a fine prize, friend Mordaunt; we have both myself and

Dâ€™Artagnan vigorously seized his prisonerâ€™s hand, saying:
NA
NA
Porthos pressed his friendâ€™s hand and said to him:

At this instant the squadron, that ought to have protected Charlesâ€™s
retreat, was advancing to meet the English regiments. The king, who was
entirely surrounded, walked alone in a great empty space. He appeared
calm, but it was evidently not without a mighty effort. Drops of
perspiration trickled down his face, and from time to time he put a
handkerchief to his mouth to wipe away the blood that rilled from it.

The two gentlemen turned away their heads in silence.
NA
Charles shuddered. The demon had known how to wound him. The remembrance
of Strafford was a source of lasting remorse to him, the shadow that
haunted him by day and night. The king looked around him. He saw a
corpse at his feet. It was Winterâ€™s. He uttered not a word, nor shed a
tear, but a deadly pallor spread over his face; he knelt down on the
ground, raised Winterâ€™s head, and unfastening the Order of the Saint
Esprit, placed it on his own breast.

â€œCome, he was the first of us to go; peace be to him! he was an honest

NA
NA
The king drew his sword and broke it on his knee.
At this moment a horse without a rider, covered with foam, his nostrils
extended and eyes all fire, galloped up, and recognizing his master,
stopped and neighed with pleasure; it was Arthur.
The king smiled, patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the
saddle.

Turning back again, he said, â€œI thought I saw Winter move; if he still

The detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive; but on
the road an aide-de-camp, from Cromwell, sent orders that Colonel
Tomlison should conduct him to Holdenby Castle.
At the same time couriers started in every direction over England and
Europe to announce that Charles Stuart was the prisoner of Oliver
Cromwell.

The sergeant made a sign of comprehension.
Instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into
the town, Mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence
Cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent
pitched.
Cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission; but
the sentinel, who knew that Mordaunt was one of the most confidential
friends of the general, thought the order did not extend to the young
man. Mordaunt, therefore, raised the canvas, and saw Cromwell seated
before a table, his head buried in his hands, his back being turned.
Whether he heard Mordaunt or not as he entered, Cromwell did not move.
Mordaunt remained standing near the door. At last, after a few moments,
Cromwell raised his head, and, as if he divined that some one was there,
turned slowly around.
NA
â€œThey thought this order did not concern me, sir; nevertheless, if you

And Mordaunt darted out of the generalâ€™s tent, his heart beating and his
eyes sparkling with joy.
Cromwell gazed a moment after him.

interrupted by Mordaunt.
58. Jesus Seigneur.
Whilst Mordaunt was making his way to Cromwellâ€™s tent, Dâ€™Artagnan and
Porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned
to them as their dwelling at Newcastle.
The order given by Mordaunt to the sergeant had been heard by
Dâ€™Artagnan, who accordingly, by an expressive glance, warned Athos and
Aramis to exercise extreme caution. The prisoners, therefore, had
remained silent as they marched along in company with their
conquerors--which they could do with the less difficulty since each of
them had occupation enough in answering his own thoughts.
It would be impossible to describe Mousquetonâ€™s astonishment when from
the threshold of the door he saw the four friends approaching, followed
by a sergeant with a dozen men. He rubbed his eyes, doubting if he
really saw before him Athos and Aramis; and forced at last to yield to
evidence, he was on the point of breaking forth in exclamations when he
encountered a glance from the eyes of Porthos, the repressive force of
which he was not inclined to dispute.
Mousqueton remained glued to the door, awaiting the explanation of this
strange occurrence. What upset him completely was that the four friends
seemed to have no acquaintance with one another.
The house to which Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos conducted Athos and Aramis was
the one assigned to them by General Cromwell and of which they had taken
possession on the previous evening. It was at the corner of two streets
and had in the rear, bordering on the side street, stables and a sort of
garden. The windows on the ground floor, according to a custom in
provincial villages, were barred, so that they strongly resembled the
windows of a prison.
The two friends made the prisoners enter the house first, whilst they
stood at the door, desiring Mousqueton to take the four horses to the
stable.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan.
The sergeant and his men took possession of the little garden.
Dâ€™Artagnan asked them what they wished and why they had taken that
position.
NA
NA
There could be no fault to find with this arrangement; on the contrary,
it seemed to be a delicate attention, to be gratefully received;
Dâ€™Artagnan, therefore, thanked the man and gave him a crown piece to
drink to General Cromwellâ€™s health.
The sergeant answered that Puritans never drank, and put the crown piece
in his pocket.
NA
NA
NA
â€œâ€˜Tis true that our position is an awkward one; but let us go in and see
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan looked at Porthos with that air of wonder which a cunning man
cannot help feeling at displays of crass stupidity.
But as Porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment, he
NA
They found Athos in profound despondency; Aramis looked first at Porthos
and then at Dâ€™Artagnan, without speaking, but the latter understood his
meaningful look.
â€œYou want to know how we came here? â€˜Tis easily guessed. Mazarin sent us
NA
â€œBut how came you to fall into company with Mordaunt, whom I bade you
NA
NA
â€œMazarin again. Cromwell had sent him to Mazarin. Mazarin sent us to

â€œYes, you are right, Dâ€™Artagnan, a fatality that will separate and ruin
us! So, my dear Aramis, say no more about it and let us prepare to

â€œZounds! on the contrary, let us speak about it; for it was agreed among
us, once for all, that we should always hold together, though engaged on

NA
Ah! behold for what end the wretched Mazarin has made use of you. Do you
know in what crime you are to-day engaged? In the capture of a king, his

NA
NA
the lieutenant.
â€œGood heavens! we are on the very eve of it. I say, why is the king
taken prisoner? Those who wish to respect him as a master would not buy
him as a slave. Do you think it is to replace him on the throne that
Cromwell has paid for him two hundred thousand pounds sterling? They

taken an oath to obey, and I do obey; but you who have taken no such

honor to call us to their aid. We have served them to the best of our
poor means, and God will recompense the will, forgive the want of power.
You may see matters differently, Dâ€™Artagnan, and think otherwise. I will

because the kings of all countries are the first among gentlemen,
because the blind populace, ungrateful and brutal, always takes pleasure
in pulling down what is above them. And you, you, Dâ€™Artagnan, a man
sprung from the ancient nobility of France, bearing an honorable name,
carrying a good sword, have helped to give up a king to beersellers,
shopkeepers, and wagoners. Ah! Dâ€™Artagnan! perhaps you have done your
duty as a soldier, but as a gentleman, I say that you are very

Dâ€™Artagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower, unable to reply and
thoroughly uncomfortable; for when turned from the eyes of Athos he
encountered those of Aramis.

Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s embarrassment, â€œyou, the best heart, the best friend, the
best soldier that I know--you, with a soul that makes you worthy of a
birth on the steps of a throne, and who, sooner or later, must receive
your reward from an intelligent king--you, my dear Porthos, you, a
gentleman in manners, in tastes and in courage, you are as culpable as

Porthos blushed, but with pleasure rather than with confusion; and yet,
bowing his head, as if humiliated, he said:

Athos arose.

tone, at least with the feelings of a father. It would have been easier
to me merely to have thanked you for preserving my life and not to have

â€œDoubtless, doubtless, Athos. But here it is: you have sentiments, the
devil knows what, such as every one canâ€™t entertain. Who could suppose
that a sensible man could leave his house, France, his ward--a charming
youth, for we saw him in the camp--to fly to the aid of a rotten,
worm-eaten royalty, which is going to crumble one of these days like an
old hovel. The sentiments you air are certainly fine, so fine that they

â€œThat would be nothing for us four; it is too much for us two. No,
divided as we now are, we must perish. See the fatal example: on the
Vendomois road, Dâ€™Artagnan, you so brave, and you, Porthos, so valiant
and so strong--you were beaten; to-day Aramis and I are beaten in our
turn. Now that never happened to us when we were four together. Let us
die, then, as De Winter has died; as for me, I will fly only on

NA
â€œI know it and I have nothing more to say; my arguments lead to nothing;
doubtless they are bad, since they have not determined minds so just as

not to compromise two excellent friends like Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos. Be
assured, gentlemen, we shall do you honor in our dying. As for myself, I
shall be proud to face the bullets, or even the rope, in company with

Dâ€™Artagnan said nothing, but, after having gnawed the flower stalk, he
began to bite his nails. At last:
NA
should they do so? What interest have they in your death? Moreover, you
NA
NA
exchanged with him one look, yet that look convinced me that we were

â€œThe truth is, Iâ€™m very sorry that I did not strangle him as you advised
NA
NA
â€œCap de Diou! if he troubles me too much I will crush him, the insect!
Do not fly, then. It is useless; for I swear to you that you are as safe
here as you were twenty years, ago--you, Athos, in the Rue Ferou, and

NA
which the room was lighted; â€œyou will soon know what to expect, for here
NA
NA
NA
In fact, looking at the place to which Athos pointed, Dâ€™Artagnan saw a
cavalier coming toward the house at full gallop.
It was Mordaunt.
Dâ€™Artagnan rushed out of the room.
Porthos wanted to follow him.
NA
NA
When Mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw Dâ€™Artagnan on the
threshold and the soldiers lying on the grass here and there, with their
arms.
NA
NA
NA
Four men prepared to do so.
NA
readers have so often observed in him since they made his acquaintance.
NA
NA
NA
â€œWherefore, sir? Excuse curiosity, but I wish to be enlightened on the

â€œBecause these prisoners, sir, are at my disposal and I choose to

error. The prisoners belong to those who take them and not to those who
only saw them taken. You might have taken Lord Winter--who, â€˜tis said,
was your uncle--prisoner, but you preferred killing him; â€˜tis well; we,
that is, Monsieur du Vallon and I, could have killed our prisoners--we

Mordauntâ€™s very lips grew white with rage.
Dâ€™Artagnan now saw that affairs were growing worse and he beat the
guardâ€™s march upon the door. At the first beat Porthos rushed out and
stood on the other side of the door.
This movement was observed by Mordaunt.
NA
prisoners have just been given me by my illustrious patron, Oliver
NA
These words struck Dâ€™Artagnan like a thunderbolt. The blood mounted to
his temples, his eyes became dim; he saw from what fountainhead the
ferocious hopes of the young man arose, and he put his hand to the hilt
of his sword.
As for Porthos, he looked inquiringly at Dâ€™Artagnan.
This look of Porthosâ€™s made the Gascon regret that he had summoned the
brute force of his friend to aid him in an affair which seemed to
require chiefly cunning.

Mordaunt, delighted, advanced, Porthos looking at Dâ€™Artagnan with
open-mouthed astonishment. Then Dâ€™Artagnan trod on his foot and Porthos
began to understand that this was merely acting.
Mordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and, with his hat in
hand, prepared to pass by the two friends, motioning to the four men to
follow him.
NA
his hand on the young manâ€™s shoulder, â€œif the illustrious General Oliver
Cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour, he has, of

Mordaunt stopped short.
â€œHe has given you some little writing for me--the least bit of paper
which may show that you come in his name. Be pleased to give me that
scrap of paper so that I may justify, by a pretext at least, my
abandoning my countrymen. Otherwise, you see, although I am sure that
General Oliver Cromwell can intend them no harm, it would have a bad

Mordaunt recoiled; he felt the blow and discharged a terrible look at
Dâ€™Artagnan, who responded by the most amiable expression that ever
graced a human countenance.
NA
NA
NA
dear Monsieur Mordaunt! On the contrary, I take you to be a worthy and
accomplished gentleman. And then, sir, do you wish me to speak freely to
NA
NA
â€œMonsieur du Vallon, yonder, is rich and has forty thousand francs
yearly, so he does not care about money. I do not speak for him, but for
NA
NA
â€œWell--I--Iâ€™m not rich. In Gascony â€˜tis no dishonor, sir, nobody is
rich; and Henry IV., of glorious memory, who was the king of the
Gascons, as His Majesty Philip IV. is the king of the Spaniards, never

â€œGo on, sir, I see what you wish to get at; and if it is simply what I

NA
Well, hereâ€™s the case, hereâ€™s where the saddle hurts me, as we French
say. I am an officer of fortune, nothing else; I have nothing but what
my sword brings me in--that is to say, more blows than banknotes. Now,
on taking prisoners, this morning, two Frenchmen, who seemed to me of
high birth--in short, two knights of the Garter--I said to myself, my
fortune is made. I say two, because in such circumstances, Monsieur du
NA
Mordaunt, completely deceived by the wordy civility of Dâ€™Artagnan,
smiled like a man who understands perfectly the reasons given him, and
said:
â€œI shall have the order signed directly, sir, and with it two thousand
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
of traveling in your company you do not know us. We are gentlemen; we
are, both of us, able to kill you and your eight men--we two only. For
Heavenâ€™s sake donâ€™t be obstinate, for when others are obstinate I am
obstinate likewise, and then I become ferocious and headstrong, and
thereâ€™s my friend, who is even more headstrong and ferocious than
myself. Besides, we are sent here by Cardinal Mazarin, and at this
moment represent both the king and the cardinal, and are, therefore, as
ambassadors, able to act with impunity, a thing that General Oliver
Cromwell, who is assuredly as great a politician as he is a general, is
quite the man to understand. Ask him then, for the written order. What
NA
NA
NA
However inclined Mordaunt was to have recourse to violence, he
understood the reasons Dâ€™Artagnan had given him; besides, completely
ignorant of the friendship which existed between the four Frenchmen, all
his uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the plausible motive of the
ransom. He decided, therefore, not only to fetch the order, but the two
thousand pistoles, at which he estimated the prisoners. He therefore
mounted his horse and disappeared.
NA
NA
without the least change of countenance, to Porthos, he said, looking
him full in the face: â€œFriend Porthos, listen to this; first, not a
syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard; it is
NA
NA
â€œGo to the stable; you will find Mousqueton there; saddle your horses,
put your pistols in your saddle-bags, take out the horses and lead them
to the street below this, so that there will be nothing to do but mount

Porthos made no remark, but obeyed, with the sublime confidence he had
in his friend.
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, do me the kindness to take my purse, which I left on the

NA
He then proceeded, with his usual calm gait, to the stable and went into
the very midst of the soldiery, who, foreigner as he was, could not help
admiring his height and the enormous strength of his great limbs.
At the corner of the street he met Mousqueton and took him with him.
Dâ€™Artagnan, meantime, went into the house, whistling a tune which he had
begun before Porthos went away.
â€œMy dear Athos, I have reflected on your arguments and I am convinced. I
am sorry to have had anything to do with this matter. As you say,
Mazarin is a knave. I have resolved to fly with you, not a word--be
ready. Your swords are in the corner; do not forget them, they are in

He put it into his pocket. The two friends were perfectly stupefied.
NA
NA
The two friends went near him.
â€œDo you see that street? There are the horses. Go out by the door, turn
to the right, jump into your saddles, all will be right; donâ€™t be uneasy
at anything except mistaking the signal. That will be the signal when I
NA
NA
NA
NA
upset all that stands in our way, run to our horses, jump into our

NA
NA
said Athos.
NA
NA
as he came in, whistling the self-same air.
The soldiers were playing or sleeping; two of them were singing in a

Dâ€™Artagnan called the sergeant. â€œMy dear friend, General Cromwell has
sent Monsieur Mordaunt to fetch me. Guard the prisoners well, I beg of
NA
The sergeant made a sign, as much as to say he did not understand
French, and Dâ€™Artagnan tried to make him comprehend by signs and
gestures. Then he went into the stable; he found the five horses
saddled, his own amongst the rest.
NA
Mousqueton; â€œturn to the left, so that Athos and Aramis may see you
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Porthos and Mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to
their post.
Then Dâ€™Artagnan, being alone, struck a light and lighted a small bit of
tinder, mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the
soldiers. There, caressing as he pretended, the animal with his hand, he
put this bit of burning tinder in his ear. It was necessary to be as
good a horseman as he was to risk such a scheme, for no sooner had the
animal felt the burning tinder than he uttered a cry of pain and reared
and jumped as if he had been mad.
The soldiers, whom he was nearly trampling, ran away.
NA
In an instant the horseâ€™s eyes grew bloodshot and he was white with
foam.
NA
NA
No sooner had he uttered this cry than the door opened and Athos and
Aramis rushed out. The coast, owing to the Gasconâ€™s stratagem, was
clear.
NA
sergeant.
NA
darting forth, overturned several men.
NA
But the prisoners were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to
the nearest gate.
In the middle of the street they saw Grimaud and Blaisois, who were
coming to find their masters. With one wave of his hand Athos made
Grimaud, who followed the little troop, understand everything, and they
passed on like a whirlwind, Dâ€™Artagnan still directing them from behind
with his voice.
They passed through the gate like apparitions, without the guards
thinking of detaining them, and reached the open country.
NA
sergeant, who began to see that he was the victim of an artifice, was
almost in a frenzy of despair. Whilst all this was going on, a cavalier
in full gallop was seen approaching. It was Mordaunt with the order in
his hand.
NA
The sergeant had not the courage to reply; he showed him the open door,
the empty room. Mordaunt darted to the steps, understood all, uttered a
cry, as if his very heart was pierced, and fell fainting on the stone
steps.
59. Noble Natures never lose Courage, nor good Stomachs their Appetites.
The little troop, without looking behind them or exchanging a word, fled
at a rapid gallop, fording a little stream, of which none of them knew
the name, and leaving on their left a town which Athos declared to be
Durham. At last they came in sight of a small wood, and spurring their
horses afresh, rode in its direction.
As soon as they had disappeared behind a green curtain sufficiently
thick to conceal them from the sight of any one who might be in pursuit
they drew up to hold a council together. The two grooms held the horses,
that they might take a little rest without being unsaddled, and Grimaud
was posted as sentinel.

pressing his hand. â€œTo what are you not equal, with your superior
intelligence, infallible eye, your arm of iron and your enterprising

The two friends, recalled by Dâ€™Artagnan to what was also due to Porthos,
pressed his hand in their turn.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWe are going to reach the nearest seaport, unite our little resources,
hire a vessel and return to France. As for me I will give my last sou
for it. Life is the greatest treasure, and speaking candidly, ours hangs

Aramis contented himself by making a sign with his head.

he began to think he had to do with madmen.

A second look was exchanged between Athos and Aramis.
â€œAnd when the trial is ended there will be no delay in putting the

â€œThe penalty of death, I greatly fear; they have gone too far for him to
pardon them, and there is nothing left to them but one thing, and that
is to kill him. Have you never heard what Oliver Cromwell said when he

We engaged our word; our word included everything. It was our strength,

NA
NA
France at this moment everything is poor and paltry. We have a king ten
years old, who doesnâ€™t yet know what he wants; we have a queen blinded
by a belated passion; we have a minister who governs France as he would
govern a great farm--that is to say, intent only on turning out all the
gold he can by the exercise of Italian cunning and invention; we have
princes who set up a personal and egotistic opposition, who will draw
from Mazarinâ€™s hands only a few ingots of gold or some shreds of power
granted as bribes. I have served them without enthusiasm--God knows that
I estimated them at their real value, and that they are not high in my
esteem--but on principle. To-day I am engaged in a different affair. I
have encountered misfortune in a high place, a royal misfortune, a
European misfortune; I attach myself to it. If we can succeed in saving

â€œI traveled in England when I was young, I speak English like an
Englishman, and Aramis, too, knows something of the language. Ah! if we
had you, my friends! With you, Dâ€™Artagnan, with you, Porthos--all four
reunited for the first time for twenty years--we would dare not only
NA
NA
storm the Tower of London, to kill a hundred thousand soldiers, to fight
victoriously against the wishes of the nation and the ambition of a man,
and when that man is Cromwell? Do not exaggerate your duty. In Heavenâ€™s
name, my dear Athos, do not make a useless sacrifice. When I see you
merely, you look like a reasonable being; when you speak, I seem to have
to do with a madman. Come, Porthos, join me; say frankly, what do you
NA
NA
NA
to him Athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts, â€œyou have never
found yourself the worse for my advice. Well, then, believe me, Athos,
NA
NA
NA
Athos smiled and Dâ€™Artagnan struck his hands together in anger and
muttered the most convincing reasons that he could discover; but to all
these reasons Athos contented himself by replying with a calm, sweet
smile and Aramis by nodding his head.
NA
wish it, let us leave our bones in this beggarly land, where it is
always cold, where fine weather is a fog, fog is rain, and rain a
deluge; where the sun represents the moon and the moon a cream cheese;
in truth, whether we die here or elsewhere matters little, since we must

â€œPooh! a little sooner or a little later, it isnâ€™t worth quarreling

king saved--we shall assemble our friends together--we will head the
Puritans--reconquer England; we shall re-enter London--place him

NA
with joy at this imaginary prospect.

â€œWell, that has happened, friend Porthos. It seems to me that we once

we are trying to perform for Charles I.; but, none the less, Anne of

And the four friends, guided by Mousqueton, took up the way toward the
house, already almost restored to their former gayety; for they were
now, as Athos had said, all four once more united and of single mind.
60. Respect to Fallen Majesty.
As our fugitives approached the house, they found the ground cut up, as
if a considerable body of horsemen had preceded them. Before the door
the traces were yet more apparent; these horsemen, whoever they might
be, had halted there.
NA
NA
NA
NA
dismounted and knocked on the door. There was no response.
He pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted.
NA
NA
NA
NA
At this word the three friends leaped from their horses and entered.
Dâ€™Artagnan had already opened the door of the second room, and from the
expression of his face it was clear that he there beheld some
extraordinary object.
The three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the
ground, bathed in a pool of blood. It was evident that he had attempted
to regain his bed, but had not had sufficient strength to do so.
Athos, who imagined that he saw him move, was the first to go up to him.
NA
NA
NA
The wounded man heaved a sigh. Dâ€™Artagnan took some water in the hollow
of his hand and threw it upon his face. The man opened his eyes, made an
effort to raise his head, and fell back again. The wound was in the top
of his skull and blood was flawing copiously.
Aramis dipped a cloth into some water and applied it to the gash. Again
the wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these
strangers, who appeared to pity him.
NA
NA
NA
NA
The man made no reply.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Athos and Aramis remembered that this was the name by which De Winter
had called the man they had found in the passage of the kingâ€™s tent.
NA
â€œYes, that is he. Well, he thought of me, when he saw the king was
taken, and as they were passing before the house he begged in the kingâ€™s
name that they would stop, as the king was hungry. They brought him into
this room and placed sentinels at the doors and windows. Parry knew this
room, as he had often been to see me when the king was at Newcastle. He
knew that there was a trap-door communicating with a cellar, from which
one could get into the orchard. He made a sign, which I understood, but
the kingâ€™s guards must have noticed it and held themselves on guard. I
went out as if to fetch wood, passed through the subterranean passage
into the cellar, and whilst Parry was gently bolting the door, pushed up
the board and beckoned to the king to follow me. Alas! he would not. But
Parry clasped his hands and implored him, and at last he agreed. I went
on first, fortunately. The king was a few steps behind me, when suddenly
I saw something rise up in front of me like a huge shadow. I wanted to
cry out to warn the king, but that very moment I felt a blow as if the
house was falling on my head, and fell insensible. When I came to myself
again, I was stretched in the same place. I dragged myself as far as the
yard. The king and his escort were no longer there. I spent perhaps an
hour in coming from the yard to this place; then my strength gave out

â€œAlas, they have taken everything; there isnâ€™t a morsel of bread in the

They carried the man to his bed and called Grimaud to dress the wound.
In the service of the four friends Grimaud had had so frequent occasion
to make lint and bandages that he had become something of a surgeon.
In the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room, where they
took counsel together.

Athos did not reply; he reflected.

confounded country this England is! This is the first time I have gone
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Athosâ€™s eyes shone with joy.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Now, they will be far from looking for us among the Puritans; therefore,
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes. They will think we are trying to leave England and will search for
us at the ports; meanwhile we shall reach London with the king. Once in

of the fist, and I how to trip up a bull by taking him by the horns.

This was, as we have seen, the term which Athos applied to Dâ€™Artagnan in
his more expansive moods.
At this moment Grimaud came in. He had stanched the wound and the man
was better.
The four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any
message for him to his brother.

The little troop recommenced their march, and at the end of two hours
perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league ahead.

It was not long before they joined the escort. The king was riding in
front, surrounded by troopers, and when he saw Athos and Aramis a glow
of pleasure lighted his pale cheeks.
Dâ€™Artagnan passed to the head of the column, and leaving his friends
under the guard of Porthos, went straight to Harrison, who recognized
him as having met him at Cromwellâ€™s and received him as politely as a
man of his breeding and disposition could. It turned out as Dâ€™Artagnan
had foreseen. The colonel neither had nor could have any suspicion.
They halted for the king to dine. This time, however, due precautions
were taken to prevent any attempt at escape. In the large room of the
hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the officers.
NA
â€œGad, I should be very happy, but I have my companion, Monsieur du
Vallon, and the two prisoners, whom I cannot leave. Let us manage it
better. Have a table set for us in a corner and send us whatever you
NA
NA
The matter was arranged as Dâ€™Artagnan had suggested, and when he
returned he found the king already seated at his little table, where
Parry waited on him, Harrison and his officers sitting together at
another table, and, in a corner, places reserved for himself and his
companions.
The table at which the Puritan officers were seated was round, and
whether by chance or coarse intention, Harrison sat with his back to the
king.
The king saw the four gentlemen come in, but appeared to take no notice
of them.
They sat down in such a manner as to turn their backs on nobody. The
officers, table and that of the king were opposite to them.
NA
gracious invitation; for without you we ran the risk of going without
dinner, as we have without breakfast. My friend here, Monsieur du

to join you and took the road you had already gone by. You can
understand our disappointment when, arriving at a pretty little house on
the skirts of a wood, which at a distance had quite a gay appearance,
with its red roof and green shutters, we found nothing but a poor wretch
bathed--Ah! colonel, pay my respects to the officer of yours who struck

NA
NA
â€œThen, sir, allow me to assure you that your blow was so well directed
NA
NA
NA
As he said this, Dâ€™Artagnan gave a glance at Parry, who was standing in
front of the king, to show him that the news was meant for him.
The king, too, who had listened in the greatest agony, now breathed
again.
NA
NA
â€œAnd you would do well, if you are afraid of his recovering; for you
know, if a wound in the head does not kill at once, it is cured in a

And Dâ€™Artagnan threw a second glance toward Parry, on whose face such an
expression of joy was manifested that Charles stretched out his hand to
him, smiling.
Parry bent over his masterâ€™s hand and kissed it respectfully.
NA
NA
NA
Porthos looked at Dâ€™Artagnan, quite amazed at the resources with which
his companionâ€™s Gascon sharpness continually supplied him. Dâ€™Artagnan
took up his camp tin cup, filled it with wine and arose.
NA
Hereâ€™s to our colonel, and let him know that we are always at his

And as Dâ€™Artagnan, as he spoke, looked at Harrison, the colonel imagined
the toast was for himself. He arose and bowed to the four friends, whose
eyes were fixed on Charles, while Harrison emptied his glass without the
slightest misgiving.
The king, in return, looked at the four gentlemen and drank with a smile
full of nobility and gratitude.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA

Dâ€™Artagnan shrugged his shoulders and they proceeded.
61. Dâ€™Artagnan hits on a Plan.
As night closed in they arrived at Thirsk. The four friends appeared to
be entire strangers to one another and indifferent to the precautions
taken for guarding the king. They withdrew to a private house, and as
they had reason every moment to fear for their safety, they occupied but
one room and provided an exit, which might be useful in case of an
attack. The lackeys were sent to their several posts, except that
Grimaud lay on a truss of straw across the doorway.
Dâ€™Artagnan was thoughtful and seemed for the moment to have lost his
usual loquacity. Porthos, who could never see anything that was not
self-evident, talked to him as usual. He replied in monosyllables and
Athos and Aramis looked significantly at one another.
Next morning Dâ€™Artagnan was the first to rise. He had been down to the
stables, already taken a look at the horses and given the necessary
orders for the day, whilst Athos and Aramis were still in bed and
Porthos snoring.
At eight oâ€™clock the march was resumed in the same order as the night
before, except that Dâ€™Artagnan left his friends and began to renew the
acquaintance which he had already struck up with Monsieur Groslow.
Groslow, whom Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s praises had greatly pleased, welcomed him
with a gracious smile.
NA

a very melancholy disposition, so much so, that one can scarcely get
three words out of him all day. As for our two prisoners, you can

â€œOh, no! Just think. What would you have two men without arms do against
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes; Stuart begged this favor and Harrison consented. Under pretense
that heâ€™s a king it appears he cannot dress or undress without

NA
laudatory tack on which he had commenced, â€œthe more I listen to you the
more surprised I am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak
French. You have lived three years in Paris? May I ask what you were

â€œMy father, who is a merchant, placed me with his correspondent, who in

â€œYes, but you are much in want of a revolution like our own--not against

Mazarin if we had only a dozen officers like yourself, without

NA

â€œThat is to say I am in the kingâ€™s service, and that knowing he wanted
to send some one to England, I solicited the appointment, so great was
my desire to know the man of genius who now governs the three kingdoms.

â€œOn his right and left, sir. Ah! thereâ€™s another brave and excellent

â€œThe fact is, I look to my turn for keeping guard with horror. Itâ€™s

â€œI play with Monsieur du Vallon every night. Sometimes we donâ€™t go to

noble family. We have arranged the ransom of each of them--2,000 on
arriving in France. We are reluctant to leave for a single moment men
whom our lackeys know to be millionaires. It is true we plundered them a
little when we took them, and I will even confess that it is their purse
that Monsieur du Vallon and I draw on in our nightly play. Still, they
may have concealed some precious stone, some valuable diamond; so that
we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their
treasures. We have made ourselves the constant guardians of our men, and

NA
â€œYou see, then, why I must decline your polite invitation, which is
especially attractive to me, because nothing is so wearisome as to play

NA

him because they are afraid of him. Ah, there he is calling me now.

They exchanged bows and Dâ€™Artagnan returned to his companions.
NA
Porthos.
â€œMy dear fellow, donâ€™t speak like that of Monsieur Groslow. Heâ€™s one of

NA
â€œHush! my dear Porthos. Monsieur Groslow is perhaps rather hasty, itâ€™s
true, but at bottom I have discovered two good qualities in him--he is

Porthos opened his eyes in amazement; Athos and Aramis looked at one
another and smiled; they knew Dâ€™Artagnan, and knew that he did nothing
without a purpose.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWe invite him to play to-night; he has invited us in return to-morrow.
But wait. To-night we stop at Derby; and if there is a bottle of wine in
the town let Mousqueton buy it. It will be well to prepare a light
supper, of which you, Athos and Aramis, are not to partake--Athos,
because I told him you had a fever; Aramis, because you are a knight of
NA
NA
NA
â€œPorthos, my friend, you know I am descended on the fatherâ€™s side from
the Prophets and on the motherâ€™s from the Sybils, and that I only speak
in parables and riddles. Let those who have ears hear and those who have
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
pleasure to work miracles before them; they are not like that
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder, and as they had
reached the station where they were to breakfast, the conversation ended
there.
At five in the evening they sent Mousqueton on before as agreed upon.
Blaisois went with him.
In crossing the principal street in Derby the four friends perceived
Blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome house. It was there a
lodging was prepared for them.
At the hour agreed upon Groslow came. Dâ€™Artagnan received him as he
would have done a friend of twenty yearsâ€™ standing. Porthos scanned him
from head to foot and smiled when he discovered that in spite of the
blow he had administered to Parryâ€™s brother, he was not nearly so strong
as himself. Athos and Aramis suppressed as well as they could the
disgust they felt in the presence of such coarseness and brutality.
In short, Groslow seemed to be pleased with his reception.
Athos and Aramis kept themselves to their role. At midnight they
withdrew to their chamber, the door of which was left open on the
pretext of kindly consideration. Furthermore, Dâ€™Artagnan went with them,
leaving Porthos at play with Groslow.
Porthos gained fifty pistoles from Groslow, and found him a more
agreeable companion than he had at first believed him to be.
As to Groslow, he promised himself that on the following evening he
would recover from Dâ€™Artagnan what he had lost to Porthos, and on
leaving reminded the Gascon of his appointment.
The next day was spent as usual. Dâ€™Artagnan went from Captain Groslow to
Colonel Harrison and from Colonel Harrison to his friends. To any one
not acquainted with him he seemed to be in his normal condition; but to
his friends--to Athos and Aramis--was apparent a certain feverishness in
his gayety.
NA
NA
Porthos said nothing, but he handled in his pocket the fifty pistoles he
had gained from Groslow with a degree of satisfaction which betrayed
itself in his whole bearing.
Arrived at Ryston, Dâ€™Artagnan assembled his friends. His face had lost
the expression of careless gayety it had worn like a mask the whole day.
Athos pinched Aramisâ€™s hand.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
and when have you seen me trifle with a friendâ€™s heart and a kingâ€™s
life? I have told you, and I repeat it, that to-night we rescue Charles
NA
Porthos looked at Dâ€™Artagnan with an expression of profound admiration.
Aramis smiled as one who hopes. Athos was pale, and trembled in every
limb.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, gentlemen, in the kingâ€™s room. Groslow is on guard there this
evening, and to pass the time away he has invited us to keep him

NA
â€œPardieu! certainly, all four; we couldnâ€™t leave our prisoners, could

Athos placed his two hands on Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s shoulders, and gazed at him
with his calm, sad smile.

sky who equals you in prowess and in courage. Whilst we thought you
indifferent to our sorrows, which you couldnâ€™t share without crime, you
alone among us have discovered what we were searching for in vain. I
repeat it, Dâ€™Artagnan, you are the best one among us; I bless and love
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Athos shuddered and turned pale.
NA
NA
NA
â€œI have arranged two plans. Firstly, at a given signal, which shall be
the words â€˜At last,â€™ you each plunge a dagger into the heart of the
soldier nearest to you. We, on our side, do the same. That will be four
killed. We shall then be matched, four against the remaining five. If
these five men give themselves up we gag them; if they resist, we kill
them. If by chance our Amphitryon changes his mind and receives only
Porthos and myself, why, then, we must resort to heroic measures and
each give two strokes instead of one. It will take a little longer time
and may make a greater disturbance, but you will be outside with swords
NA
NA
NA
awkward. Besides, you will strike at the throat, Porthos; it kills as
NA
NA
NA
NA
battle. But if you think the kingâ€™s life is not worth what it must cost
NA
NA
At this moment a soldier entered to inform them that Groslow was waiting
for them.
NA
NA
Puritan.
NA
NA
The Puritan then went out. The lackeys had been ordered to saddle eight
horses and to wait, keeping together and without dismounting, at the
corner of a street about twenty steps from the house where the king was
lodged.
It was nine oâ€™clock in the evening; the sentinels had been relieved at
eight and Captain Groslow had been on guard for an hour. Dâ€™Artagnan and
Porthos, armed with their swords, and Athos and Aramis, each carrying a
concealed poniard, approached the house which for the time being was
Charles Stuartâ€™s prison. The two latter followed their captors in the
humble guise of captives, without arms.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan went up to him and whispered in his ear:
â€œThe fact is, we, that is, Monsieur du Vallon and I, hesitated a
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan looked significantly toward Athos and Aramis.
NA
NA
they shall see him.
NA
â€œNo, but in the one next to it, and as the door will remain open it
comes to the same thing. Have you provided yourself with money? I assure
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan rattled the gold in his pockets.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan turned to look at his friends. Porthos was perfectly
indifferent; Athos, pale, but resolute; Aramis was wiping a slight
moisture from his brow.
The eight guards were at their posts. Four in the kingâ€™s room, two at
the door between the rooms and two at that by which the friends had
entered. Athos smiled when he saw their bare swords; he felt it was no
longer to be a butchery, but a fight, and he resumed his usual good
humor.
Charles was perceived through the door, lying dressed upon his bed, at
the head of which Parry was seated, reading in a low voice a chapter
from the Bible.
A candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and
resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer, far less
calm.
From time to time Parry stopped, thinking the king, whose eyes were
closed, was really asleep, but Charles would open his eyes and say with
a smile:
NA
Groslow advanced to the door of the kingâ€™s room, replaced on his head
the hat he had taken off to receive his guests, looked for a moment
contemptuously at this simple, yet touching scene, then turning to
Dâ€™Artagnan, assumed an air of triumph at what he had achieved.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Groslowâ€™s face brightened.
It is impossible to say whether Charles, who kept his eyes constantly
closed, had noticed the insolence of the Puritan captain, but the moment
he heard the clear tone of Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s voice his eyelids rose, in spite
of himself.
Parry, too, started and stopped reading.
NA
NA
Parry resumed his reading.
On a table in the next room were lighted candles, cards, two dice-boxes,
and dice.
NA
facing Stuart, whom I like so much to see, especially where he now is,
NA
Athos turned red with rage. Dâ€™Artagnan frowned at him.
NA
right of Monsieur Groslow. You, Chevalier dâ€™Herblay, to his left. Du
Vallon next me. Youâ€™ll bet for me and those gentlemen for Monsieur
NA
By this arrangement Dâ€™Artagnan could nudge Porthos with his knee and
make signs with his eyes to Athos and Aramis.
At the names Comte de la Fere and Chevalier dâ€™Herblay, Charles opened
his eyes, and raising his noble head, in spite of himself, threw a
glance at all the actors in the scene.
At that moment Parry turned over several leaves of his Bible and read
with a loud voice this verse in Jeremiah:
â€œGod said, â€˜Hear ye the words of the prophets my servants, whom I have
NA
The four friends exchanged glances. The words that Parry had read
assured them that their presence was understood by the king and was
assigned to its real motive. Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s eyes sparkled with joy.
NA
twenty pistoles upon the table. â€œWell, in my turn I advise you to keep a
sharp lookout on your treasure, my dear Monsieur Groslow, for I can tell
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Charles had heard and understood it all. A slight color mounted to his
cheeks. The soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs, little by little,
and under the pretense of much heat throw off the Scotch plaid which
covered him.
Athos and Aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying
with his clothes on.
The game began. The luck had turned, and Groslow, having won some
hundred pistoles, was in the merriest possible humor.
Porthos, who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before and
thirty more besides, was very cross and questioned Dâ€™Artagnan with a
nudge of the knee as to whether it would not soon be time to change the
game. Athos and Aramis looked at him inquiringly. But Dâ€™Artagnan
remained impassible.
It struck ten. They heard the guard going its rounds.
NA
pistoles from his pocket.
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan glanced at Athos and Aramis and for the first time replied to
Porthosâ€™s nudge of the knee by a nudge responsive. Meanwhile, the
soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the kingâ€™s room, attracted by
that love of play so powerful in all men, had stolen little by little
toward the table, and standing on tiptoe, lounged, watching the game,
over the shoulders of Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos. Those on the other side
had followed their example, thus favoring the views of the four friends,
who preferred having them close at hand to chasing them about the
chamber. The two sentinels at the door still had their swords
unsheathed, but they were leaning on them while they watched the game.
Athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached. With his
white, aristocratic hands he played with the louis, bending and
straightening them again, as if they were made of pewter. Aramis, less
self-controlled, fumbled continually with his hidden poniard. Porthos,
impatient at his continued losses, kept up a vigorous play with his
knee.
Dâ€™Artagnan turned, mechanically looking behind him, and between the
figures of two soldiers he could see Parry standing up and Charles
leaning on his elbow with his hands clasped and apparently offering a
fervent prayer to God.
Dâ€™Artagnan saw that the moment was come. He darted a preparatory glance
at Athos and Aramis, who slyly pushed their chairs a little back so as
to leave themselves more space for action. He gave Porthos a second
nudge of the knee and Porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and took
care at the same time to ascertain that his sword could be drawn
smoothly from the scabbard.
NA
NA
and he drew another twenty from his pocket. â€œOne more turn, captain;
NA
NA
And he turned up two cards as usual, a king for Dâ€™Artagnan and an ace
for himself.
NA
NA
And in spite of his extraordinary self-control there was a strange
vibration in the Gasconâ€™s voice which made his partner start.
Groslow began turning the cards one after another. If he turned up an
ace first he won; if a king he lost.
He turned up a king.
NA
At this word Athos and Aramis jumped up. Porthos drew back a step.
Daggers and swords were just about to shine, when suddenly the door was
thrown open and Harrison appeared in the doorway, accompanied by a man
enveloped in a large cloak. Behind this man could be seen the glistening
muskets of half a dozen soldiers.
Groslow jumped up, ashamed at being surprised in the midst of wine,
cards, and dice. But Harrison paid not the least attention to him, and
entering the kingâ€™s room, followed by his companion:

NA
Dâ€™Artagnan swept up the money that he and Porthos had lost and buried it
in his huge pocket. Athos and Aramis placed themselves behind him. At
this movement Mordaunt turned around, recognized them, and uttered an
exclamation of savage delight.
NA
NA
NA
Frenchmen have escaped from Newcastle, and no doubt want to carry off

his sword around him.
The next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the
soldiers who guarded it, before they had time to cock their muskets.
Athos and Aramis followed him. Porthos brought up the rear, and before
soldiers, officers, or colonel had time to recover their surprise all
four were in the street.
NA
Three or four shots were fired, but with no other result than to show
the four fugitives turning the corner of the street safe and sound.
The horses were at the place fixed upon, and they leaped lightly into
their saddles.

They galloped away and took the road they had come by in the morning,
namely, in the direction toward Scotland. A few hundred yards beyond the

There was a stream close by and a bridge across it.
Dâ€™Artagnan led his horse under the arch of the bridge. The others
followed. Ten minutes later they heard the rapid gallop of a troop of
horsemen. A few minutes more and the troop passed over their heads.

As soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance Dâ€™Artagnan
remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain, followed by his
three friends, directing their course, as well as they could guess,
toward London.

The friends urged on their horses and arrived, in fact, at about five
oâ€™clock in the morning. They were stopped and questioned at the gate by
which they sought to enter the city, but Athos replied, in excellent
English, that they had been sent forward by Colonel Harrison to announce
to his colleague, Monsieur Bridge, the approach of the king. That reply
led to several questions about the kingâ€™s capture, and Athos gave
details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any
suspicions they vanished completely. The way was therefore opened to the
four friends with all sorts of Puritan congratulations.
Athos was right. He went direct to the Bedford Tavern, and the host, who
recognized him, was delighted to see him again with such a numerous and
promising company.
Though it was scarcely daylight our four travelers found the town in a
great bustle, owing to the reported approach of Harrison and the king.
The plan of changing their clothes was unanimously adopted. The landlord
sent out for every description of garment, as if he wanted to fit up his
wardrobe. Athos chose a black coat, which gave him the appearance of a
respectable citizen. Aramis, not wishing to part with his sword,
selected a dark-blue cloak of a military cut. Porthos was seduced by a
wine-colored doublet and sea-green breeches. Dâ€™Artagnan, who had fixed
on his color beforehand, had only to select the shade, and looked in his
chestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar dealer.

They had not been long in the crowd before loud cries announced the
kingâ€™s arrival. A carriage had been sent to meet him, and the gigantic
Porthos, who stood a head above the entire rabble, soon announced that
he saw the royal equipage approaching. Dâ€™Artagnan raised himself on
tiptoe, and as the carriage passed, saw Harrison at one window and
Mordaunt at the other.
The next day, Athos, leaning out of his window, which looked upon the
most populous part of the city, heard the Act of Parliament, which
summoned the ex-king, Charles I., to the bar, publicly cried.

63. The Trial.
The next morning King Charles I. was haled by a strong guard before the
high court which was to judge him. All London was crowding to the doors
of the house. The throng was terrific, and it was not till after much
pushing and some fighting that our friends reached their destination.
When they did so they found the three lower rows of benches already
occupied; but being anxious not to be too conspicuous, all, with the
exception of Porthos, who had a fancy to display his red doublet, were
quite satisfied with their places, the more so as chance had brought
them to the centre of their row, so that they were exactly opposite the
arm-chair prepared for the royal prisoner.
Toward eleven oâ€™clock the king entered the hall, surrounded by guards,
but wearing his head covered, and with a calm expression turned to every
side with a look of complete assurance, as if he were there to preside
at an assembly of submissive subjects, rather than to meet the
accusations of a rebel court.
The judges, proud of having a monarch to humiliate, evidently prepared
to enjoy the right they had arrogated to themselves, and sent an officer
to inform the king that it was customary for the accused to uncover his
head.
Charles, without replying a single word, turned his head in another
direction and pulled his felt hat over it. Then when the officer was
gone he sat down in the arm-chair opposite the president and struck his
boots with a little cane which he carried in his hand. Parry, who
accompanied him, stood behind him.
Dâ€™Artagnan was looking at Athos, whose face betrayed all those emotions
which the king, possessing more self-control, had banished from his own.
This agitation in one so cold and calm as Athos, frightened him.
NA
NA
NA
NA
something or other; for look, the sentinels are being reinforced. They
had only halberds before, now they have muskets. The halberds were for
NA
NA
reinforcements.
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan grew pale with rage. He recognized Mordaunt, who with bare
sword was marshalling the musketeers behind the king and opposite the
benches.
NA
NA
NA
Dieu! how he stares at him, the insolent dog! Does he hate his majesty
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The king turned his head away, as if these words had not been intended
for him. Bradshaw waited, and as there was no reply there was a moment
of silence.
Out of the hundred and sixty-three members designated there were only
seventy-three present, for the rest, fearful of taking part in such an
act, had remained away.
When the name of Colonel Fairfax was called, one of those brief but
solemn silences ensued, which announced the absence of the members who
had no wish to take a personal part in the trial.

A loud laugh followed these words, pronounced with that boldness which
women draw from their own weakness--a weakness which removes them beyond
the power of vengeance.

The roll call finished, the president ordered them to read the act of
accusation. Athos turned pale. A second time he was disappointed in his
expectation. Notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to
continue; the king then, was condemned in advance.
NA
take your courage in both hands and hear what this gentleman in black is
NA
Never till then had a more brutal accusation or meaner insults tarnished
kingly majesty.
Charles listened with marked attention, passing over the insults, noting
the grievances, and, when hatred overflowed all bounds and the accuser
turned executioner beforehand, replying with a smile of lofty scorn.

musketeers who parody the musketeers of France. Meantime, Dâ€™Artagnan,
who is full of invention, would find some way to save the king. I must

As to Athos, his face aflame, his fists clinched, his lips bitten till
they bled, he sat there foaming with rage at that endless parliamentary
insult and that long enduring royal patience; the inflexible arm and
steadfast heart had given place to a trembling hand and a body shaken by
excitement.
At this moment the accuser concluded with these words: â€œThe present
NA
At these words there was a murmur along the benches, and a second voice,
not that of a woman, but a manâ€™s, stout and furious, thundered behind
Dâ€™Artagnan.
NA
NA
This voice was that of Athos, who, standing up with outstretched hand
and quite out of his mind, thus assailed the public accuser.
King, judges, spectators, all turned their eyes to the bench where the
four friends were seated. Mordaunt did the same and recognized the
gentleman, around whom the three other Frenchmen were standing, pale and
menacing. His eyes glittered with delight. He had discovered those to
whose death he had devoted his life. A movement of fury called to his
side some twenty of his musketeers, and pointing to the bench where his
NA
But with the rapidity of thought Dâ€™Artagnan seized Athos by the waist,
and followed by Porthos with Aramis, leaped down from the benches,
rushed into the passages, and flying down the staircase were lost in the
crowd without, while the muskets within were pointed on some three
thousand spectators, whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the
impulse already given to bloodshed.
Charles also had recognized the four Frenchmen. He put one hand on his
heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes, that he might
not witness the slaying of his faithful friends.
Mordaunt, pale and trembling with anger, rushed from the hall sword in
hand, followed by six pikemen, pushing, inquiring and panting in the
crowd; and then, having found nothing, returned.
The tumult was indescribable. More than half an hour passed before any
one could make himself heard. The judges were looking for a new outbreak
from the benches. The spectators saw the muskets leveled at them, and
divided between fear and curiosity, remained noisy and excited.
Quiet was at length restored.
NA
Then rising, with his head still covered, in the tone of a judge rather
than a prisoner, Charles began.

talent of your government. But because you have paid the price of a
slave, do you imagine that I have ceased to be your king? No. To answer
you would be to forget it. I shall only reply to you when you have
satisfied me of your right to question me. To answer you would be to

â€œIt is--but you will not look, will you?--it is because they have had

NA

When the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the hall. As
he passed the table on which the axe was laid, he stopped, and turning
with a smile, said:
â€œAh! the axe, an ingenious device, and well worthy of those who know not

touching it with the cane which he held in his hand, â€œand I strike you
NA
And shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed on. When
he reached the door a stream of people, who had been disappointed in not
being able to get into the house and to make amends had collected to see
him come out, stood on each side, as he passed, many among them glaring
on him with threatening looks.
NA
And as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind, a
voice beside him said:
NA
The king turned quickly around, with tears in his eyes and heart. It was
an old soldier of the guards who could not see his king pass captive
before him without rendering him this final homage. But the next moment
the unfortunate man was nearly killed with heavy blows of sword-hilts,
and among those who set upon him the king recognized Captain Groslow.
NA
NA
He continued his walk, but he had scarcely gone a hundred paces, when a
furious fellow, leaning between two soldiers, spat in the kingâ€™s face,
as once an infamous and accursed Jew spit in the face of Jesus of
Nazareth. Loud roars of laughter and sullen murmurs arose together. The
crowd opened and closed again, undulating like a stormy sea, and the
king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the
bright eyes of Athos.
Charles wiped his face and said with a sad smile: â€œPoor wretch, for half
NA
The king was not mistaken. Athos and his friends, again mingling with
the throng, were taking a last look at the martyr king.
When the soldier saluted Charles, Athosâ€™s heart bounded for joy; and
that unfortunate, on coming to himself, found ten guineas that the
French gentleman had slipped into his pocket. But when the cowardly
insulter spat in the face of the captive monarch Athos grasped his
dagger. But Dâ€™Artagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried,
NA
Athos stopped. Dâ€™Artagnan, leaning on Athos, made a sign to Porthos and
Aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the
bare arms, who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and
receiving the congratulations of several others.
The man took his way toward the city. The four friends followed him. The
man, who had the appearance of being a butcher, descended a little steep
and isolated street, looking on to the river, with two of his friends.
Arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were
followed, turned around, and looking insolently at the Frenchmen, passed
some jests from one to another.
NA
NA
Then quickening their steps they passed the three men, but turned back
immediately, and Dâ€™Artagnan walked straight up to the butcher and
touching him on the chest with the tip of his finger, said to Athos:
â€œSay this to him in English: â€˜You are a coward. You have insulted a
defenseless man. You have befouled the face of your king. You must

Athos, pale as a ghost, repeated these words to the man, who, seeing the
bodeful preparations that were making, put himself in an attitude of
defense. Aramis, at this movement, drew his sword.
NA
And seizing the butcher by the throat:
NA
Porthos raised his terrible fist, which whistled through the air like a
sling, and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the
insulterâ€™s skull and crushed it. The man fell like an ox beneath the
poleaxe. His companions, horror-struck, could neither move nor cry out.

Athos repeated Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s words.
The fellows looked at the body of their companion, swimming in blood,
and then recovering voice and legs together, ran screaming off.

64. Whitehall.
The parliament condemned Charles to death, as might have been foreseen.
Political judgments are generally vain formalities, for the same
passions which give rise to the accusation ordain to the condemnation.
Such is the atrocious logic of revolutions.
Although our friends were expecting that condemnation, it filled them
with grief. Dâ€™Artagnan, whose mind was never more fertile in resources
than in critical emergencies, swore again that he would try all
conceivable means to prevent the denouement of the bloody tragedy. But
by what means? As yet he could form no definite plan; all must depend on
circumstances. Meanwhile, it was necessary at all hazards, in order to
gain time, to put some obstacle in the way of the execution on the
following day--the day appointed by the judges. The only way of doing
that was to cause the disappearance of the London executioner. The
headsman out of the way, the sentence could not be executed. True, they
could send for the headsman of the nearest town, but at least a day
would be gained, and a day might be sufficient for the rescue.
Dâ€™Artagnan took upon himself that more than difficult task.
Another thing, not less essential, was to warn Charles Stuart of the
attempt to be made, so that he might assist his rescuers as much as
possible, or at least do nothing to thwart their efforts. Aramis assumed
that perilous charge. Charles Stuart had asked that Bishop Juxon might
be permitted to visit him. Mordaunt had called on the bishop that very
evening to apprise him of the religious desire expressed by the king and
also of Cromwellâ€™s permission. Aramis determined to obtain from the
bishop, through fear or by persuasion, consent that he should enter in
the bishopâ€™s place, and clad in his sacerdotal robes, the prison at
Whitehall.
Finally, Athos undertook to provide, in any event, the means of leaving
England--in case either of failure or of success.
The night having come they made an appointment to meet at eleven oâ€™clock
at the hotel, and each started out to fulfill his dangerous mission.
The palace of Whitehall was guarded by three regiments of cavalry and by
the fierce anxiety of Cromwell, who came and went or sent his generals
or his agents continually. Alone in his usual room, lighted by two
candles, the condemned monarch gazed sadly on the luxury of his past
greatness, just as at the last hour one sees the images of life more
mildly brilliant than of yore.
Parry had not quitted his master, and since his condemnation had not
ceased to weep. Charles, leaning on a table, was gazing at a medallion
of his wife and daughter; he was waiting first for Juxon, then for
martyrdom.
At times he thought of those brave French gentlemen who had appeared to
him from a distance of a hundred leagues fabulous and unreal, like the
forms that appear in dreams. In fact, he sometimes asked himself if all
that was happening to him was not a dream, or at least the delirium of a
fever. He rose and took a few steps as if to rouse himself from his
torpor and went as far as the window; he saw glittering below him the
muskets of the guards. He was thereupon constrained to admit that he was
indeed awake and that his bloody dream was real.
Charles returned in silence to his chair, rested his elbow on the table,
bowed his head upon his hand and reflected.
NA
lights of the church, whose soul has sounded all the mysteries of life,
all the littlenesses of greatness, perhaps his utterance would overawe
the voice that wails within my soul. But I shall have a priest of vulgar
mind, whose career and fortune I have ruined by my misfortune. He will
speak to me of God and death, as he has spoken to many another dying
man, not understanding that this one leaves his throne to an usurper,
NA
And he raised the medallion to his lips.
It was a dull, foggy night. A neighboring church clock slowly struck the
hour. The flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom
shadows in the lofty room. These were the ancestors of Charles, standing
back dimly in their tarnished frames.
An awful sadness enveloped the heart of Charles. He buried his brow in
his hands and thought of the world, so beautiful when one is about to
leave it; of the caresses of children, so pleasing and so sweet,
especially when one is parting from his children never to see them
again; then of his wife, the noble and courageous woman who had
sustained him to the last moment. He drew from his breast the diamond
cross and the star of the Garter which she had sent him by those
generous Frenchmen; he kissed it, and then, as he reflected, that she
would never again see those things till he lay cold and mutilated in the
tomb, there passed over him one of those icy shivers which may be called
forerunners of death.
Then, in that chamber which recalled to him so many royal souvenirs,
whither had come so many courtiers, the scene of so much flattering
homage, alone with a despairing servant, whose feeble soul could afford
no support to his own, the king at last yielded to sorrow, and his
courage sank to a level with that feebleness, those shadows, and that
wintry cold. That king, who was so grand, so sublime in the hour of
death, meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips, now in
that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and
quivered on the gold embroidered cloth.
Suddenly the door opened, an ecclesiastic in episcopal robes entered,
followed by two guards, to whom the king waved an imperious gesture. The
guards retired; the room resumed its obscurity.
NA
NA
The bishop looked anxiously at the man sobbing in the ingle-nook.
NA
NA
NA
At this sight and this voice Charles was about to cry out, when Aramis
placed his finger on his lips and bowed low to the king of England.
NA
NA
NA
Charles clasped his hands, amazed and stupefied to find that these
foreigners, without other motive than that which their conscience
imposed on them, thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a
king.
NA
NA
â€œCare not for me, sire; think only of yourself. You see, your friends
are wakeful. I know not what we shall do yet, but four determined men
can do much. Meanwhile, do not be surprised at anything that happens;
NA
Charles shook his head.
NA
â€œSomething, your majesty, will happen between now and then to make the

The king looked at Aramis with astonishment.
At this moment a strange noise, like the unloading of a cart, and
followed by a cry of pain, was heard beneath the window.

NA
NA

window? Well, these boards you hear unloaded are the posts and planks to

Aramis shuddered in spite of himself.

Aramis stooped to kiss the kingâ€™s hand, but Charles clasped his and
pressed it to his heart.
At this moment a man entered, without even knocking at the door. Aramis
tried to withdraw his hand, but the king still held it. The man was one
of those Puritans, half preacher and half soldier, who swarmed around
Cromwell.

The king accompanied him to the door, where Aramis pronounced his
benediction upon him, and passing through the ante-rooms, filled with
soldiers, jumped into his carriage and drove to the bishopâ€™s palace.
Juxon was waiting for him impatiently.
NA
â€œEverything has succeeded as I expected; spies, guards, satellites, all
took me for you, and the king blesses you while waiting for you to bless

Aramis resumed his own attire and left Juxon with the assurance that he
might again have recourse to him.
He had scarcely gone ten yards in the street when he perceived that he
was followed by a man, wrapped in a large cloak. He placed his hand on
his dagger and stopped. The man came straight toward him. It was
Porthos.

forth workmenâ€™s clothes, which the four friends immediately put on; they
then left the hotel, Athos carrying a saw, Porthos a vise, Aramis an axe
and Dâ€™Artagnan a hammer and some nails.
The letter from the executionerâ€™s assistant satisfied the master
carpenter that those were the men he expected.
65. The Workmen.
Toward midnight Charles heard a great noise beneath his window. It arose
from blows of hammer and hatchet, clinking of pincers and cranching of
saws.
Lying dressed upon his bed, the noise awoke him with a start and found a
gloomy echo in his heart. He could not endure it, and sent Parry to ask
the sentinel to beg the workmen to strike more gently and not disturb
the last slumber of one who had been their king. The sentinel was
unwilling to leave his post, but allowed Parry to pass.
Arriving at the window Parry found an unfinished scaffold, over which
they were nailing a covering of black serge. Raised to the height of
twenty feet, so as to be on a level with the window, it had two lower
stories. Parry, odious as was this sight to him, sought for those among
some eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise; and fixed on
two men, who were loosening the last hooks of the iron balcony.
NA
them, â€œwould you work a little more quietly? The king wishes to get a
NA
One of the two, who was standing up, was of gigantic size and was
driving a pick with all his might into the wall, whilst the other,
kneeling beside him, was collecting the pieces of stone. The face of the
first was lost to Parry in the darkness; but as the second turned around
and placed his finger on his lips Parry started back in amazement.
NA
â€œTell the king that if he sleeps badly to-night he will sleep better
NA
These blunt words, so terrible if taken literally, were received by the
other workmen with a roar of laughter. But Parry withdrew, thinking he
was dreaming.
Charles was impatiently awaiting his return. At the moment he
re-entered, the sentinel who guarded the door put his head through the
opening, curious as to what the king was doing. The king was lying on
his bed, resting on his elbow. Parry closed the door and approaching the
king, his face radiant with joy:
NA
NA
NA
Parry bent his head and whispered to the king: â€œIt is the Comte de la
NA
NA
NA
The king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to Heaven; then leaping
down from his bed he went to the window, and pulling aside the curtain
tried to distinguish the figures outside, but in vain.
Parry was not wrong. It was Athos he had recognized, and Porthos who was
boring a hole through the wall.
This hole communicated with a kind of loft--the space between the floor
of the kingâ€™s room and the ceiling of the one below it. Their plan was
to pass through the hole they were making into this loft and cut out
from below a piece of the flooring of the kingâ€™s room, so as to form a
kind of trap-door.
Through this the king was to escape the next night, and, hidden by the
black covering of the scaffold, was to change his dress for that of a
workman, slip out with his deliverers, pass the sentinels, who would
suspect nothing, and so reach the skiff that was waiting for him at
Greenwich.
Day gilded the tops of the houses. The aperture was finished and Athos
passed through it, carrying the clothes destined for the king wrapped in
black cloth, and the tools with which he was to open a communication
with the kingâ€™s room. He had only two hoursâ€™ work to do to open
communication with the king and, according to the calculations of the
four friends, they had the entire day before them, since, the
executioner being absent, another must be sent for to Bristol.
Dâ€™Artagnan returned to change his workmanâ€™s clothes for his
chestnut-colored suit, and Porthos to put on his red doublet. As for
Aramis, he went off to the bishopâ€™s palace to see if he could possibly
pass in with Juxon to the kingâ€™s presence. All three agreed to meet at
noon in Whitehall Place to see how things went on.
Before leaving the scaffold Aramis had approached the opening where
Athos was concealed to tell him that he was about to make an attempt to
gain another interview with the king.
NA
the condition of affairs. Say to him that when he is alone it will help
us if he will knock on the floor, for then I can continue my work in
safety. Try, Aramis, to keep near the king. Speak loud, very loud, for
they will be listening at the door. If there is a sentinel within the
apartment, kill him without hesitation. If there are two, let Parry kill
one and you the other. If there are three, let yourself be slain, but
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, go; but urge the king strongly not to stand on false generosity.
While you are fighting if there is a fight, he must flee. The trap once
replaced over his head, you being on the trap, dead or alive, they will
need at least ten minutes to find the hole by which he has escaped. In
those ten minutes we shall have gained the road and the king will be

â€œEverything shall be done as you say, Athos. Your hand, for perhaps we

Athos put his arm around Aramisâ€™s neck and embraced him.
NA
a son, and embrace him for me. Embrace also our good and brave Porthos.
NA
NA
NA
Aramis parted from Athos, went down from the scaffold in his turn and
took his way to the hotel, whistling the air of a song in praise of
Cromwell. He found the other two friends sitting at table before a good
fire, drinking a bottle of port and devouring a cold chicken. Porthos
was cursing the infamous parliamentarians; Dâ€™Artagnan ate in silence,
revolving in his mind the most audacious plans.
Aramis related what had been agreed upon. Dâ€™Artagnan approved with a
movement of the head and Porthos with his voice.
NA
What with Dâ€™Artagnan, Grimaud and Mousqueton, we can manage to dispatch
eight of them. I say nothing about Blaisois, for he is only fit to hold
the horses. Two minutes a man makes four minutes. Mousqueton will lose
another, thatâ€™s five; and in five minutes we shall have galloped a

Aramis swallowed a hasty mouthful, gulped a glass of wine and changed
his clothes.
NA
NA
â€œAll right. Grimaud has relieved Mousqueton and has his foot on the

NA
NA
Aramis again presented himself at the bishopâ€™s. Juxon consented the more
readily to take him with him, as he would require an assistant priest in
case the king should wish to communicate. Dressed as Aramis had been the
night before, the bishop got into his carriage, and the former, more
disguised by his pallor and sad countenance than his deaconâ€™s dress, got
in by his side. The carriage stopped at the door of the palace.
It was about nine oâ€™clock in the morning.
Nothing was changed. The ante-rooms were still full of soldiers, the
passages still lined by guards. The king was already sanguine, but when
he perceived Aramis his hope turned to joy. He embraced Juxon and
pressed the hand of Aramis. The bishop affected to speak in a loud
voice, before every one, of their previous interview. The king replied
that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit, and that
he desired another under the same conditions. Juxon turned to those
present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alone with the
king. Every one withdrew. As soon as the door was closed:

your majestyâ€™s window--the cry we heard was his--and there is no

The king did so, and the moment after, three muffled knocks, answering
the given signal, sounded beneath the floor.

other that you hear beneath your feet, and for two others also, who,

Meanwhile, the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly, when
suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the passage. Aramis seized the
poker and gave the signal to stop; the noise came nearer and nearer. It
was that of a number of men steadily approaching. The four men stood
motionless. All eyes were fixed on the door, which opened slowly and
with a kind of solemnity.
A parliamentary officer, clothed in black and with a gravity that
augured ill, entered, bowed to the king, and unfolding a parchment, read
the sentence, as is usually done to criminals before their execution.
NA
Juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than Aramis
about it.
NA
NA
â€œThen I must die like a common criminal by the hand of the London

â€œThe London executioner has disappeared, your majesty, but a man has
offered his services instead. The execution will therefore only be

NA
A slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that Charles
evinced, as he learned these tidings. But Aramis was livid. His heart
ceased beating, he closed his eyes and leaned upon the table. Charles
perceived it and took his hand.
NA
â€œSir, I am ready. There is but little reason why I should delay you.
Firstly, I wish to communicate; secondly, to embrace my children and bid

Aramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned aloud.

Juxon sat down, and the king, kneeling humbly before him, began his
confession.
66. Remember!
The mob had already assembled when the confession terminated. The kingâ€™s
children next arrived--the Princess Charlotte, a beautiful, fair-haired
child, with tears in her eyes, and the Duke of Gloucester, a boy eight
or nine years old, whose tearless eyes and curling lip revealed a
growing pride. He had wept all night long, but would not show his grief
before the people.
Charlesâ€™s heart melted within him at the sight of those two children,
whom he had not seen for two years and whom he now met at the moment of
death. He turned to brush away a tear, and then, summoning up all his
firmness, drew his daughter toward him, recommending her to be pious and
resigned. Then he took the boy upon his knee.
NA

not forget that. Perhaps some day they will want to make you king,
instead of the Prince of Wales, or the Duke of York, your elder
brothers. But you are not the king, my son, and can never be so while
they are alive. Swear to me, then, never to let them put a crown upon
your head unless you have a legal right to the crown. For one
day--listen, my son--one day, if you do so, they will doom you to
destruction, head and crown, too, and then you will not be able to die
NA
The child stretched out his little hand toward that of his father and
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
their fatherâ€™s neck.
NA
NA
Juxon led them away, and this time the doors were left open.
Meanwhile, Athos, in his concealment, waited in vain the signal to
recommence his work. Two long hours he waited in terrible inaction. A
deathlike silence reigned in the room above. At last he determined to
discover the cause of this stillness. He crept from his hole and stood,
hidden by the black drapery, beneath the scaffold. Peeping out from the
drapery, he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers around the
scaffold and the first ranks of the populace swaying and groaning like
the sea.
NA
wind-swayed cloth he was holding back. â€œThe people are hurrying on, the
soldiers under arms, and among the spectators I see Dâ€™Artagnan. What is
he waiting for? What is he looking at? Good God! have they allowed the
NA
Suddenly the dull beating of muffled drums filled the square. The sound
of heavy steps was heard above his head. The next moment the very planks
of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession, and
the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the
bottom of his heart had prevented him till then believing. At the same
moment a well-known voice above him pronounced these words:
NA
Athos shuddered from head to foot. It was the king speaking on the
scaffold.
In fact, after taking a few drops of wine and a piece of bread, Charles,
weary of waiting for death, had suddenly decided to go to meet it and
had given the signal for movement. Then the two wings of the window
facing the square had been thrown open, and the people had seen silently
advancing from the interior of the vast chamber, first, a masked man,
who, carrying an axe in his hand, was recognized as the executioner. He
approached the block and laid his axe upon it. Behind him, pale indeed,
but marching with a firm step, was Charles Stuart, who advanced between
two priests, followed by a few superior officers appointed to preside at
the execution and attended by two files of partisans who took their
places on opposite sides of the scaffold.
The sight of the masked man gave rise to a prolonged sensation. Every
one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could be
who presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the
promised spectacle, when the people believed it had been postponed until
the following day. All gazed at him searchingly.
But they could discern nothing but a man of middle height, dressed in
black, apparently of a certain age, for the end of a gray beard peeped
out from the bottom of the mask that hid his features.
The kingâ€™s request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative
sign, for in firm, sonorous accents, which vibrated in the depths of
Athosâ€™s heart, the king began his speech, explaining his conduct and
counseling the welfare of the kingdom.
NA
hear and that I see what I see? Is it possible that God has abandoned
His representative on earth and left him to die thus miserably? And I

A noise was heard like that the instrument of death would make if moved
upon the block.
NA
At the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around upon the
people. Then unfastening the diamond ornament which the queen had sent
him, he placed it in the hands of the priest who accompanied Juxon. Then
he drew from his breast a little cross set in diamonds, which, like the
order, had been the gift of Henrietta Maria.
NA
NA
NA
He then took his hat from his head and threw it on the ground. One by
one he undid the buttons of his doublet, took it off and deposited it by
the side of his hat. Then, as it was cold, he asked for his gown, which
was brought to him.
All the preparations were made with a frightful calmness. One would have
thought the king was going to bed and not to his coffin.
NA
NA
Charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the
mask of the unknown headsman. His calm, noble gaze forced the man to
turn away his head. But after the searching look of the king he
encountered the burning eyes of Aramis.
The king, seeing that he did not reply, repeated his question.
NA
NA
The king parted his hair with his hands, and looking at the block he
said:
NA
NA
NA
NA
three words that everybody, except the king, shuddered.
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhen I shall lay my head on the block and say â€˜Remember!â€™ then strike
NA
NA
the tempest; I go before you to a kingdom which knows no storms.
NA
He looked at Aramis and made a special sign to him with his head.
NA
NA

Then he knelt down, made the sign of the cross, and lowering his face to
the planks, as if he would have kissed them, said in a low tone, in

all I speak to you. To maintain a cause which I believed sacred I have

that this money exists. Make use of it, then, whenever you think it will

A momentâ€™s silence ensued and then, in a full, sonorous voice, the king

He had scarcely uttered the word when a heavy blow shook the scaffold
and where Athos stood immovable a warm drop fell upon his brow. He
reeled back with a shudder and the same moment the drops became a
crimson cataract.
Athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or
stunned. At last he rose and taking his handkerchief steeped it in the
blood of the martyred king. Then as the crowd gradually dispersed he
leaped down, crept from behind the drapery, glided between two horses,
mingled with the crowd and was the first to arrive at the inn.
Having gained his room he raised his hand to his face, and observing
that his fingers were covered with the monarchâ€™s blood, fell down
insensible.
67. The Man in the Mask.
The snow was falling thick and icy. Aramis was the next to come in and
to discover Athos almost insensible. But at the first words he uttered
the comte roused himself from the kind of lethargy in which he had sunk.
NA
NA
NA
NA

â€œNo, but I heard all. God preserve me from another such hour as I have

â€œYes, there were some people on the way who delayed me. The wretches

most to do with was some minutes before he could speak, so I took

the crowd, admirably placed for seeing; and as on the whole the sight

NA
NA
This reproof stung Athos to the heart, but as the impression produced by
seeing Dâ€™Artagnan foremost in a coarse, ferocious crowd had been very
strong, he contented himself with replying:
â€œI am not calumniating you, my friend. They were anxious about you here;
I simply told them where you were. You didnâ€™t know King Charles; to you

So saying, he stretched out his hand, but the other pretended not to see
it and he let it drop again slowly by his side.

Athos turned pale. Every reproach his friend uttered struck deeply in
his heart.
NA
NA
NA

â€œThanks, my worthy friend. So I have a little adventure to propose to

NA
â€œWell, while I was watching--not the king, as monsieur le comte thinks,
for I know what it is to see a man led to death, and though I ought to
be accustomed to the sight it always makes me ill--while I was watching
the masked executioner, the idea came to me, as I said, to find out who
he was. Now, as we are wont to complete ourselves each by all the rest
and to depend on one another for assistance, as one calls his other hand
to aid the first, I looked around instinctively to see if Porthos was
there; for I had seen you, Aramis, with the king, and you, count, I knew
NA
added, offering Athos his hand, â€œfor you must have suffered much. I was
looking around for Porthos when I saw near me a head which had been
broken, but which, for better or worse, had been patched with plaster
and with black silk. â€˜Humph!â€™ thought I, â€˜that looks like my handiwork;
I fancy I must have mended that skull somewhere or other.â€™ And, in fact,
it was that unfortunate Scotchman, Parryâ€™s brother, you know, on whom
Groslow amused himself by trying his strength. Well, this man was making
signs to another at my left, and turning around I recognized the honest
Grimaud. â€˜Oh!â€™ said I to him. Grimaud turned round with a jerk,
recognized me, and pointed to the man in the mask. â€˜Eh!â€™ said he, which
meant, â€˜Do you see him?â€™ â€˜Parbleu!â€™ I answered, and we perfectly
understood one another. Well, everything was finished as you know. The
mob dispersed. I made a sign to Grimaud and the Scotchman, and we all
three retired into a corner of the square. I saw the executioner return
into the kingâ€™s room, change his clothes, put on a black hat and a large
cloak and disappear. Five minutes later he came down the grand
NA
NA
â€œI should think so, but not without difficulty. Every few minutes he
turned around, and thus obliged us to conceal ourselves. I might have
gone up to him and killed him. But I am not selfish, and I thought it
might console you all a little to have a share in the matter. So we
followed him through the lowest streets in the city, and in half an
hourâ€™s time he stopped before a little isolated house. Grimaud drew out
a pistol. â€˜Eh?â€™ said he, showing it. I held back his arm. The man in the
mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key; but before he placed
it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being followed. Grimaud
and I got behind a tree, and the Scotchman having nowhere to hide
himself, threw himself on his face in the road. Next moment the door

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, in my absence havenâ€™t I put in my place Grimaud and the
Scotchman? Before he had taken ten steps beyond the door I had examined
the house on all sides. At one of the doors, that by which he had
entered, I placed our Scotchman, making a sign to him to follow the man
wherever he might go, if he came out again. Then going around the house
I placed Grimaud at the other exit, and here I am. Our game is beaten
NA
Athos threw himself into Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s arms.
NA

NA
NA
NA
â€œAh! just so. Cromwell is stout and short, and this man thin and lanky,

NA
NA

soldier, nor was it the gait of a horseman. If I am not mistaken we have

NA
NA
NA
NA

NA
The four friends resumed their own clothes, girded on their swords,
ordered Mousqueton and Blaisois to pay the bill and to arrange
everything for immediate departure, and wrapped in their large cloaks
left in search of their game.
The night was dark, snow was falling, the streets were silent and
deserted. Dâ€™Artagnan led the way through the intricate windings and
narrow alleys of the city and ere long they had reached the house in
question. For a moment Dâ€™Artagnan thought that Parryâ€™s brother had
disappeared; but he was mistaken. The robust Scotchman, accustomed to
the snows of his native hills, had stretched himself against a post, and
like a fallen statue, insensible to the inclemency of the weather, had
allowed the snow to cover him. He rose, however, as they approached.
NA
NA
â€œDonâ€™t be in a hurry to weave crowns for our Scotchman. I believe the
fellow is here on his own account, for I have heard that these gentlemen
born beyond the Tweed are very vindictive. I should not like to be

All four came up together. Grimaud continued to climb like a cat and
succeeded at last in catching hold of a hook, which served to keep one
of the shutters back when opened. Then resting his foot on a small ledge
he made a sign to show all was right.
NA
Grimaud showed his closed hand, with two fingers spread out.
NA
NA
â€œGood. And the man opposite to you is----
NA
NA

The four friends looked at one another.

And as if struck in the heart he let go the hook and dropped with a
groan.

Dâ€™Artagnan, Porthos and Aramis uttered a cry of joy.
Athos stepped back and passed his hand across his brow.

68. Cromwellâ€™s House.
It was, in fact, Mordaunt whom Dâ€™Artagnan had followed, without knowing
it. On entering the house he had taken off his mask and imitation beard,
then, mounting a staircase, had opened a door, and in a room lighted by
a single lamp found himself face to face with a man seated behind a
desk.
This man was Cromwell.
Cromwell had two or three of these retreats in London, unknown except to
the most intimate of his friends. Mordaunt was among these.
NA
NA
NA
â€œI am always curious to see the downfall of your honorâ€™s enemies, and he
was not among the least of them. But you, general, were you not at

There was a momentâ€™s silence.

â€œNone. I have been here since the morning. I only know that there was a

NA
Mordaunt bowed with a smile of triumphant ferocity.
NA
NA
NA
Mordaunt tried for a moment to read in the generalâ€™s face if this was
simply a useless question, or whether he knew everything. But his
piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of
Cromwellâ€™s.
NA
It was now Cromwellâ€™s turn to look fixedly at Mordaunt, and Mordaunt to
make himself impenetrable.
NA

Mordaunt remembered that Cromwell had told him he had had no detailed
account, and he was now quite convinced that the general had been
present at the execution, hidden behind some screen or curtain.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAnd who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that
NA
NA
king, who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this way.
Perhaps it was some man of rank who had grave reasons for hating the
fallen king, and who, learning that the king was about to flee and
escape him, threw himself in the way, with a mask on his face and an axe
in his hand, not as substitute for the executioner, but as an ambassador

overtaken by Godâ€™s. You see now why I did not care to know your
gentleman in the mask; for really, in spite of his excellent intentions,

Cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well
concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have
discovered it. It closed after him with a spring. This door communicated
with a subterranean passage, leading under the street to a grotto in the
garden of a house about a hundred yards from that of the future
Protector.
It was just before this that Grimaud had perceived the two men seated
together.

Grimaud began to scale the wall again.
â€œKeep guard at the other door, Athos and Aramis. Porthos and I will stay
NA
The friends obeyed.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Porthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabbard.
NA
NA
NA
NA

Grimaud leaped down. The snow deadened the noise of his fall.
â€œNow go and tell Athos and Aramis to stand on each side of the door and

The next moment the door opened and Mordaunt appeared on the threshold,
face to face with Dâ€™Artagnan. Porthos clapped his hands and the other
two came running around. Mordaunt was livid, but he uttered no cry nor
called for assistance. Dâ€™Artagnan quietly pushed him in again, and by
the light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward
one by one, keeping his eyes all the time on Mordauntâ€™s hands, who,
however, knowing that it was useless, attempted no resistance. At last
they stood face to face in the very room where ten minutes before
Mordaunt had been talking to Cromwell.
Porthos came up behind, and unhooking the lamp on the staircase relit
that in the room. Athos and Aramis entered last and locked the door
behind them.
NA
Mordaunt, who sat down, pale but calm. Aramis, Porthos and Dâ€™Artagnan
drew their chairs near him. Athos alone kept away and sat in the
furthest corner of the room, as if determined to be merely a spectator
of the proceedings. He seemed to be quite overcome. Porthos rubbed his
hands in feverish impatience. Aramis bit his lips till the blood came.
Dâ€™Artagnan alone was calm, at least in appearance.
NA
long, chance has at last brought us together, let us have a little

69. Conversational.
Though Mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted
the stairs in such utter confusion, when once seated he recovered
himself, as it were, and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of
escape. His eye wandered to a long stout sword on his flank and he
instinctively slipped it around within reach of his right hand.
Dâ€™Artagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said nothing.
Aramis muttered to himself, â€œWe shall hear nothing but the usual
NA
Porthos sucked his mustache, muttering, â€œA good deal of ceremony
NA
and motionless as a bas-relief.
The silence, however, could not last forever. So Dâ€™Artagnan began:
NA

do, whom the Cardinal Mazarin brought over from Bergamo and whom he
NA
Mordaunt did not reply.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and
NA
â€œWell, that is scarcely the question. I had the honor of asking you why
you altered your costume. The mask and beard became you very well, and
as to the axe, I do not think it would be out of keeping even at this
NA
â€œBecause, remembering the scene at Armentieres, I thought I should find
NA
NA
young; I shall therefore overlook your frivolous remarks. What took
place at Armentieres has no connection whatever with the present
occasion. We could scarcely have requested your mother to take a sword
NA
NA
once to the provocation.
Porthos rose, always ready for this kind of adventure.
NA
will arrange the matter rather better. Confess, Monsieur Mordaunt, that

NA
â€œThen, my dear sir; I am convinced that these gentlemen return your kind
wishes and will be delighted to kill you also. Of course they will do so

So saying, he threw his hat on the ground, pushed back his chair to the
wall and bowed to Mordaunt with true French grace.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Athos did not move. He might have been taken for a statue. Even his
breathing seemed to be arrested.
NA
Mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you afterward. You can
see it in his eye. So pray keep your places, like Athos, whose calmness
is entirely laudable. Besides, we will have no words about it. I have
particular business to settle with this gentleman and I shall and will

Porthos and Aramis drew back, disappointed, and drawing his sword
Dâ€™Artagnan turned to his adversary:
NA
â€œAnd for my part, gentlemen, I admire you. You are disputing which shall
fight me first, but you do not consult me who am most concerned in the
matter. I hate you all, but not equally. I hope to kill all four of you,
but I am more likely to kill the first than the second, the second than
the third, and the third than the last. I claim, then, the right to
choose my opponent. If you refuse this right you may kill me, but I

Athos and Dâ€™Artagnan said nothing, but their silence seemed to imply
consent.

Athos sprang up, but after an instant of motionless silence he said, to
the astonishment of his friends, â€œMonsieur Mordaunt, a duel between us

Mordaunt sustained this new attack without wincing. He stood with his
arms folded, apparently as calm as any man could be in such
circumstances. If he had not courage he had what is very like it,
namely, pride.
Aramis went to Cromwellâ€™s desk, tore off three bits of paper of equal
size, wrote on the first his own name and on the others those of his two
companions, and presented them open to Mordaunt, who by a movement of
his head indicated that he left the matter entirely to Aramis. He then
rolled them separately and put them in a hat, which he handed to
Mordaunt.
Mordaunt put his hand into the hat, took out one of the three papers and
disdainfully dropped it on the table without reading it.
NA
NA
Aramis opened the paper, and in a voice trembling with hate and
NA
The Gascon uttered a cry of joy and turning to Mordaunt:

NA
point on his boot.
The moment that Dâ€™Artagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his
man would not escape him, he recovered his usual tranquillity. He turned
up his cuffs neatly and rubbed the sole of his right boot on the floor,
but did not fail, however, to remark that Mordaunt was looking about him
in a singular manner.
NA
NA
casting at his opponent a look it would be impossible to describe.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œIs it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that, my little

shaking his head doubtfully.

â€œIn that case, gentlemen, have the kindness to retire into the corners,

This new attack made no impression on Mordaunt. The space was cleared,
the two lamps placed on Cromwellâ€™s desk, in order that the combatants
might have as much light as possible; and the swords crossed.
Dâ€™Artagnan was too good a swordsman to trifle with his opponent. He made
a rapid and brilliant feint which Mordaunt parried.
NA
And without losing a minute, thinking he saw an opening, he thrust his
right in and forced Mordaunt to parry a counter en quarte so fine that
the point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding ring.
This time it was Mordaunt who smiled.
NA
NA
Mordaunt replied by trying his opponentâ€™s weapon with an amount of
strength which the Gascon was astonished to find in a form apparently so
feeble; but thanks to a parry no less clever than that which Mordaunt
had just achieved, he succeeded in meeting his sword, which slid along
his own without touching his chest.
Mordaunt rapidly sprang back a step.
â€œAh! you lose ground, you are turning? Well, as you please, I even gain
something by it, for I no longer see that wicked smile of yours. You
have no idea what a false look you have, particularly when you are
afraid. Look at my eyes and you will see what no looking-glass has ever
NA
To this flow of words, not perhaps in the best taste, but characteristic
of Dâ€™Artagnan, whose principal object was to divert his opponentâ€™s
attention, Mordaunt did not reply, but continuing to turn around he
succeeded in changing places with Dâ€™Artagnan.
He smiled more and more sarcastically and his smile began to make the
Gascon anxious.
NA
turn he pressed Mordaunt hard, who continued to lose ground, but
evidently on purpose and without letting his sword leave the line for a
moment. However, as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go
on like that forever, Mordauntâ€™s foot at last touched the wall, against
which he rested his left hand.
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan. â€œGentlemen, did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall?
NA
In a second Dâ€™Artagnan had made three terrible thrusts at Mordaunt, all
of which touched, but only pricked him. The three friends looked on,
panting and astonished. At last Dâ€™Artagnan, having got up too close,
stepped back to prepare a fourth thrust, but the moment when, after a
fine, quick feint, he was attacking as sharply as lightning, the wall
seemed to give way, Mordaunt disappeared through the opening, and
Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s blade, caught between the panels, shivered like a sword of
glass. Dâ€™Artagnan sprang back; the wall had closed again.
Mordaunt, in fact, while defending himself, had manoeuvred so as to
reach the secret door by which Cromwell had left, had felt for the knob
with his left hand, pressed it and disappeared.
The Gascon uttered a furious imprecation, which was answered by a wild
laugh on the other side of the iron panel.

So, suiting the action to the word, Dâ€™Artagnan thrust the remnant of his
sword into its scabbard, picked up his hat and ran down the stairs,
followed by the others.
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan had judged correctly; Mordaunt felt that he had no time to
lose, and he lost none. He knew the rapidity of decision and action that
characterized his enemies and resolved to act with reference to that.
This time the musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of them.
After closing the door carefully behind him Mordaunt glided into the
subterranean passage, sheathing on the way his now useless sword, and
thus reached the neighboring house, where he paused to examine himself
and to take breath.

Mordaunt proceeded at a rapid pace to the nearest cavalry barracks,
about a quarter of a league distant. He made that quarter of a league in
four or five minutes. Arrived at the barracks he made himself known,
took the best horse in the stables, mounted and gained the high road. A
quarter of an hour later he was at Greenwich.

added, rising in the stirrups and looking about him, â€œwhich, I wonder,

At this moment, as if in reply to his words, a man lying on a coil of
cables rose and advanced a few steps toward him. Mordaunt drew a
handkerchief from his pocket, and tying a knot at each corner--the
signal agreed upon--waved it in the air and the man came up to him. He
was wrapped in a large rough cape, which concealed his form and partly
his face.
NA
NA
â€œAnd perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than another. You

They then went down to the Thames. A boat was fastened to the shore by a
chain fixed to a stake. Groslow jumped in, followed by Mordaunt, and in
five minutes they were quite away from that world of houses which then
crowded the outskirts of London; and Mordaunt could discern the little
vessel riding at anchor near the Isle of Dogs. When they reached the
side of this felucca, Mordaunt, dexterous in his eagerness for
vengeance, seized a rope and climbed up the side of the vessel with a
coolness and agility very rare among landsmen. He went with Groslow to
the captainâ€™s berth, a sort of temporary cabin of planks, for the chief
apartment had been given up by Captain Rogers to the passengers, who
were to be accommodated at the other end of the boat.
NA
NA
â€œThatâ€™s a capital arrangement. Return to Greenwich and bring them here.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œFasten it to the poop with a rope; put the oars into it, so that it may
follow in the track and there will be nothing to do except to cut the
cord. Put a good supply of rum and biscuit in it for the seamen; should

NA
â€œNo. When you return I will set the fuse myself, but be careful to

NA
NA
Groslow, then, having given the sailor on duty an order to be on the
watch with more than usual vigilance, went down into the longboat and
soon reached Greenwich. The wind was chilly and the jetty was deserted,
as he approached it; but he had no sooner landed than he heard a noise
of horses galloping upon the paved road.
These horsemen were our friends, or rather, an avant garde, composed of
Dâ€™Artagnan and Athos. As soon as they arrived at the spot where Groslow
stood they stopped, as if guessing that he was the man they wanted.
Athos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corner,
whilst Dâ€™Artagnan, ever cautious, remained on horseback, one hand upon
his pistol, leaning forward watchfully.
On seeing the appointed signal, Groslow, who had at first crept behind
one of the cannons planted on that spot, walked straight up to the
gentlemen. He was so well wrapped up in his cloak that it would have
been impossible to see his face even if the night had not been so dark
as to render precaution superfluous; nevertheless, the keen glance of
Athos perceived at once it was not Rogers who stood before them.
NA
NA
feigned of course, â€œthat if you are looking for Captain Rogers you will
not find him. He fell down this morning and broke his leg. But Iâ€™m his
cousin; he told me everything and desired me to watch instead of him,
and in his place to conduct, wherever they wished to go, the gentlemen
who should bring me a handkerchief tied at each corner, like that one

And he drew out the handkerchief.
NA
â€œNo, my lord; he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds if I landed

in English.

NA
NA

â€œMy dear friend, you guess well. My father meant me for the navy and I

NA
They then summoned their friends, who, with Blaisois, Mousqueton and
Grimaud, promptly joined them, leaving Parry behind them, who was to
take back to London the horses of the gentlemen and of their lackeys,
which had been sold to the host in settlement of their account with him.
Thanks to this stroke of business the four friends were able to take
away with them a sum of money which, if not large, was sufficient as a
provision against delays and accidents.
Parry parted from his friends regretfully; they had proposed his going
with them to France, but he had straightway declined.
NA
It was Captain Groslow, the reader will remember, who had broken Parryâ€™s
head.
Dâ€™Artagnan resumed immediately the attitude of distrust that was
habitual with him. He found the wharf too completely deserted, the night
too dark, the captain too accommodating. He had reported to Aramis what
had taken place, and Aramis, not less distrustful than he, had increased
his suspicions. A slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed
Athos of the Gasconâ€™s uneasiness.

first, in order to test the plank leading from the pier to the boat.
The three valets passed without accident. Athos followed them, then
Porthos, then Aramis. Dâ€™Artagnan went last, still shaking his head.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œEverything goes too well, Porthos. But no matter; we must trust in

As soon as the plank was withdrawn the captain took his place at the
tiller and made a sign to one of the sailors, who, boat-hook in hand,
began to push out from the labyrinth of boats in which they were
involved. The other sailor had already seated himself on the port side
and was ready to row. As soon as there was room for rowing, his
companion rejoined him and the boat began to move more rapidly.
NA
NA
â€œYes; but all four together and without a scratch; which is a

They went on board and the captain instantly conducted them to the berth
prepared for them--a cabin which was to serve for all purposes and for
the whole party; he then tried to slip away under pretext of giving
orders to some one.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Groslow, on the question being interpreted, answered, â€œThree, without

descended to the lower deck.
This was divided into three compartments--one which was covered by the
floor of that room in which Athos, Porthos and Aramis were to pass the
night; the second was to serve as the sleeping-room for the servants,
the third, under the prow of the ship, was under the temporary cabin in
which Mordaunt was concealed.

preceded by the lantern, â€œwhat a number of barrels! one would think one

The captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again, but controlling
himself he answered:

Grimaud translated the question, and Groslow, who was wiping the
perspiration from off his forehead, answered:

Dâ€™Artagnan struck the barrels with his hand, and having ascertained that
he spoke the truth, pushed his lantern, greatly to the captainâ€™s alarm,
into the interstices between the barrels, and finding that there was
nothing concealed in them:
NA
compartment.
NA
opened the door, with a trembling hand, into the second compartment,
where Mousqueton and Blaisois were preparing supper.
Here there was evidently nothing to seek or to apprehend and they passed
rapidly to examine the third compartment.
This was the room appropriated to the sailors. Two or three hammocks
hung upon the ceiling, a table and two benches composed the entire
furniture. Dâ€™Artagnan picked up two or three old sails hung on the
walls, and meeting nothing to suspect, regained by the hatchway the deck
of the vessel.
NA
NA
NA
The captain obeyed. Dâ€™Artagnan stretched out his arm in which he held
the lantern, put his head in at the half opened door, and seeing that
the cabin was nothing better than a shed:
NA
NA
captain, he regained the state cabin, where his friends were.
Porthos had found nothing, and with him fatigue had prevailed over
hunger. He had fallen asleep and was in a profound slumber when
Dâ€™Artagnan returned. Athos and Aramis were beginning to close their
eyes, which they half opened when their companion came in again.
NA
NA
On this assurance the two friends fell asleep; and Dâ€™Artagnan, who was
very weary, bade good-night to Grimaud and laid himself down in his
cloak, with naked sword at his side, in such a manner that his body
barricaded the passage, and it should be impossible to enter the room
without upsetting him.
71. Port Wine.
In ten minutes the masters slept; not so the servants---hungry, and more
thirsty than hungry.
Blaisois and Mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which
consisted of a plank and a valise. On a hanging table, which swung to
and fro with the rolling of the vessel, were a pot of beer and three
glasses.

majestically to the door of the compartment where the wine was. â€œAh!

yourself by taking partridges in a snare, carp with a line, and bottles

â€œPerfectly true; but there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was
in bottles. I cannot throw the loop through this partition nor move with

NA
NA
Mousqueton opened his great round eyes to the utmost, astonished to find
in Blaisois qualities for which he did not give him credit.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Grimaud, in fact, was not only the accountant, but the armorer of the
party; and as he was a man full of forethought, these trousers,
carefully rolled up in his valise, contained every sort of tool for
immediate use.
Mousqueton, therefore, was soon provided with tools and he began his
task. In a few minutes he had extracted three boards. He tried to pass
his body through the aperture, but not being like the frog in the fable,
who thought he was larger than he really was, he found he must take out
three or four more before he could get through.
He sighed and set to work again.
Grimaud had now finished his accounts. He arose and stood near
Mousqueton.

brilliantly begun by another, he glided like a serpent through the
opening and disappeared.

extraordinary men with whom he had the honor to be associated, this
seemed without question to be the most wonderful.

Mousqueton made, with a low whistling sound, the sign of alarm well
known to the lackeys in the days of their youth, resumed his place at
the table and made a sign to Blaisois to follow his example.
Blaisois obeyed.
The door of their cabin was opened. Two men, wrapped in their cloaks,
appeared.
NA
NA
These two men then went toward the compartment in which Grimaud was
secreted; opened the door, entered and shut it after them.
NA
NA
They waited for ten minutes, during which time no noise was heard that
might indicate that Grimaud was discovered, and at the expiration of
that anxious interval the two men returned, closed the door after them,
and repeating their orders that the servants should go to bed and
extinguish their lights, disappeared.

At that very moment Grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture
and came in with his face livid, his eyes staring wide open with terror,
so that the pupils were contracted almost to nothing, with a large
circle of white around them. He held in his hand a tankard full of a
dark substance, and approaching the gleam of light shed by the lamp he

extreme terror that Mousqueton started, alarmed, and Blaisois was near
fainting from fright.
Both, however, cast an inquisitive glance into the tankard--it was full
of gunpowder.
Convinced that the ship was full of powder instead of having a cargo of
wine, Grimaud hastened to awake Dâ€™Artagnan, who had no sooner beheld him
than he perceived that something extraordinary had taken place. Imposing
silence, Grimaud put out the little night lamp, then knelt down and
poured into the lieutenantâ€™s ear a recital melodramatic enough not to
require play of feature to give it pith.
This was the gist of his strange story:
The first barrel that Grimaud had found on passing into the compartment
he struck--it was empty. He passed on to another--it, also, was empty,
but the third which he tried was, from the dull sound it gave out,
evidently full. At this point Grimaud stopped and was preparing to make
a hole with his gimlet, when he found a spigot; he therefore placed his
tankard under it and turned the spout; something, whatever it was the
cask contained, fell silently into the tankard.
Whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the
tankard contained before taking it to his companions, the door of the
cellar opened and a man with a lantern in his hands and enveloped in a
cloak, came and stood just before the hogshead, behind which Grimaud, on
hearing him come in, instantly crept. This was Groslow. He was
accompanied by another man, who carried in his hand something long and
flexible rolled up, resembling a washing line. His face was hidden under
the wide brim of his hat. Grimaud, thinking that they had come, as he
had, to try the port wine, effaced himself behind his cask and consoled
himself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not
a great one.
NA
NA
At the voice of this last speaker, Grimaud started and felt a shudder
creeping through his very marrow. He rose gently, so that his head was
just above the round of the barrel, and under the large hat he
recognized the pale face of Mordaunt.
NA
NA
That voice also was known to Grimaud. He looked from one to the other
and after Mordaunt he recognized Groslow.
â€œThen tell the men to be in readiness--donâ€™t tell them why now. When the
clock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your men. Get down into

NA
â€œI will undertake that. I wish to be sure of my revenge. Are the oars in
NA
NA
NA
Mordaunt knelt down and fastened one end of the train to the spigot, in
order that he might have nothing to do but to set it on fire at the
opposite end with the match.
He then arose.
NA
NA
there is great danger in what you undertake; would it not be better to
NA
NA
â€˜Nothing one does not do oneâ€™s self is ever well done.â€™ I shall abide by
NA
Grimaud had heard all this, if he had not understood it. But what he saw
made good what he lacked in perfect comprehension of the language. He
had seen the two mortal enemies of the musketeers, had seen Mordaunt
adjust the fuse; he had heard the proverb, which Mordaunt had given in
French. Then he felt and felt again the contents of the tankard he held
in his hand; and, instead of the lively liquor expected by Blaisois and
Mousqueton, he found beneath his fingers the grains of some coarse
powder.
Mordaunt went away with the captain. At the door he stopped to listen.
NA
In fact, Porthos could be heard snoring through the partition.
NA
NA
And they went out together.
72. End of the Port Wine Mystery.
Grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was
satisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from his recumbent posture.
NA
NA
He made haste to pass out by the opening, still thinking himself in a
dream; but the sight of the gunpowder in the tankard proved to him that
his dream was a fatal nightmare.
It may be imagined that Dâ€™Artagnan listened to these details with
increasing interest; before Grimaud had finished he rose without noise
and putting his mouth to Aramisâ€™s ear, and at the same time touching him
on the shoulder to prevent a sudden movement:
NA
Aramis awoke. Dâ€™Artagnan, pressing his hand, repeated his call. Aramis
obeyed.
NA
Aramis easily aroused Athos, whose sleep was light, like that of all
persons of a finely organized constitution. But there was more
difficulty in arousing Porthos. He was beginning to ask full explanation
of that breaking in on his sleep, which was very annoying to him, when
Dâ€™Artagnan, instead of explaining, closed his mouth with his hand.
Then our Gascon, extending his arms, drew to him the heads of his three
friends till they almost touched one another.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The shudder of the three musketeers showed to Dâ€™Artagnan that his words
began to make some impression on them.
NA
NA
â€œGroslow is the man who broke Parryâ€™s head and is now getting ready to

NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, but Monsieur Groslow is not a captain of the ordinary kind; he has

This time the musketeers did more than shudder--they almost cried out.
Those invincible men were subject to a mysterious and fatal influence
which that name had over them; the mere sound of it filled them with
terror.
NA
NA
NA
NA
casks of port wine are filled with powder. When Mordaunt finds himself
discovered he will destroy all, friends and foes; and on my word he

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan went toward a very small, low window, just large enough to
let a man through. He turned it gently on its hinges.
NA
NA
â€œStay here, if you like, but I warn you â€˜twill be rather too warm
NA
NA
â€œThe longboat is yonder, lashed to the felucca. We will take possession
NA
NA
NA
Meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful
sight which Dâ€™Artagnan, in raising the shutters, had disclosed to them
through the narrow opening of the window.
Those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing
more solemn, more striking, than the raging sea, rolling, with its
deafening roar, its dark billows beneath the pale light of a wintry
moon.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
But Dâ€™Artagnan had now slipped through the window.
NA
NA
spirit triumph over body. Do you, Aramis, order the servants. Porthos,
NA
And after pressing the hand of Athos, Dâ€™Artagnan chose a moment when the
ship rolled backward, so that he had only to plunge into the water,
which was already up to his waist.
Athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves; the cable
which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of
the sea.
Dâ€™Artagnan swam to it and held it, suspending himself by this rope, his
head alone out of water.
In one second Athos joined him.
Then they saw, as the felucca turned, two other heads peeping, those of
Aramis and Grimaud.
NA
NA
â€œWhen people can swim at all they can swim anywhere. To the boat! to the
NA
NA
NA
In fact, Porthos did not appear; for a scene, half tragedy and half
comedy, had been performed by him with Mousqueton and Blaisois, who,
frightened by the noise of the sea, by the whistling of the wind, by the
sight of that dark water yawning like a gulf beneath them, shrank back
instead of going forward.
NA
NA
NA
NA
said Mousqueton.
NA
NA
NA
A groan, stifled by the grasp of Porthos, was all the reply of poor
Blaisois, for the giant, taking him neck and heels, plunged him into the
water headforemost, pushing him out of the window as if he had been a
plank.
NA
NA
NA
NA
And without any other complaint, passive and obedient, either from true
devotion to his master or from the example set by Blaisois, Mousqueton
leaped into the sea headforemost. A sublime action, at all events, for
Mousqueton looked upon himself as dead. But Porthos was not a man to
abandon an old servant, and when Mousqueton rose above the water, blind
as a new-born puppy, he found he was supported by the large hand of
Porthos and that he was thus enabled, without having occasion even to
move, to advance toward the cable with the dignity of a very triton.
In a few minutes Porthos had rejoined his companions, who were already
in the boat; but when, after they had all got in, it came to his turn,
there was great danger that in putting his huge leg over the edge of the
boat he would upset the little vessel. Athos was the last to enter.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Athos drew a sharp poniard from his belt and cut the cord. The felucca
went on, the boat continued stationary, rocked only by the swashing
waves.
NA
NA
73. Fatality.
Scarcely had Dâ€™Artagnan uttered these words when a ringing and sudden
noise was heard resounding through the felucca, which had now become dim
in the obscurity of the night.
NA
They then at the same instant perceived a large lantern carried on a
pole appear on the deck, defining the forms of shadows behind it.
Suddenly a terrible cry, a cry of despair, was wafted through space; and
as if the shrieks of anguish had driven away the clouds, the veil which
hid the moon was cleated away and the gray sails and dark shrouds of the
felucca were plainly visible beneath the silvery light.
Shadows ran, as if bewildered, to and fro on the vessel, and mournful
cries accompanied these delirious walkers. In the midst of these screams
they saw Mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in hand.
The agitated figures, apparently wild with terror, consisted of Groslow,
who at the hour fixed by Mordaunt had collected his men and the sailors.
Mordaunt, after having listened at the door of the cabin to hear if the
musketeers were still asleep, had gone down into the cellar, convinced
by their silence that they were all in a deep slumber. Then he had run
to the train, impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge, and full of
confidence, as are those whom God blinds, he had set fire to the wick of
nitre.
All this while Groslow and his men were assembled on deck.
NA
One of the sailors got down the side of the ship, seized the cable, and
drew it; it came without the least resistance.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
rushed to the stern, waving his torch.
â€œOnly that our enemies have escaped; they have cut the cord and gone off
NA
Mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the door.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Mordaunt answered only by a terrible laugh, threw his torch into the sea
and plunged in after it. The instant Groslow put his foot upon the
hatchway steps the ship opened like the crater of a volcano. A burst of
flame rose toward the skies with an explosion like that of a hundred
cannon; the air burned, ignited by flaming embers, then the frightful
lightning disappeared, the brands sank, one after another, into the
abyss, where they were extinguished, and save for a slight vibration in
the air, after a few minutes had elapsed one would have thought that
nothing had happened.
Only--the felucca had disappeared from the surface of the sea and
Groslow and his three sailors were consumed.
The four friends saw all this--not a single detail of this fearful scene
escaped them. At one moment, bathed as they were in a flood of brilliant
light, which illumined the sea for the space of a league, they might
each be seen, each by his own peculiar attitude and manner expressing
the awe which, even in their hearts of bronze, they could not help
experiencing. Soon a torrent of vivid sparks fell around them--then, at
last, the volcano was extinguished--then all was dark and still--the
floating bark and heaving ocean.
They sat silent and dejected.
NA
NA
NA
reaching the four friends, seemed to proceed from some phantom of the
ocean.
All looked around; Athos himself stared.
NA
All still remained silent, the eyes of all were turned in the direction
where the vessel had disappeared, endeavoring in vain to penetrate the
darkness. After a minute or two they were able to distinguish a man, who
approached them, swimming vigorously.
Athos extended his arm toward him, pointing him out to his companions.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Aramis and Dâ€™Artagnan whispered to each other.
Mordaunt made several strokes more, and raising his arm in sign of
distress above the waves: â€œPity, pity on me, gentlemen, in Heavenâ€™s

The voice that implored aid was so piteous that it awakened pity in the
heart of Athos.

further.
â€œOh! you will not abandon me! You will not leave me to perish! You will

NA
and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of
NA
NA
NA
the young man, whose agony-drawn breath at times, when his head went
under water, under the wave, exhaled and made the icy waters bubble.
Dâ€™Artagnan, however, who had consulted with Aramis, spoke to the poor
NA
confidence. See! the vessel in which you wished to fry us is still
smoking; and the situation in which you are is a bed of roses compared
to that in which you wished to place us and in which you have placed

NA

drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my mother. You would

Mordaunt wanted now only two or three fathoms to reach the boat, for the
approach of death seemed to give him supernatural strength.
NA
you killed the mother! Surely, if I am culpable and if I ask for pardon,
NA
Then, as if his strength failed him, he seemed unable to sustain himself
above the water and a wave passed over his head, which drowned his
voice.
NA
Mordaunt reappeared.
NA
murderer, as you were, of your uncle! executioner, as you were, of King
Charles! incendiary! I recommend you to sink forthwith to the bottom of
the sea; and if you come another fathom nearer, Iâ€™ll stave your wicked
NA
NA

NA
feet and hands bound, to that wretch? Ah! Comte de la Fere, you wish to

â€˜Twas the first time Dâ€™Artagnan had ever refused a request from Athos.
Aramis calmly drew his sword, which he had carried between his teeth as
he swam.
â€œIf he lays his hand on the boatâ€™s edge I will cut it off, regicide that
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
depicted on his face! Ah! do not bring on me the horrors of remorse!
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan began to be touched. The boat at this moment turned around,
and the dying man was by that turn brought nearer Athos.
NA
call on you--where are you? I see you no longer--I am dying--help me!
NA
NA
Mordaunt with that air of dignity and nobility of soul habitual to him;
NA
Mordaunt made a last effort--rose--seized the hand thus extended to him
and grasped it with the vehemence of despair.
NA
him his shoulder as another stay and support, so that his head almost
touched that of Mordaunt; and these two mortal enemies were in as close
an embrace as if they had been brothers.
NA
NA
impossible to paint, â€œI can only offer thee one victim, but it shall at
NA
And whilst Dâ€™Artagnan uttered a cry, Porthos raised the oar, and Aramis
sought a place to strike, a frightful shake given to the boat
precipitated Athos into the sea; whilst Mordaunt, with a shout of
triumph, grasped the neck of his victim, and in order to paralyze his
movements, twined arms and legs around the musketeer. For an instant,
without an exclamation, without a cry for help, Athos tried to sustain
himself on the surface of the waters, but the weight dragged him down;
he disappeared by degrees; soon nothing was to be seen except his long,
floating hair; then both men disappeared and the bubbling of the water,
which, in its turn, was soon effaced, alone indicated the spot where
these two had sunk.
Mute with horror, the three friends had remained open-mouthed, their
eyes dilated, their arms extended like statues, and, motionless as they
were, the beating of their hearts was audible. Porthos was the first who
came to himself. He tore his hair.
NA
NA
At this instant, in the midst of the silver circle illumined by the
light of the moon the same whirlpool which had been made by the sinking
men was again obvious, and first were seen, rising above the waves, a
wisp of hair, then a pale face with open eyes, yet, nevertheless, the
eyes of death; then a body, which, after rising of itself even to the
waist above the sea, turned gently on its back, according to the caprice
of the waves, and floated.
In the bosom of this corpse was plunged a poniard, the gold hilt of
which shone in the moonbeams.
NA
NA
Suddenly the boat leaned on one side beneath a new and unexpected weight
and Grimaud uttered a shout of joy; every one turned around and beheld
Athos, livid, his eyes dim and his hands trembling, supporting himself
on the edge of the boat. Eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately
and laid him in the boat, where directly Athos was warmed and
reanimated, reviving with the caresses and cares of his friends, who
were intoxicated with joy.
NA
NA
NA
and Dâ€™Artagnan, obliging Athos to look in the direction he pointed,
showed him the body of Mordaunt floating on its back, which, sometimes
submerged, sometimes rising, seemed still to pursue the four friends
with looks of insult and mortal hatred.
At last he sank. Athos had followed him with a glance in which the
deepest melancholy and pity were expressed.
NA
NA
NA

NA
NA
74. How Mousqueton had a Narrow Escape of being eaten.
A deep silence reigned for a long time in the boat after the fearful
scene described.
The moon, which had shone for a short time, disappeared behind the
clouds; every object was again plunged in the obscurity that is so awful
in the deserts and still more so in that liquid desert, the ocean, and
nothing was heard save the whistling of the west wind driving along the
tops of the crested billows.
Porthos was the first to speak.
NA
agitated me so much as what I have just witnessed. Nevertheless, even in
my present state of perturbation, I protest that I feel happy. I have a
NA
fact, Porthos breathed so loud as to do credit to the free play of his
powerful lungs.
NA
Porthos. I am still terrified to such a degree that I scarcely believe
my eyes. I look around the boat, expecting every moment to see that poor
NA
NA
sixth rib and buried up to the hilt in his body. I do not reproach you,
Athos, for what you have done. On the contrary, when one aims a blow
that is the regulation way to strike. So now, I breathe again--I am
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan; â€œnever have we incurred a greater danger than we are now
encountering. Men may subdue men--they cannot overcome the elements. We
are now on the sea, at night, without any pilot, in a frail bark; should

Mousqueton heaved a deep sigh.
NA

us sail before the wind, and unless it changes we shall be drifted
either to Calais or Boulogne. Should our bark be upset we are five of us
good swimmers, able enough to turn it over again, or if not, to hold on
by it. Now we are on the very road which all the vessels between Dover
and Calais take, â€˜tis impossible but that we should meet with a

â€œBut should we not find any fisherman and should the wind shift to the

Mousqueton sighed again, more deeply than before.

NA
â€œImpossible! your body is covered with a coating of fat which preserves

â€œHow is that, Mousqueton?
â€œAlas! your honor, in the library of the Chateau of Bracieux there are a

NA
NA
One may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended
chiefly to divert Athos from the scene which had just taken place, the
servants, with the exception of Grimaud, were not silent. Suddenly
Mousqueton uttered a cry of delight, taking from beneath one of the
benches a bottle of wine; and on looking more closely in the same place
he discovered a dozen similar bottles, bread, and a monster junk of
salted beef.
NA
NA
This intelligence restored every one save Athos to gayety.
NA
NA
And he drank off half a bottle at a draught and bit great mouthfuls of
the bread and meat.
NA
NA
In a few moments, notwithstanding their wet clothes, the icy blast that
blew and the previous scene of terror, these hardy adventurers, with
their iron frames, inured to every hardship, threw themselves down,
intending to profit by the advice of Athos, who sat at the helm,
pensively wakeful, guiding the little bark the way it was to go, his
eyes fixed on the heavens, as if he sought to verify not only the road
to France, but the benign aspect of protecting Providence. After some
hours of repose the sleepers were aroused by Athos.
Dawn was shedding its pallid, placid glimmer on the purple ocean, when
at the distance of a musket shot from them was seen a dark gray mass,
above which gleamed a triangular sail; then masters and servants joined
in a fervent cry to the crew of that vessel to hear them and to save.
NA
It was, in fact, a small craft from Dunkirk bound for Boulogne.
A quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all
aboard. Grimaud tendered twenty guineas to the captain, and at nine
oâ€™clock in the morning, having a fair wind, our Frenchmen set foot on
their native land.

The party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks
of sand unobserved. Here, after a short conference, they proposed to
separate.

be much better that the other two should be spared to assist those who
may be apprehended? Besides, who knows whether, divided, we may not
obtain a pardon--you from the queen, we from Mazarin--which, were we all
four together, would never be granted. Come, Athos and Aramis, go to the
right; Porthos, come with me to the left; these gentlemen should file

Then they embraced. At that moment their fraternal bond of union was
closer than ever, and when they parted, each to take the route agreed
on, they turned back to utter affectionate expressions, which the echoes
of the Dunes repeated. At last they lost sight of each other.
NA
I canâ€™t keep to myself anything I have against you; I havenâ€™t been able

NA
NA
NA
The two immediately started across country toward the road to Paris,
followed by Mousqueton, who, after being too cold all night, at the end
of a quarter of an hour found himself too warm.
75. The Return.
During the six weeks that Athos and Aramis had been absent from France,
the Parisians, finding themselves one morning without either queen or
king, were greatly annoyed at being thus deserted, and the absence of
Mazarin, a thing so long desired, did not compensate for that of the two
august fugitives.
The first feeling that pervaded Paris on hearing of the flight to Saint
Germain, was that sort of affright which seizes children when they awake
in the night and find themselves alone. A deputation was therefore sent
to the queen to entreat her to return to Paris; but she not only
declined to receive the deputies, but sent an intimation by Chancellor
Seguier, implying that if the parliament did not humble itself before
her majesty by negativing all the questions that had been the cause of
the quarrel, Paris would be besieged the very next day.
This threatening answer, unluckily for the court, produced quite a
different effect to that which was intended. It wounded the pride of the
parliament, which, supported by the citizens, replied by declaring that
Cardinal Mazarin was the cause of all the discontent; denounced him as
the enemy both of the king and the state, and ordered him to retire from
the court that same day and from France within a week afterward;
enjoining, in case of disobedience on his part, all the subjects of the
king to pursue and take him.
Mazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the law,
preparations on both sides were commenced--by the queen, to attack
Paris, by the citizens, to defend it. The latter were occupied in
breaking up the pavement and stretching chains across the streets, when,
headed by the coadjutor, appeared the Prince de Conti (the brother of
the Prince de Conde) and the Duc de Longueville, his brother-in-law.
This unexpected band of auxiliaries arrived in Paris on the tenth of
January and the Prince of Conti was named, but not until after a stormy
discussion, generalissimo of the army of the king, out of Paris.
As for the Duc de Beaufort, he arrived from Vendome, according to the
annals of the day, bringing with him his high bearing and his long and
beautiful hair, qualifications which gained him the sovereignty of the
marketplaces.
The Parisian army had organized with the promptness characteristic of
the bourgeois whenever they are moved by any sentiment whatever to
disguise themselves as soldiers. On the nineteenth the impromptu army
had attempted a sortie, more to assure itself and others of its actual
existence than with any more serious intention. They carried a banner,
NA
The next following days were occupied in trivial movements which
resulted only in the carrying off of a few herds of cattle and the
burning of two or three houses.
That was still the situation of affairs up to the early days of
February. On the first day of that month our four companions had landed
at Boulogne, and, in two parties, had set out for Paris. Toward the end
of the fourth day of the journey Athos and Aramis reached Nanterre,
which place they cautiously passed by on the outskirts, fearing that
they might encounter some troop from the queenâ€™s army.
It was against his will that Athos took these precautions, but Aramis
had very judiciously reminded him that they had no right to be
imprudent, that they had been charged by King Charles with a supreme and
sacred mission, which, received at the foot of the scaffold, could be
accomplished only at the feet of Queen Henrietta. Upon that, Athos
yielded.
On reaching the capital Athos and Aramis found it in arms. The sentinel
at the gate refused even to let them pass, and called his sergeant.
The sergeant, with the air of importance which such people assume when
they are clad with military dignity, said:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAh, every one seems to be going to see the queen of England. We have
already at the station three gentlemen whose passports are under
examination, who are on their way to her majesty. Where are your

â€œWe have none; we left England, ignorant of the state of politics here,
NA
NA
NA
NA
Mazarinists we should come well prepared with every sort of passport. In

NA
NA
The guardroom was filled with citizens and common people, some playing,
some drinking, some talking. In a corner, almost hidden from view, were
three gentlemen, who had preceded Athos and Aramis, and an officer was
examining their passports. The first impulse of these three, and of
those who last entered, was to cast an inquiring glance at each other.
The first arrivals wore long cloaks, in whose drapery they were
carefully enveloped; one of them, shorter than the rest, remained
pertinaciously in the background.
When the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability
he was bringing in two Mazarinists, it appeared to be the unanimous
opinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to pass.
NA

seems to be only one thing to do, which is, to send our names to Her
Majesty the Queen of England, and if she engages to answer for us I

On hearing these words the shortest of the other three men seemed more
attentive than ever to what was going on, wrapping his cloak around him
more carefully than before.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
At this instant the sergeant, who had been for his orders, returned, and
pointing to the three gentlemen in cloaks, said:
NA
The three gentlemen bowed and hastened to take advantage of this
permission.
Aramis looked after them, and as the last of them passed close to him he
pressed the hand of Athos.
NA
NA
NA
â€œOnly by their passports; they are three Frondists, who are gone to

NA

The sergeant burst into a fit of laughter.

NA

NA

at that moment upon the threshold of the room.

76. The Ambassadors.
The two friends rode rapidly down the declivity of the Faubourg, but on
arriving at the bottom were surprised to find that the streets of Paris
had become rivers, and the open places lakes; after the great rains
which fell in January the Seine had overflowed its banks and the river
inundated half the capital. The two gentlemen were obliged, therefore,
to get off their horses and take a boat; and in that strange manner they
approached the Louvre.
Night had closed in, and Paris, seen thus, by the light of lanterns
flickering on the pools of water, crowded with ferry-boats of every
kind, including those that glittered with the armed patrols, with the
watchword, passing from post to post--Paris presented such an aspect as
to strongly seize the senses of Aramis, a man most susceptible to
warlike impressions.
They reached the queenâ€™s apartments, but were compelled to stop in the
ante-chamber, since her majesty was at that moment giving audience to
gentlemen bringing her news from England.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
which the queen had so often pronounced with hope, â€œin that case it is
another thing, and I think her majesty will pardon me for not keeping
NA
Athos and Aramis.
On arriving at the door of the room where the queen was receiving he
made a sign for them to wait and opening the door:
NA
your orders, when you learn that the gentlemen I have come to announce

On hearing those two names the queen uttered a cry of joy, which the two
gentlemen heard.
NA
NA
bounding to the door.
The poor child was constant in her attendance on her mother and sought
by her filial attentions to make her forget the absence of her two sons
and her other daughter.
NA
The queen was seated on a fauteuil and before her were standing two or
three gentlemen, and among them the Duc de Chatillon, the brother of the
nobleman killed eight or nine years previously in a duel on account of
Madame de Longueville, on the Place Royale. All these gentlemen had been
noticed by Athos and Aramis in the guardhouse, and when the two friends
were announced they started and exchanged some words in a low tone.
NA
come, faithful friends! But the royal couriers have been more
expeditious than you, and here are Monsieur de Flamarens and Monsieur de
Chatillon, who bring me from Her Majesty the Queen Anne of Austria, the
NA
Aramis and Athos were astounded by the calmness, even the gayety of the
queenâ€™s manner.
NA
Chatillon. â€œYou said that His Majesty, King Charles, my august consort,
NA
NA
Athos and Aramis were more and more astonished.
NA
lord! oh, my king!--and that being led to the scaffold he had been saved
NA
NA
two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this
affirmation.
The queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude, whilst her
daughter threw her arms around her motherâ€™s neck and kissed her--her own
eyes streaming with tears.
â€œNow, madame, nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful
NA
gaze of Athos.
NA
the Chevalier dâ€™Herblay and the Comte de la Fere, just arrived from
London, and they can give you, as eye-witnesses, such details as you can
convey to the queen, my royal sister. Speak, gentlemen, speak--I am
listening; conceal nothing, gloss over nothing. Since his majesty still
lives, since the honor of the throne is safe, everything else is a

Athos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart.

these gentlemen until they perceive themselves that they have perhaps

the presumption to set it to rights--that would be to accuse Her

announce some terrible tidings--your hands tremble. Oh, my God! my God!

During this brief altercation Athos, with his hands on his heart, his
head bent low, approached the queen and in a voice of deepest sorrow
said:
â€œMadame, princes--who by nature are above other men--receive from Heaven
courage to support greater misfortunes than those of lower rank, for
their hearts are elevated as their fortunes. We ought not, therefore, I
think, to act toward a queen so illustrious as your majesty as we should
act toward a woman of our lowlier condition. Queen, destined as you are
to endure every sorrow on this earth, hear the result of our unhappy
NA
Athos, kneeling down before the queen, trembling and very cold, drew
from his bosom, inclosed in the same case, the order set in diamonds
which the queen had given to Lord de Winter and the wedding ring which
Charles I. before his death had placed in the hands of Aramis. Since the
moment he had first received these two mementoes Athos had never parted
with them.
He opened the case and offered them to the queen with deep and silent
anguish.
The queen stretched out her hand, seized the ring, pressed it
convulsively to her lips--and without being able to breathe a sigh, to
give vent to a sob, she extended her arms, became deadly pale, and fell
senseless in the arms of her attendants and her daughter.
Athos kissed the hem of the robe of the widowed queen and rising, with a
dignity that made a deep impression on those around:
â€œI, the Comte de la Fere, a gentleman who has never deceived any human
being, swear before God and before this unhappy queen, that all that was
possible to save the king of England was done whilst we were on English
NA
NA
NA
NA
And turning to Chatillon: â€œSir, be so good as not to go away without
giving me an opportunity to tell you something I cannot say before the

Chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out, stopping at
the window of a gallery on the ground floor.

Chatillon and Flamarens looked at each other. There was such irony in
the words and in the bearing of Aramis that the duke had great
difficulty in bridling his anger, but at a word from Flamarens he
restrained himself and contented himself with saying:

NA
NA
NA
Athos curled his lip with disdain.

NA
NA
â€œReally, Athos, you would make a singular general. You would fight only
by broad daylight, warn your foe before an attack, and never attempt
anything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the

It was then agreed that they were to go first to Monsieur de Bouillon,
as his house came first; but first of all Athos begged that he might go
to the Hotel du Grand Charlemagne, to see Raoul.
They re-entered the boat which had brought them to the Louvre and thence
proceeded to the Halles; and taking up Grimaud and Blaisois, they went
on foot to the Rue Guenegaud.
But Raoul was not at the Hotel du Grand Charlemagne. He had received a
message from the prince, to whom he had hastened with Olivain the
instant he had received it.
77. The three Lieutenants of the Generalissimo.
The night was dark, but still the town resounded with those noises that
disclose a city in a state of siege. Athos and Aramis did not proceed a
hundred steps without being stopped by sentinels placed before the
barricades, who demanded the watchword; and on their saying that they
were going to Monsieur de Bouillon on a mission of importance a guide
was given them under pretext of conducting them, but in fact as a spy
over their movements.
On arriving at the Hotel de Bouillon they came across a little troop of
three cavaliers, who seemed to know every possible password; for they
walked without either guide or escort, and on arriving at the barricades
had nothing to do but to speak to those who guarded them, who instantly
let them pass with evident deference, due probably to their high birth.
On seeing them Athos and Aramis stood still.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Athos smiled, but did not reply. Five minutes afterward they knocked at
the princeâ€™s door.
This door was guarded by a sentinel and there was also a guard placed in
the courtyard, ready to obey the orders of the Prince de Contiâ€™s
lieutenant.
Monsieur de Bouillon had the gout, but notwithstanding his illness,
which had prevented his mounting on horseback for the last month---that
is, since Paris had been besieged--he was ready to receive the Comte de
la Fere and the Chevalier dâ€™Herblay.
He was in bed, but surrounded with all the paraphernalia of war.
Everywhere were swords, pistols, cuirasses, and arquebuses, and it was
plain that as soon as his gout was better Monsieur de Bouillon would
give a pretty tangle to the enemies of the parliament to unravel.
Meanwhile, to his great regret, as he said, he was obliged to keep his
bed.
NA

people. But I, as you see, am nailed to my bed--ah! this demon,

head of my house the title of prince, and if my brother De Turenne were
reinstated in his command I would return to my estates and leave the

NA
â€œFaith! yes. I am even sorry that this evening I almost repulsed--but

The two friends saluted the duke.
NA
Poor King Charles! But, after all, he was somewhat to blame in all that
business and we may console ourselves with the reflection that France
has no cause of reproach in the matter and did all she could to serve

Athos and Aramis took their leave, but even in the ante-chamber they
could still hear the dukeâ€™s cries; he was evidently suffering the
tortures of the damned.
When they reached the street, Aramis said:

NA
â€œYou noticed that I didnâ€™t breathe a word as to the purpose of our

â€œYou did well; you would have caused him an access of his disease. Let

The two friends went to the Hotel de Vendome. It was ten oâ€™clock when
they arrived. The Hotel de Vendome was not less guarded than the Hotel
de Bouillon, and presented as warlike an appearance. There were
sentinels, a guard in the court, stacks of arms, and horses saddled. Two
horsemen going out as Athos and Aramis entered were obliged to give
place to them.

NA
NA
De Flamarens and De Chatillon continued on their way and Athos and
Aramis dismounted.
Hardly had they given the bridles of their horses to their lackeys and
rid themselves of their cloaks when a man approached them, and after
looking at them for an instant by the doubtful light of the lantern hung
in the centre of the courtyard he uttered an exclamation of joy and ran
to embrace them.
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes! we arrived four or five days ago from the Vendomois, as you know,
and we are going to give Mazarin something to do. You are still with us,

quickly on hearing the two friends announced.

was promised me at his death, well! it would not be long before I should

At this Athos and Aramis could not help exchanging not only a look but a

that De Chatillon and De Flamarens had been there.

â€œAh, yes. You understand, then, Comte de la Fere, you understand,

Athos and Aramis bowed and went out.

NA
They directed their horses to the city. On arriving at the cradle from
which Paris sprang they found it inundated with water, and it was again
necessary to take a boat. The palace rose from the bosom of the water,
and to see the number of boats around it one would have fancied oneâ€™s
self not in Paris, but in Venice. Some of these boats were dark and
mysterious, others noisy and lighted up with torches. The friends slid
in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their turn. The
palace was surrounded with water, but a kind of staircase had been fixed
to the lower walls; and the only difference was, that instead of
entering by the doors, people entered by the windows.
Thus did Athos and Aramis make their appearance in the ante-chamber,
where about a dozen noblemen were collected in waiting.

Bazin, who was crossing the ante-chamber majestically in his clerical
dress, turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus
addressed him; but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and
expressed delight at seeing them.
NA
NA
â€œCertainly, sir--it is not such lords as you are who are allowed to wait
in the ante-chamber, only just now he has a secret conference with

NA

And they hastened to quit the palace, followed by Bazin, who was lavish
of bows and compliments.
NA
beginning to be convinced that we should have done a bad turn to all
NA
NA
What had especially been observed by the two friends was the little
interest taken by the court of France in the terrible events which had
occurred in England, which they thought should have arrested the
attention of all Europe.
In fact, aside from a poor widow and a royal orphan who wept in the
corner of the Louvre, no one appeared to be aware that Charles I. had
ever lived and that he had perished on the scaffold.
The two friends made an appointment for ten oâ€™clock on the following
day; for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door
of the hotel, Aramis said that he had certain important visits to make
and left Athos to enter alone.
At ten oâ€™clock the next day they met again. Athos had been out since six
oâ€™clock.

â€œNothing. No one has seen Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos has not appeared. Have

â€œIn that case, my dear friend, if you are resolved to accompany me there

â€œNo doubt; but they will fight, none the less, if only to mask the

NA
â€œWell, let us go, then, where the fighting is, for that is the most
likely place to meet with Dâ€™Artagnan, Porthos, and possibly even Raoul.

Planchet, prouder than ever of his new duties, deigned to explain to the
two gentlemen that he was ordered to take up his position on the Place
Royale with two hundred men, forming the rear of the army of Paris, and
to march on Charenton when necessary.
NA
NA
NA
Aramis saluted, then turning toward Athos:
NA
NA
â€œAnd then Monsieur de Chatillon will not come to the Place Royale to

78. The Battle of Charenton.
As Athos and Aramis proceeded, and passed different companies on the
road, they became aware that they were arriving near the field of
battle.
NA
fancy I perceive around us faces of different officers in the royal
army; is not that the Duc de Chatillon himself coming toward us with his

NA
see here, but one word will explain everything. There is now a truce and
a conference. The prince, Monsieur de Retz, the Duc de Beaufort, the Duc
de Bouillon, are talking over public affairs. Now one of two things must
happen: either matters will not be arranged, or they will be arranged,
in which last case I shall be relieved of my command and we shall still

NA
NA
â€œAt Charenton, in the second house on the right on entering from the
NA
NA
â€œNo, gentlemen, it seems to be the result of certain propositions which

Athos and Aramis exchanged smiles; for they well knew what those
propositions were, to whom they had been made and who had made them.
NA
NA
â€œTo Monsieur de Chanleu, who commands your troops at Charenton. I say
NA
NA
NA
NA
his generals are the Duke of Orleans and the Prince de Conde, although I
must add â€˜tis almost impossible now to know to which party any one
NA
NA
Prince de Conti, De Beaufort, Dâ€™Elbeuf, and De Bouillon; but, sir,
supposing that the conference is broken off--are you going to try to

NA
NA

â€œSo much the better. You must know all your officers--I mean those more

The two friends looked at each other.
NA
NA
â€œIt is absolutely certain that some misfortune has happened to them on
NA
NA
Athos nodded affirmatively, then turning:
â€œAnd Monsieur de Bragelonne, a young man fifteen years of age, attached
NA
diffident in allowing the sarcastic Aramis to perceive how strong were
his paternal feelings.
â€œYes, surely, he came with the prince; a charming young man; he is one

NA
NA
â€œQuite possible, sir; do me the favor to accompany me and I will conduct

NA
NA

NA
â€œThey are coming, full gallop; the prince is with them--ah! he is
NA
NA
NA
In fact, they saw the soldiers running to their arms; the trumpets
sounded; the drums beat; the Duc de Beaufort drew his sword. On his side
the prince sounded a rappel and all the officers of the royalist army,
mingling momentarily with the Parisian troops, ran to him.
NA
they are going to fight; go, then, into Charenton, for I shall begin in
NA
The cornet of a troop had in fact just raised the standard of the
prince.
NA
full gallop.
Athos and Aramis turned also and went to salute the coadjutor and the
Duc de Beaufort. As to the Duc de Bouillon, he had such a fit of gout as
obliged him to return to Paris in a litter; but his place was well
filled by the Duc dâ€™Elbeuf and his four sons, ranged around him like a
staff. Meantime, between Charenton and the royal army was left a space
which looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the dead.
NA
after the fashion of the ancient military prelates, over his
archiepiscopal simar, â€œthereâ€™s the enemy approaching. Let us save them
NA
And without caring whether he were followed or not he set off; his
regiment, which bore the name of the regiment of Corinth, from the name
of his archbishopric, darted after him and began the fight. Monsieur de
Beaufort sent his cavalry, toward Etampes and Monsieur de Chanleu, who
defended the place, was ready to resist an assault, or if the enemy were
repulsed, to attempt a sortie.
The battle soon became general and the coadjutor performed miracles of
valor. His proper vocation had always been the sword and he was
delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard, no matter for
whom or against whom.
Chanleu, whose fire at one time repulsed the royal regiment, thought
that the moment was come to pursue it; but it was reformed and led again
to the charge by the Duc de Chatillon in person. This charge was so
fierce, so skillfully conducted, that Chanleu was almost surrounded. He
commanded a retreat, which began, step by step, foot by foot; unhappily,
in an instant he fell, mortally wounded. De Chatillon saw him fall and
announced it in a loud voice to his men, which raised their spirits and
completely disheartened their enemies, so that every man thought only of
his own safety and tried to gain the trenches, where the coadjutor was
trying to reform his disorganized regiment.
Suddenly a squadron of cavalry galloped up to encounter the royal
troops, who were entering, pele-mele, the intrenchments with the
fugitives. Athos and Aramis charged at the head of their squadrons;
Aramis with sword and pistol in his hands, Athos with his sword in his
scabbard, his pistol in his saddle-bags; calm and cool as if on the
parade, except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he
saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the
obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the
princes. Aramis, on the contrary, struck right and left and was almost
delirious with excitement. His bright eyes kindled, and his mouth, so
finely formed, assumed a wicked smile; every blow he aimed was sure, and
his pistol finished the deed--annihilated the wounded wretch who tried
to rise again.
On the opposite side two cavaliers, one covered with a gilt cuirass, the
other wearing simply a buff doublet, from which fell the sleeves of a
vest of blue velvet, charged in front. The cavalier in the gilt cuirass
fell upon Aramis and struck a blow that Aramis parried with his wonted
skill.

Aramis awaited him with that terrible smile which was peculiar to him on
such occasions, and Athos, who saw the duke advancing toward Aramis with
the rapidity of lightning, was just going to cry out, â€œFire! fire,

The ball had entered his breast through a notch in the cuirass.

Chatillon made a sign with his hand and Aramis was about to dismount
when he received a violent shock; â€˜twas a thrust from a sword, but his
cuirass turned aside the blow.
He turned around and seized his new antagonist by the wrist, when he

The young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father
and the Chevalier dâ€™Herblay; two officers in the Parisian forces rushed
at that instant on Raoul, but Aramis protected him with his sword.

Athos took his sonâ€™s horse by the bridle and led him forth out of the
melee.
At this crisis of the battle, the prince, who had been seconding De
Chatillon in the second line, appeared in the midst of the fight; his
eagle eye made him known and his blows proclaimed the hero.
On seeing him, the regiment of Corinth, which the coadjutor had not been
able to reorganize in spite of all his efforts, threw itself into the
midst of the Parisian forces, put them into confusion and re-entered
Charenton flying. The coadjutor, dragged along with his fugitive forces,
passed near the group formed by Athos, Raoul and Aramis. Aramis could
not in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutorâ€™s misfortune,
and was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct, when Athos
stopped him.

Raoul gave it up reluctantly; Aramis instantly seized and read it.

Athos took the letter, frowning, but an idea that he should find
something in this letter about Dâ€™Artagnan conquered his unwillingness to
read it.

â€œThat poor Planchet! You speak of him very much at your ease, Aramis; he

NA
It was, then, with a sentiment of uneasiness whether Planchet, who alone
could give them information, was alive or dead, that the friends
returned to the Place Royale; to their great surprise they found the
citizens still encamped there, drinking and bantering each other,
although, doubtless, mourned by their families, who thought they were at
Charenton in the thickest of the fighting.
Athos and Aramis again questioned Planchet, but he had seen nothing of
Dâ€™Artagnan; they wished to take Planchet with them, but he could not
leave his troop, who at five oâ€™clock returned home, saying that they
were returning from the battle, whereas they had never lost sight of the
bronze equestrian statue of Louis XIII.
79. The Road to Picardy.
On leaving Paris, Athos and Aramis well knew that they would be
encountering great danger; but we know that for men like these there
could be no question of danger. Besides, they felt that the denouement
of this second Odyssey was at hand and that there remained but a single
effort to make.
Besides, there was no tranquillity in Paris itself. Provisions began to
fail, and whenever one of the Prince de Contiâ€™s generals wished to gain
more influence he got up a little popular tumult, which he put down
again, and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his colleagues.
In one of these risings, the Duc de Beaufort pillaged the house and
library of Mazarin, in order to give the populace, as he put it,
something to gnaw at. Athos and Aramis left Paris after this
coup-dâ€™etat, which took place on the very evening of the day in which
the Parisians had been beaten at Charenton.
They quitted Paris, beholding it abandoned to extreme want, bordering on
famine; agitated by fear, torn by faction. Parisians and Frondeurs as
they were, the two friends expected to find the same misery, the same
fears, the same intrigue in the enemyâ€™s camp; but what was their
surprise, after passing Saint Denis, to hear that at Saint Germain
people were singing and laughing, and leading generally cheerful lives.
The two gentlemen traveled by byways in order not to encounter the
Mazarinists scattered about the Isle of France, and also to escape the
Frondeurs, who were in possession of Normandy and who never failed to
conduct captives to the Duc de Longueville, in order that he might
ascertain whether they were friends or foes. Having escaped these
dangers, they returned by the main road to Boulogne, at Abbeville, and
followed it step by step, examining every track.
Nevertheless, they were still in a state of uncertainty. Several inns
were visited by them, several innkeepers questioned, without a single
clew being given to guide their inquiries, when at Montreuil Athos felt
upon the table that something rough was touching his delicate fingers.
He turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the
wood with a knife:
NA
NA
NA
Abbeville. There the great number of inns puzzled them; they could not
go to all; how could they guess in which those whom they were seeking
had stayed?
NA
If we had only been looking for Porthos, Porthos would have stationed
himself in one of the finest hotels and we could easily have traced him.
But Dâ€™Artagnan is devoid of such weaknesses. Porthos would have found it
very difficult even to make him see that he was dying of hunger; he has
gone on his road as inexorable as fate and we must seek him somewhere
NA
They continued their route. It had now become a weary and almost
hopeless task, and had it not been for the threefold motives of honor,
friendship and gratitude, implanted in their hearts, our two travelers
would have given up many a time their rides over the sand, their
interrogatories of the peasantry and their close inspection of faces.
They proceeded thus to Peronne.
Athos began to despair. His noble nature felt that their ignorance was a
sort of reflection upon them. They had not looked carefully enough for
their lost friends. They had not shown sufficient pertinacity in their
inquiries. They were willing and ready to retrace their steps, when, in
crossing the suburb which leads to the gates of the town, upon a white
wall which was at the corner of a street turning around the rampart,
Athos cast his eyes upon a drawing in black chalk, which represented,
with the awkwardness of a first attempt, two cavaliers riding furiously;
one of them carried a roll of paper on which were written these words:
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed
very closely, which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in
NA
Aramis shook his head.
â€œHad he escaped we should either have seen him or have heard him spoken
NA
NA
To describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be
impossible. Uneasiness took possession of the tender, constant heart of
Athos, and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive Aramis.
They galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on
the wall. All at once, in a narrow pass, they perceived that the road
was partially barricaded by an enormous stone. It had evidently been
rolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength.
Aramis stopped.
NA
NA
They both alighted. The stone had been brought with the evident
intention of barricading the road, but some one having perceived the
obstacle had partially turned it aside.
With the assistance of Blaisois and Grimaud the friends succeeded in
turning the stone over. Upon the side next the ground were scratched the
following words:
â€œEight of the light dragoons are pursuing us. If we reach Compiegne we
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Aramis was right; they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse
swallow a double quantity of corn steeped in wine; they gave them three
hoursâ€™ rest and then set off again. The men themselves were almost dead
with fatigue, but hope supported them.
In six hours they reached Compiegne and alighted at the Peacock. The
host proved to be a worthy man, as bald as a Chinaman. They asked him if
some time ago he had not received in his house two gentlemen who were
pursued by dragoons; without answering he went out and brought in the
blade of a rapier.

Athos merely glanced at it.

The two friends having agreed to leave Blaisois and Grimaud at Compiegne
with the horses, resolved to take post horses; and having snatched a
hasty dinner they continued their journey to Louvres. Here they found
only one inn, in which was consumed a liqueur which preserves its
reputation to our time and which is still made in that town.

They went into the town and asked for two glasses of liqueur, at the
counter--as their friends must have done before them. The counter was
covered with a plate of pewter; upon this plate was written with the
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œHad I been as great a friend of Jonah as I am of Dâ€™Artagnan I should
have followed him even into the inside of the whale itself; and you
NA
â€œCertainly--but you make me out better than I am, dear count. Had I been
alone I should scarcely have gone to Rueil without great caution. But
NA
They then set off for Rueil. Here the deputies of the parliament had
just arrived, in order to enter upon those famous conferences which were
to last three weeks, and produced eventually that shameful peace, at the
conclusion of which the prince was arrested. Rueil was crowded with
advocates, presidents and councillors, who came from the Parisians, and,
on the side of the court, with officers and guards; it was therefore
easy, in the midst of this confusion, to remain as unobserved as any one
might wish; besides, the conferences implied a truce, and to arrest two
gentlemen, even Frondeurs, at this time, would have been an attack on
the rights of the people.
The two friends mingled with the crowd and fancied that every one was
occupied with the same thought that tormented them. They expected to
hear some mention made of Dâ€™Artagnan or of Porthos, but every one was
engrossed by articles and reforms. It was the advice of Athos to go
straight to the minister.
NA
If we were to make ourselves known we should be sent to rejoin our
friends in some deep ditch, from which the devil himself could not take
us out. Let us try not to find them out by accident, but from our
notions. Arrested at Compiegne, they have been carried to Rueil; at
Rueil they have been questioned by the cardinal, who has either kept
them near him or sent them to Saint Germain. As to the Bastile, they are
not there, though the Bastile is especially for the Frondeurs. They are
not dead, for the death of Dâ€™Artagnan would make a sensation. As for
Porthos, I believe him to be eternal, like God, although less patient.
Do not let us despond, but wait at Rueil, for my conviction is that they

NA
â€œI remember that at the Castle of Rueil the Cardinal Richelieu had some

greatest of us on the head, and touching them make such heads shake on
their shoulders. But Mazarin is a low-born rogue, who can at the most
take us by the collar, like an archer. Be calm--for I am sure that

They continued their inquiries and at last met with a light dragoon who
had formed one of the guard which had escorted Dâ€™Artagnan to Rueil.
Athos, however, perpetually recurred to his proposed interview with the
queen.

The two friends departed--Aramis to return to Paris, Athos to take
measures preparatory to an interview with the queen.
80. The Gratitude of Anne of Austria.
Athos found much less difficulty than he had expected in obtaining an
audience of Anne of Austria. It was granted, and was to take place after
NA
he was entitled to be present. A vast crowd filled the apartments of
Saint Germain. Anne had never at the Louvre had so large a court; but
this crowd represented chiefly the second class of nobility, while the
Prince de Conti, the Duc de Beaufort and the coadjutor assembled around
them the first nobility of France.
The greatest possible gayety prevailed at court. The particular
characteristic of this was that more songs were made than cannons fired
during its continuance. The court made songs on the Parisians and the
Parisians on the court; and the casualties, though not mortal, were
painful, as are all wounds inflicted by the weapon of ridicule.
In the midst of this seeming hilarity, nevertheless, peopleâ€™s minds were
uneasy. Was Mazarin to remain the favorite and minister of the queen?
Was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there? Every
one hoped so, so that the minister felt that all around him, beneath the
homage of the courtiers, lay a fund of hatred, ill disguised by fear and
interest. He felt ill at ease and at a loss what to do.
Conde himself, whilst fighting for him, lost no opportunity of
ridiculing, of humbling him. The queen, on whom he threw himself as sole
support, seemed to him now not much to be relied upon.
When the hour appointed for the audience arrived Athos was obliged to
stay until the queen, who was waited upon by a new deputation from
Paris, had consulted with her minister as to the propriety and manner of
receiving them. All were fully engrossed with the affairs of the day;
Athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to
speak of his friends--poor atoms, lost in that raging whirlwind.
But Athos was a man of inflexible determination; he firmly adhered to a
purpose once formed, when it seemed to him to spring from conscience and
to be prompted by a sense of duty. He insisted on being introduced,
saying that although he was not a deputy from Monsieur de Conti, or
Monsieur de Beaufort, or Monsieur de Bouillon, or Monsieur dâ€™Elbeuf, or
the coadjutor, or Madame de Longueville, or Broussel, or the Parliament,
and although he had come on his own private account, he nevertheless had
things to say to her majesty of the utmost importance.
The conference being finished, the queen summoned him to her cabinet.
Athos was introduced and announced by name. It was a name that too often
resounded in her majestyâ€™s ears and too often vibrated in her heart for
Anne of Austria not to recognize it; yet she remained impassive, looking
at him with that fixed stare which is tolerated only in women who are
queens, either by the power of beauty or by the right of birth.
NA
of Austria, after a momentâ€™s silence.
NA
not seem to recognize him.
Athos had a noble heart, and made, therefore, but a poor courtier.
Anne frowned. Mazarin, who was sitting at a table folding up papers, as
if he had only been a secretary of state, looked up.

Mazarin turned again to his papers.

Monsieur du Vallon, sent to England by the cardinal, suddenly

â€œI address myself, therefore, first to the benevolence of your majesty,

Scarcely, however, had the tapestry closed behind Athos when she said to

Athos was not altogether the queenâ€™s dupe, but he was not a man to run
away on suspicion--above all, when distinctly told that he should see
his friends again. He waited, then, in the ante-chamber with impatience,
till he should be conducted to them.
He walked to the window and looked into the court. He saw the deputation
from the Parisians enter it; they were coming to assign the definitive
place for the conference and to make their bow to the queen. A very
imposing escort awaited them without the gates.
Athos was looking on attentively, when some one touched him softly on
the shoulder.
NA
â€œYes, count, and charged with a commission for which I beg of you to

Athos smiled and opened the window.

Athos followed Comminges without saying a single word.
81. Cardinal Mazarin as King.
The arrest produced no sensation, indeed was almost unknown, and
scarcely interrupted the course of events. To the deputation it was
formally announced that the queen would receive it.
Accordingly, it was admitted to the presence of Anne, who, silent and
lofty as ever, listened to the speeches and complaints of the deputies;
but when they had finished their harangues not one of them could say, so
calm remained her face, whether or no she had heard them.
On the other hand, Mazarin, present at that audience, heard very well
what those deputies demanded. It was purely and simply his removal, in
terms clear and precise.
The discourse being finished, the queen remained silent.
NA
put an end to the miseries of her subjects. I have done all in my power
to ameliorate them and yet the belief of the public, you say, is that
they proceed from me, an unhappy foreigner, who has been unable to
please the French. Alas! I have never been understood, and no wonder. I
succeeded a man of the most sublime genius that ever upheld the sceptre
of France. The memory of Richelieu annihilates me. In vain--were I an
ambitious man--should I struggle against such remembrances as he has
left; but that I am not ambitious I am going to prove to you. I own
myself conquered. I shall obey the wishes of the people. If Paris has
injuries to complain of, who has not some wrongs to be redressed? Paris
has been sufficiently punished; enough blood has flowed, enough misery
has humbled a town deprived of its king and of justice. â€˜Tis not for me,
a private individual, to disunite a queen from her kingdom. Since you

A transient pallor overspread the speaking countenance of the prime
minister; he looked at the queen with anxiety. Her face was so
passionless, that he, as every one else present, was incapable of
reading her thoughts.

The deputies bowed and left the room.

NA

NA
Anne dropped her head and fell into one of those reveries so habitual
with her. A recollection of Athos came into her mind. His fearless
deportment, his words, so firm, yet dignified, the shades which by one
word he had evoked, recalled to her the past in all its intoxication of
poetry and romance, youth, beauty, the eclat of love at twenty years of
age, the bloody death of Buckingham, the only man whom she had ever
really loved, and the heroism of those obscure champions who had saved
her from the double hatred of Richelieu and the king.
Mazarin looked at her, and whilst she deemed herself alone and freed
from the world of enemies who sought to spy into her secret thoughts, he
read her thoughts in her countenance, as one sees in a transparent lake
clouds pass--reflections, like thoughts, of the heavens.
NA
NA
Mazarin smiled sarcastically at this speech, which showed that she had
taken the ministerâ€™s proposal seriously.
Anneâ€™s head was bent down--she had not seen the Italianâ€™s smile; but
finding that her question elicited no reply she looked up.
NA
â€œI am thinking, madame, of the allusion made by that insolent gentleman,
whom you have caused to be arrested, to the Duke of Buckingham--to him
whom you allowed to be assassinated--to the Duchess de Chevreuse, whom
you suffered to be exiled--to the Duc de Beaufort, whom you imprisoned;
but if he made allusion to me it was because he is ignorant of the

Anne drew up, as she always did, when anything touched her pride. She
blushed, and that she might not answer, clasped her beautiful hands till
her sharp nails almost pierced them.
â€œThat man has sagacity, honor and wit, not to mention likewise that he
is a man of undoubted resolution. You know something about him, do you
not, madame? I shall tell him, therefore, and in doing so I shall confer
a personal favor on him, how he is mistaken in regard to me. What is
proposed to me would be, in fact, almost an abdication, and an

This was one of the humiliations which Mazarin made Anne undergo more
frequently than any other, and one that bowed her head with shame. Queen
Elizabeth and Catherine II. of Russia are the only two monarchs of their
set on record who were at once sovereigns and lovers. Anne of Austria
looked with a sort of terror at the threatening aspect of the
cardinal--his physiognomy in such moments was not destitute of a certain
grandeur.

Anne frowned slightly when Mazarin, in taking leave, kissed her hand.

disdainful smile was seen playing, then gradually burst upon her lips.
NA

82. Precautions.
After quitting Anne, Mazarin took the road to Rueil, where he usually
resided; in those times of disturbance he went about with numerous
followers and often disguised himself. In military dress he was, indeed,
as we have stated, a very handsome man.
In the court of the old Chateau of Saint Germain he entered his coach,
and reached the Seine at Chatou. The prince had supplied him with fifty
light horse, not so much by way of guard as to show the deputies how
readily the queenâ€™s generals dispersed their troops and to prove that
they might be safely scattered at pleasure. Athos, on horseback, without
his sword and kept in sight by Comminges, followed the cardinal in
silence. Grimaud, finding that his master had been arrested, fell back
into the ranks near Aramis, without saying a word and as if nothing had
happened.
Grimaud had, indeed, during twenty-two years of service, seen his master
extricate himself from so many difficulties that nothing less than
Athosâ€™s imminent death was likely to make him uneasy.
At the branching off of the road toward Paris, Aramis, who had followed
in the cardinalâ€™s suite, turned back. Mazarin went to the right hand and
Aramis could see the prisoner disappear at the turning of the avenue.
Athos, at the same moment, moved by a similar impulse, looked back also.
The two friends exchanged a simple inclination of the head and Aramis
put his finger to his hat, as if to bow, Athos alone comprehending by
that signal that he had some project in his head.
Ten minutes afterward Mazarin entered the court of that chateau which
his predecessor had built for him at Rueil; as he alighted, Comminges
approached him.
NA
NA
â€œIn the pavilion of the orangery, of course, in front of the pavilion
where the guard is. I wish every respect to be shown the count, although

Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan is confined--that is, in the hunting lodge, opposite

Comminges smiled; Mazarin read and construed that smile.
â€œYou do not know these men, Monsieur Comminges, but I know them, first
personally, also by hearsay. I sent them to carry aid to King Charles
and they performed prodigies to save him; had it not been for an adverse

his ironical smile, â€œonly guests; but guests so precious that I have put
a grating before each of their windows and bolts to their doors, that
they may not refuse to continue my visitors. So much do I esteem them
that I am going to make the Comte de la Fere a visit, that I may
converse with him tete-a-tete, and that we may not be disturbed at our
interview you must conduct him, as I said before, to the pavilion of the
orangery; that, you know, is my daily promenade. Well, while taking my
walk I will call on him and we will talk. Although he professes to be my
enemy I have sympathy for him, and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall

Comminges bowed, and returned to Athos, who was awaiting with apparent
calmness, but with real anxiety, the result of the interview.

NA
NA

how dear to you is the young man who came so valiantly to my aid when
that old rogue of a Broussel was arrested. I am entirely at your

â€œThank you, sir; what I am about to ask will not compromise you in any

than you do. I serve the queen and that draws me naturally into the
service of the cardinal; but I serve the one with joy and the other
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, then, do me the kindness to give him my regards and tell him that
I am his neighbor. Tell him also what you have just told me--that
Mazarin has placed me in the pavilion of the orangery in order to make
me a visit, and assure him that I shall take advantage of this honor he
proposes to accord to me to obtain from him some amelioration of our

NA
NA
NA
â€œOh! thatâ€™s a different thing; yes, I know there are traditions of that

was a great nobleman; but our Mazarin--impossible! an Italian adventurer
would not dare to go such lengths with such men as ourselves. Oubliettes
are employed as a means of kingly vengeance, and a low-born fellow such
as he is would not have recourse to them. Your arrest is known, that of
your friends will soon be known; and all the nobility of France would
demand an explanation of your disappearance. No, no, be easy on that
score. I will, however, inform Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan of your arrival
NA
Comminges then led the count to a room on the ground floor of a
pavilion, at the end of the orangery. They passed through a courtyard as
they went, full of soldiers and courtiers. In the centre of this court,
in the form of a horseshoe, were the buildings occupied by Mazarin, and
at each wing the pavilion (or smaller building), where Dâ€™Artagnan was
confined, and that, level with the orangery, where Athos was to be. From
the ends of these two wings extended the park.
Athos, when he reached his appointed room, observed through the gratings
of his window, walls and roofs; and was told, on inquiry, by Comminges,
that he was looking on the back of the pavilion where Dâ€™Artagnan was
confined.
NA
singular fancy this is of yours, count--you, who are the very flower of
our nobility--to squander your valor and loyalty amongst these upstarts,
the Frondists! Really, count, if ever I thought that I had a friend in
the ranks of the royal army, it was you. A Frondeur! you, the Comte de
la Fere, on the side of Broussel, Blancmesnil and Viole! For shame! you,
NA
NA
Frondeur. For a long time I had these words whispered in my ears, and I
chose the latter; at any rate, it is a French word. And now, I am a
Frondeur--not of Brousselâ€™s party, nor of Blancmesnilâ€™s, nor am I with
Viole; but with the Duc de Beaufort, the Ducs de Bouillon and dâ€™Elbeuf;
with princes, not with presidents, councillors and low-born lawyers.
Besides, what a charming outlook it would have been to serve the
cardinal! Look at that wall--without a single window--which tells you
NA
NA
NA
NA
of the traits of his character, â€œso brave, so good, so terrible to the

NA
came here, Monsieur Dâ€™Artagnan provoked and braved the soldiers and
inferior officers, in order, I suppose, to have his sword back. That
mood lasted some time; but now heâ€™s as gentle as a lamb and sings Gascon
NA
NA
â€œAh, heâ€™s quite another sort of person--a formidable gentleman, indeed.
The first day he broke all the doors in with a single push of his
shoulder; and I expected to see him leave Rueil in the same way as
Samson left Gaza. But his temper cooled down, like his friendâ€™s; he not
NA
NA
NA
Comminges, who, putting together what Mazarin had said of his prisoners
and what the Comte de la Fere had said, began to feel a degree of
uneasiness.
Athos, on the other hand, reflected that this recent gentleness of his
friends most certainly arose from some plan formed by Dâ€™Artagnan.
Unwilling to injure them by praising them too highly, he replied: â€œThey?
They are two hotheads--the one a Gascon, the other from Picardy; both
are easily excited, but they quiet down immediately. You have had a
NA
This, too, was the opinion of Comminges, who withdrew somewhat
reassured. Athos remained alone in the vast chamber, where, according to
the cardinalâ€™s directions, he was treated with all the courtesy due to a
nobleman. He awaited Mazarinâ€™s promised visit to get some light on his
present situation.
83. Strength and Sagacity.
Now let us pass the orangery to the hunting lodge. At the extremity of
the courtyard, where, close to a portico formed of Ionic columns, were
the dog kennels, rose an oblong building, the pavilion of the orangery,
a half circle, inclosing the court of honor. It was in this pavilion, on
the ground floor, that Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos were confined, suffering
interminable hours of imprisonment in a manner suitable to each
different temperament.
Dâ€™Artagnan was pacing to and fro like a caged tiger; with dilated eyes,
growling as he paced along by the bars of a window looking upon the yard
of servantâ€™s offices.
Porthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just demolished.
The one seemed to be deprived of reason, yet he was meditating. The
other seemed to meditate, yet he was more than half asleep. But his
sleep was a nightmare, which might be guessed by the incoherent manner
in which he sometimes snored and sometimes snorted.
NA
NA
NA
NA
one could doze during the day, when he had the greatest difficulty in
sleeping during the night.

Dâ€™Artagnan shrugged his shoulders.

NA
NA
â€œYes, but before we can kill him--and he will be hard to kill, that
Swiss--he will shriek out and the whole picket will come, and we shall
be taken like foxes, we, who are lions, and thrown into some dungeon,
where we shall not even have the consolation of seeing this frightful
gray sky of Rueil, which no more resembles the sky of Tarbes than the
moon is like the sun. Lack-a-day! if we only had some one to instruct us
about the physical and moral topography of this castle. Ah! when one
thinks that for twenty years, during which time I did not know what to

â€œDo you know, my dear fellow, why master pastrycooks never work with

â€œIt is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of

NA
â€œWe ought, in our adventures, never to be defeated or give any one a
chance to laugh at us. In England, lately, we failed, we were beaten,
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThat is true, and that will redeem us a little in the eyes of
posterity, if posterity ever looks at us. But listen, Porthos: though
Monsieur Mordaunt was a man not to be despised, Mazarin is not less
strong than he, and we shall not easily succeed in drowning him. We
NA
sigh, â€œwe two are equal, perhaps, to eight others; but we are not equal
NA
NA
â€œWell, Porthos, follow my examples; walk back and forth till some news
of our friends reaches us or till we are visited by a good idea. But
donâ€™t sleep as you do all the time; nothing dulls the intellect like
sleep. As to what may lie before us, it is perhaps less serious than we
at first thought. I donâ€™t believe that Monsieur de Mazarin thinks of
cutting off our heads, for heads are not taken off without previous
trial; a trial would make a noise, and a noise would get the attention
NA
NA
NA
they put us on trial, if they cut off our heads, they must meanwhile

â€œWell, it is impossible but that Master Aramis, that keen-scented
bloodhound, and Athos, that wise and prudent nobleman, will discover our

NA
â€œNo, the other cardinal would have done so, but this one is too mean a

NA
â€œWell, then, assume a cheerful manner, as I do; we must joke with the
guards, we must gain the good-will of the soldiers, since we canâ€™t
corrupt them. Try, Porthos, to please them more than you are wont to do
when they are under our windows. Thus far you have done nothing but show
them your fist; and the more respectable your fist is, Porthos, the less
attractive it is. Ah, I would give much to have five hundred louis,

The two prisoners were at this point of their conversation when
Comminges entered, preceded by a sergeant and two men, who brought
supper in a basket with two handles, filled with basins and plates.

Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s penetrating gray eyes were opened to the utmost.
NA
â€œWell, I am desired by him to give you his compliments and to say that

Dâ€™Artagnan almost leaped with joy. A quick glance conveyed his thought
to Porthos: â€œIf Athos knows where we are, if he opens communication with

The arms of Dâ€™Artagnan fell powerless by his side. One might have
supposed him thunderstruck; a paleness ran like a cloud over his dark
skin, but disappeared immediately.

Suddenly Dâ€™Artagnan looked up and in his eyes there was a gleam which
scarcely even Porthos observed; but it died away and he appeared more
sorrowful than before.

Brousselâ€™s arrest, had saved him from the hands of the Parisians, had
entertained a real affection for him, â€œdonâ€™t be unhappy; I never thought
of bringing you bad news. Laugh at the chance which has brought your

But Dâ€™Artagnan was still in a desponding mood.

â€œMonsieur de Mazarin will not come to visit the Comte de la Fere, but

NA

â€œThat is it; they are waiting for the cardinal, or rather for Bernouin,

NA
â€œThen, if he should forget that visit, you would find no inconvenience

This skillful turn of the conversation would have seemed a sublime
manoeuvre to any one who could have read the Gasconâ€™s soul.

NA
NA

De Comminges went away, Dâ€™Artagnan remaining apparently in the same
attitude of humble resignation; but scarcely had he departed when he
turned and clasped Porthos in his arms with an expression not to be
doubted.

â€œSit down, dear friend, to table. When one is eating, ideas flow easily.

So Porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an
appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him
by Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s inventive imagination.
84. Strength and Sagacity--Continued.
Supper was eaten in silence, but not in sadness; for from time to time
one of those sweet smiles which were habitual to him in moments of
good-humor illumined the face of Dâ€™Artagnan. Not a scintilla of these
was lost on Porthos; and at every one he uttered an exclamation which
betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which
possessed his brain.
At dessert Dâ€™Artagnan reposed in his chair, crossed one leg over the
other and lounged about like a man perfectly at his ease.
Porthos rested his chin on his hands, placed his elbows on the table and
looked at Dâ€™Artagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to
that colossus an admirable appearance of good-fellowship.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œTo get away you would not mind, you added, knocking down a door or a

NA
â€œAnd I answered you, Porthos, that it was not a good plan; that we
couldnâ€™t go a hundred steps without being recaptured, because we were

NA
â€œUseless to look; everything will come to us when wanted. At about what

NA
â€œIf they go out to-day as they did yesterday we shall have the honor,

Porthos unbuttoned his sleeve, raised his shirt and looked complacently
on his strong arm, as large as the leg of any ordinary man.

bursting it--of killing an ox with a blow of his fist and carrying it
home on his shoulders, et cetera. I used to learn all these feat by
heart yonder, down at Pierrefonds, and I have done all that he did
NA
NA
NA
naivete.
â€œWell, my dear friend, let us approach the window and there you can

Porthos went to the window, took a bar in his hands, clung to it and
bent it like a bow; so that the two ends came out of the sockets of
stone in which for thirty years they had been fixed.
â€œWell! friend, the cardinal, although such a genius, could never have

NA
NA
Porthos tried, and passed the upper portion of his body through.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Porthos obeyed with military promptness and passed his arm through the
opening.

NA

NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œListen, my dear friend; in two words you will know all. The door of the

Porthos remained silent and motionless.
In fact, the two soldiers advanced on the side where the window was,
rubbing their hands, for it was cold, it being the month of February.
At this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the
soldiers was summoned away.
NA
him. Donâ€™t lose a word of what Iâ€™m going to say to you, Porthos.
NA
NA
â€œI know it well. I depend on you. Look, I shall turn to the left, so
that the soldier will be at your right, as soon as he mounts on the

â€œHe will; rely upon it. As soon as you see him get up, stretch out your
arm and seize him by the neck. Then, raising him up as Tobit raised the

NA
â€œTo be sure there would only be a Swiss the less in the world; but you
will not do so, I hope. Lay him down here; weâ€™ll gag him and tie him--no
matter where--somewhere. So we shall get from him one uniform and a

NA
profound admiration.

The two friends then placed themselves as they had agreed, Porthos being
completely hidden in an angle of the window.

â€œWith all my heart. How convenient that thereâ€™s a bench here. Egad! one

NA
And Dâ€™Artagnan coughed.
That instant the arm of Porthos fell. His hand of iron grasped, quick as
lightning, firm as a pair of blacksmithâ€™s pincers, the soldierâ€™s throat.
He raised him, almost stifling him as he drew him through the aperture,
at the risk of flaying him in the passage. He then laid him down on the
floor, where Dâ€™Artagnan, after giving him just time enough to draw his
breath, gagged him with his long scarf; and the moment he had done so
began to undress him with the promptitude and dexterity of a man who had
learned his business on the field of battle. Then the soldier, gagged
and bound, was placed upon the hearth, the fire of which had been
previously extinguished by the two friends.

manoeuvre again; it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same
way, and a failure would be ruinous. No; I will go down, seize the man

NA
NA
He did as he said. Porthos seized his opportunity, caught the next
soldier by his neck, gagged him and pushed him like a mummy through the
bars into the room, and entered after him. Then they undressed him as
they had done the first, laid him on their bed and bound him with the
straps which composed the bed--the bedstead being of oak. This operation
proved as great a success as the first.

It happened, however, that the second soldier was a Swiss of gigantic
proportions, so, save that some few of the seams split, his uniform
fitted Porthos perfectly.
They then dressed themselves.

The soldiers were complaisant; they had found the grasp of Porthos
pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against it.

NA
â€œIn a moment the valet-de-chambre will call the guard, as he did

â€œWait a little, Porthos, before crying out; for, on my word, you havenâ€™t
NA
NA
NA
And slipping through the aperture, he alighted in the court. Porthos
followed him by the same road, but with more difficulty and less
diligence. They could hear the two soldiers shivering with fear, as they
lay bound in the chamber.
Scarcely had the two Frenchmen touched the ground when a door opened and
the voice of the valet-de-chambre called out:

At the same moment the guardhouse was opened and a voice called out:

These two newly enlisted soldiers marched gravely after the
valet-de-chambre, who opened the door of the vestibule, then another
which seemed to be that of a waiting-room, and showing them two stools:

person implicitly. On your return you cannot make a mistake. You have

Dâ€™Artagnan was known to this valet-de-chambre, who was no other than
Bernouin, and he had during the last six or eight months introduced the
Gascon a dozen times to the cardinal. The Gascon, therefore, instead of
NA
accent possible.
As for Porthos, on whom Dâ€™Artagnan had impressed the necessity of
absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme
of his friend, which was to follow Mazarin in his visit to Athos, he was
simply mute. All that he was allowed to say, in case of emergencies, was
the proverbial Der Teufel!
Bernouin shut the door and went away. When Porthos heard the key turn in
the lock he began to be alarmed, lest they should only have exchanged
one prison for another.

now quite out of humor at seeing things take this turn.

forgive us, and it is she whom we have to consider. And then, besides,
the useless blood! never! no, never! I have my plan; let me carry it out
NA
NA
NA
The sound of a light step was heard in the vestibule. The hinges of the
door creaked and a man appeared in the dress of a cavalier, wrapped in a
brown cloak, with a lantern in one hand and a large beaver hat pulled
down over his eyes.
Porthos effaced himself against the wall, but he could not render
himself invisible; and the man in the cloak said to him, giving him his
lantern:
NA
Then addressing Dâ€™Artagnan:

NA
And advancing toward the door opposite to that by which he came in, he
opened it and disappeared behind it, shutting it as he went.
NA
â€œNow we shall make use of your shoulder, friend Porthos, if this door
proves to be locked. Everything in its proper time, and all comes right
to those who know how to wait patiently. But first barricade the first

The two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with
all the furniture in the room, as not only to make the passage
impassable, but so to block the door that by no means could it open
inward.
NA
85. The Oubliettes of Cardinal Mazarin.
At first, on arriving at the door through which Mazarin had passed,
Dâ€™Artagnan tried in vain to open it, but on the powerful shoulder of
Porthos being applied to one of the panels, which gave way, Dâ€™Artagnan
introduced the point of his sword between the bolt and the staple of the
lock. The bolt gave way and the door opened.
â€œAs I told you, everything can be attained, Porthos, women and doors, by

NA
They entered; behind a glass window, by the light of the cardinalâ€™s
lantern, which had been placed on the floor in the midst of the gallery,
they saw the orange and pomegranate trees of the Castle of Rueil, in
long lines, forming one great alley and two smaller side alleys.
NA
NA
Exploring, however, one of the side wings of the gallery, after making a
sign to Porthos to explore the other, he saw, all at once, at his left,
a tub containing an orange tree, which had been pushed out of its place
and in its place an open aperture.
Ten men would have found difficulty in moving that tub, but by some
mechanical contrivance it had turned with the flagstone on which it
rested.
Dâ€™Artagnan, as we have said, perceived a hole in that place and in this
hole the steps of a winding staircase.
He called Porthos to look at it.
NA
NA
â€œDonâ€™t you understand, Porthos? At the bottom of that staircase lies,
probably, the cardinalâ€™s treasury of which folk tell such wonders, and
we should only have to descend, empty a chest, shut the cardinal up in
it, double lock it, go away, carrying off as much gold as we could, put
back this orange-tree over the place, and no one in the world would ever

At the same moment, whilst Dâ€™Artagnan was leaning over the aperture to
listen, a metallic sound, as if some one was moving a bag of gold,
struck on his ear; he started; instantly afterward a door opened and a
light played upon the staircase.
Mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he
was walking about, but he had with him a waxlight, to help him to
explore his mysterious strong box.
NA
looking at a bag of reals, â€œfaith, thereâ€™s enough to pay five
councillors of parliament, and two generals in Paris. I am a great

The two friends were crouching down, meantime, behind a tub in the side
alley.
Mazarin came within three steps of Dâ€™Artagnan and pushed a spring in the
wall; the slab turned and the orange tree resumed its place.
Then the cardinal put out the waxlight, slipped it into his pocket, and
NA
NA
NA
All three set off on their walk, Mazarin taking the middle alley and the
friends the side ones.
The cardinal reached a second door without perceiving he was being
followed; the sand with which the alleys were covered deadened the sound
of footsteps.
He then turned to the left, down a corridor which had escaped the
attention of the two friends, but as he opened the door he paused, as if
in thought.
NA

order not to put myself at the mercy of that four-headed combination of

steps.

NA
And he made the same friendly salute as Dâ€™Artagnan.
Mazarin gazed at each of them with an affrighted stare, recognized them,
and let drop his lantern, uttering a cry of terror.
Dâ€™Artagnan picked it up; by good luck it had not been extinguished.
NA
about just here without a light. Your eminence might knock against
NA
NA
astonishment.
â€œYes, my lord, it is I. I have the honor to present to you Monsieur du
Vallon, that excellent friend of mine, in whom your eminence had the

began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole
undertaking.
NA
let us disarrange your eminence. Be so good as to show us the way and we

Mazarin was by degrees recovering his senses.
NA
remembering the visits he had been paying to his treasury.
Porthos opened his mouth to reply; Dâ€™Artagnan made him a sign, and his
mouth, remaining silent, gradually closed.
NA
Mazarin breathed again. His fears were now no longer for his hoard, but
for himself. A sort of smile played on his lips.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œCertainly; and on the other hand, my lord, you have lost it, and now,
NA
Mazarin felt a shiver run through him--a chill even to his heartâ€™s core.
His piercing look was fixed in vain on the satirical face of the Gascon
and the unchanging countenance of Porthos. Both were in shadow and the
Sybil of Cuma herself could not have read them.
NA
NA
NA
â€œZounds, my lord, I donâ€™t know yet. We must ask the Comte de la Fere the
question. Will your eminence deign to open the door which leads to the

Mazarin started.
NA
all formality and due respect; but I must warn you that we have no time
to lose; open the door then, my lord, and be so good as to remember,
once for all, that on the slightest attempt to escape or the faintest
cry for help, our position being very critical indeed, you must not be

Dâ€™Artagnan made a sign to Porthos to redouble his watchfulness; then
turning to Mazarin:

Mazarin turned the lock of a double door, on the threshold of which they
found Athos ready to receive his illustrious guests according to the
notice Comminges had given him.
On perceiving Mazarin he bowed.

NA

and even in a manner somewhat impolite, perhaps, so great was our

At that voice, that mocking tone, and that familiar gesture, accenting

gentlemen being my prisoners I am theirs; but, gentlemen, I warn you,
unless you kill me, your victory will be of very short duration; people

turning to the left, you will find the wall of the park; get over it,

NA
minister, and Mazarin, who was delighted to get off so cheaply, led the
way, in high spirits, to the corridor and opened the door.
It led into the park, as the three fugitives perceived by the night
breeze which rushed into the corridor and blew the wind into their
faces.
NA
donâ€™t know the locality, and shall never find the wall. Since your
eminence has come so far, come a few steps further; conduct us, my lord,
NA
NA
to the wall, at the foot of which they all four arrived at the same
instant.
NA
â€œI think so, indeed; we should be hard to please if we were not. Deuce
take it! three poor gentlemen escorted by a prince of the church! Ah!
apropos, my lord! you remarked that we were all active, vigorous and

NA
â€œYou are mistaken. Monsieur du Vallon and I are the only two who are
armed. The count is not; and should we meet with one of your patrol we

NA
NA
Porthos, who lifted him up like a feather, arrived at the top.
NA
Athos jumped and disappeared on the other side of the wall.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œPorthos, whilst I get up, watch the cardinal. No, I donâ€™t want your

NA
â€œYou are right; it is more difficult than I thought. Lend me your

Porthos lent him his back and Dâ€™Artagnan was soon on the summit of the
wall, where he seated himself.
Mazarin pretended to laugh.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Mazarin wished to call out, but Porthos held him tight and passed him to
Dâ€™Artagnan, who seized him by the neck and made him sit down by him;
then in a menacing tone, he said:
â€œSir! jump directly down, close to Monsieur de la Fere, or, on the honor
NA
NA
NA
Mazarin groaned.
NA
â€œAgreed; but the ransom of that immense treasure buried under the
gallery, to which one descends on pushing a spring hidden in the wall,
which causes a tub to turn, revealing a staircase--must not one speak of
NA
NA
NA
But without listening to his protestations of alarm, Dâ€™Artagnan slipped
him gently down into the arms of Athos, who stood immovable at the
bottom of the wall.
Porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall, and by the aid
of his friendâ€™s hand gained the summit.
NA
NA
â€œYou think so? so much the better; but that it may prove laughter-worthy
NA
Porthos did the same.
NA
NA
The Gascon then drew his sword and marched as avant guard.
NA
should your eminence be mistaken, there might ensue most grave results
NA
NA
NA
The three friends hastened on, but in a short time were obliged to
slacken the pace. The cardinal could not keep up with them, though with
every wish to do so.
Suddenly Dâ€™Artagnan touched something warm, which moved.
NA
NA
NA
the cardinalâ€™s arm.
â€œThereâ€™s luck, my lord! just as you were complaining of being tired and

But as he spoke the barrel of a pistol was presented at his breast and
these words were pronounced:

NA
NA
NA

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA

NA
NA
NA

And believing that no one could execute the commission better than
himself, Grimaud set off at full speed; whilst, enchanted at being all
together again, the friends awaited his return.
There was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except Cardinal
Mazarin.
87. Thinking that Porthos will be at last a Baron, and Dâ€™Artagnan a
Captain.
At the expiration of ten minutes Aramis arrived, accompanied by Grimaud
and eight or ten followers. He was excessively delighted and threw
himself into his friendsâ€™ arms.
â€œYou are free, my brothers! free without my aid! and I shall have

Rueil to Saint Germain, twenty are dispersed in the woods. Thus I was
able, thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces, to intercept two

Mazarin listened intently.
NA
NA
NA
such delicacy of sentiment! In one of the despatches the cardinal
declares to the queen that the treasury is empty and that her majesty
has no more money. In the other he announces that he is about to
transport his prisoners to Melun, since Rueil seemed to him not
sufficiently secure. You can understand, dear friend, with what hope I
was inspired by that last letter. I placed myself in ambuscade with my
sixty men; I encircled the castle; the riding horses I entrusted to
Grimaud and I awaited your coming out, which I did not expect till
to-morrow, and I didnâ€™t hope to free you without a skirmish. You are
free to-night, without fighting; so much the better! How did you manage
to escape that scoundrel Mazarin? You must have much reason to complain
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, he had us conducted into the orangery by Monsieur Bernouin, his
valet-de-chambre, and from there we followed him to visit the Comte de
la Fere. Then he offered us our liberty and we accepted it. He even went
so far as to show us the way out; he led us to the park wall, which we
NA
NA
were here that I might tell him that I did not believe him capable of so
NA
NA
to introduce to you the Chevalier dâ€™Herblay, who wishes--as you may have

And he retired, discovering Mazarin, who was in great confusion, to the
astonished gaze of Aramis.

Several horsemen ran quickly to him.

Saint Christopher, Porthos, who performed this feat! Apropos! I

horsemen.

NA

NA
For one moment the young man forgot his habitual respect--he threw
himself on his fatherâ€™s neck.
NA
NA
continued, addressing the cavaliers, who became more and more numerous
every instant; â€œgentlemen, encircle his eminence, that you may show him
the greater honor. He will, indeed give us the favor of his company; you
will, I hope, be grateful for it; Porthos, do not lose sight of his

Aramis then joined Athos and Dâ€™Artagnan, who were consulting together.
NA
NA
NA
â€œTo your house, dear Porthos, at Pierrefonds; your fine chateau is
worthy of affording its princely hospitality to his eminence; it is,
likewise, well situated--neither too near Paris, nor too far from it; we
can establish a communication between it and the capital with great
facility. Come, my lord, you shall be treated like a prince, as you

NA
NA
NA
NA
The rest of the night was employed by these cavaliers in traveling with
the wonderful rapidity of former days. Mazarin, still sombre and
pensive, permitted himself to be dragged along in this way; it looked a
race of phantoms. At dawn twelve leagues had been passed without drawing
rein; half the escort were exhausted and several horses fell down.
NA
NA
NA
fresh horses--one for his eminence, four for us. We, at least, must keep
close to monseigneur; the rest of the start will rejoin us later. Once
NA
Grimaud, in fact, brought back five horses. The nobleman to whom he
applied, being a friend of Porthos, was very ready, not to sell them, as
was proposed, but to lend them. Ten minutes later the escort stopped at
Ermenonville, but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor,
guarding Mazarin carefully. At noon they rode into the avenue of
Pierrefonds.
NA
speaking a word on the journey, â€œyou may think what you will, sir, but I
NA
and he put his horse to a gallop to announce to the other servants the
arrival of Monsieur du Vallon and his friends.
NA
mounting guard over my lord and each of us must watch three hours at a
time. Athos is going to examine the castle, which it will be necessary
to render impregnable in case of siege; Porthos will see to the
provisions and Aramis to the troops of the garrison. That is to say,
Athos will be chief engineer, Porthos purveyor-in-general, and Aramis

Meanwhile, they gave up to Mazarin the handsomest room in the chateau.

a spectator of the scene.

â€œI require, my lord, that Normandy should be given to Madame de

christening, should go to proffer his homage to our Holy Father the

Mazarin made a grimace which was quite indescribable, and then turned to
Dâ€™Artagnan.
NA
NA
entirely as to the last point, though I agree with him on the first. Far
from wishing my lord to quit Paris, I hope he will stay there and
continue to be prime minister, as he is a great statesman. I shall try
also to help him to down the Fronde, but on one condition--that he
sometimes remembers the kingâ€™s faithful servants and gives the first
vacant company of musketeers to a man that I could name. And you,
NA
NA
NA
honor to my house, which gives him an asylum, would in remembrance of
this adventure erect my estate into a barony, with a promise to confer
that order on one of my particular friends, whenever his majesty next
NA
NA
â€œMy friends will submit them. Besides, should it be necessary,
NA
Mazarin bit his lips; the blow was direct and he replied rather dryly:
â€œAll this appears to me to be ill conceived, disjointed, gentlemen; for
if I satisfy some I shall displease others. If I stay in Paris I cannot
go to Rome; if I became pope I could not continue to be prime minister;
and it is only by continuing prime minister that I can make Monsieur

Mazarin arose, walked some moments, thoughtful, but not dejected.

NA
Mazarin started, turned toward the Comte de la Fere, and looking for an
instant at that grand and honest countenance, took the pen.

NA
NA
88. Shows how with Threat and Pen more is effected than by the Sword.
Dâ€™Artagnan knew his part well; he was aware that opportunity has a
forelock only for him who will take it and he was not a man to let it go
by him without seizing it. He soon arranged a prompt and certain manner
of traveling, by sending relays of horses to Chantilly, so that he might
be in Paris in five or six hours. But before setting out he reflected
that for a lad of intelligence and experience he was in a singular
predicament, since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving
certainty behind him.
NA
mission, â€œAthos, for generosity, is a hero of romance; Porthos has an
excellent disposition, but is easily influenced; Aramis has a
hieroglyphic countenance, always illegible. What will come out of those
three elements when I am no longer present to combine them? The
deliverance of the cardinal, perhaps. Now, the deliverance of the
cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes; and our hopes are thus far the
only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of

pressed Aramisâ€™s hand and went in search of Porthos.

our fortune, that, at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of
our labours, it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow
yourself to be controlled by Aramis, whose cunning you know--a cunning
which, we may say between ourselves, is not always without egotism; or
by Athos, a noble and disinterested man, but blase, who, desiring
nothing further for himself, doesnâ€™t sympathize with the desires of
others. What should you say if either of these two friends proposed to

â€œI needed nothing less than that consideration, my dear Dâ€™Artagnan, to
persuade myself to adopt the role of jailer. I give you my word that you

NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan started alone on his journey, without other escort than his
sword, and with a simple passport from Mazarin to secure his admission
to the queenâ€™s presence. Six hours after he left Pierrefonds he was at
Saint Germain.
The disappearance of Mazarin was not as yet generally known. Anne of
Austria was informed of it and concealed her uneasiness from every one.
In the chamber of Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos the two soldiers had been found
bound and gagged. On recovering the use of their limbs and tongues they
could, of course, tell nothing but what they knew--that they had been
seized, stripped and bound. But as to what had been done by Porthos and
Dâ€™Artagnan afterward they were as ignorant as all the inhabitants of the
chateau.
Bernouin alone knew a little more than the others. Bernouin, seeing that
his master did not return and hearing the stroke of midnight, had made
an examination of the orangery. The first door, barricaded with
furniture, had aroused in him certain suspicions, but without
communicating his suspicions to any one he had patiently worked his way
into the midst of all that confusion. Then he came to the corridor, all
the doors of which he found open; so, too, was the door of Athosâ€™s
chamber and that of the park. From the latter point it was easy to
follow tracks on the snow. He saw that these tracks tended toward the
wall; on the other side he found similar tracks, then footprints of
horses and then signs of a troop of cavalry which had moved away in the
direction of Enghien. He could no longer cherish any doubt that the
cardinal had been carried off by the three prisoners, since the
prisoners had disappeared at the same time; and he had hastened to Saint
Germain to warn the queen of that disappearance.
Anne had enforced the utmost secrecy and had disclosed the event to no
one except the Prince de Conde, who had sent five or six hundred
horsemen into the environs of Saint Germain with orders to bring in any
suspicious person who was going away from Rueil, in whatsoever direction
it might be.
Now, since Dâ€™Artagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen, since he
was alone, since he was not going away from Rueil and was going to Saint
Germain, no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not
obstructed in any way.
On entering the courtyard of the old chateau the first person seen by
our ambassador was Maitre Bernouin in person, who, standing on the
threshold, awaited news of his vanished master.
At the sight of Dâ€™Artagnan, who entered the courtyard on horseback,
Bernouin rubbed his eyes and thought he must be mistaken. But Dâ€™Artagnan
made a friendly sign to him with his head, dismounted, and throwing his
bridle to a lackey who was passing, he approached the valet-de-chambre
with a smile on his lips.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAbsolutely nothing. He felt the need of making a trip in the Ile de
France, and begged us--the Comte de la Fere and Monsieur du Vallon--to
accompany him. We were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of

â€œHis eminence had something to communicate to her majesty, something
secret and private--a mission that could be confided only to a sure
man--and so has sent me to Saint Germain. And therefore, my dear
Monsieur Bernouin, if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your
master, announce to her majesty that I have come, and tell her with what
NA
Whether he spoke seriously or in jest, since it was evident that under
existing circumstances Dâ€™Artagnan was the only man who could relieve the
queenâ€™s uneasiness, Bernouin went without hesitation to announce to her
this strange embassy; and as he had foreseen, the queen gave orders to
introduce Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan at once.
Dâ€™Artagnan approached the sovereign with every mark of profound respect,
and having fallen on his knees presented to her the cardinalâ€™s letter
It was, however, merely a letter of introduction. The queen read it,
recognized the writing, and, since there were no details in it of what
had occurred, asked for particulars. Dâ€™Artagnan related everything with
that simple and ingenuous air which he knew how to assume on occasions.
The queen, as he went on, looked at him with increasing astonishment.
She could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and
still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose
interest and almost duty it was to punish him.
NA
NA
â€œPardon, madame, but I think that either I have expressed myself badly
or your majesty has imperfectly understood me. There is here no question
of crime or treason. Monsieur de Mazarin held us in prison, Monsieur du
Vallon and myself, because we could not believe that he had sent us to
England to quietly look on while they cut off the head of Charles I.,
brother-in-law of the late king, your husband, the consort of Madame
Henrietta, your sister and your guest, and because we did all that we
could do to save the life of the royal martyr. We were then convinced,
my friend and I, that there was some error of which we were the victims,
and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and
ourselves. Now, that an explanation may bear fruit, it is necessary that
it should be quietly conducted, far from noise and interruption. We have
therefore taken away monsieur le cardinal to my friendâ€™s chateau and
there we have come to an understanding. Well, madame, it proved to be as
we had supposed; there was a mistake. Monsieur de Mazarin had thought
that we had rendered service to General Cromwell, instead of King
Charles, which would have been a disgrace, rebounding from us to him,
and from him to your majesty--a dishonor which would have tainted the
royalty of your illustrious son. We were able to prove the contrary, and
that proof we are ready to give to your majesty, calling in support of
it the august widow weeping in the Louvre, where your royal munificence
has provided for her a home. That proof satisfied him so completely
that, as a sign of satisfaction, he has sent me, as your majesty may
see, to consider with you what reparation should be made to gentlemen
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
that in ten minutes you shall be arrested, and in an hour I shall set
NA
â€œI am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence,
first, because it would be useless and would produce the most disastrous
results. Before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be
dead; and indeed, so convinced is he of this, that he entreated me,
should I find your majesty disposed to act in this way, to do all I

NA
â€œMadame, the possibility of my arrest has been foreseen, and should I
not have returned by to-morrow, at a certain hour the next day the

â€œIt is evident, sir, that your position has kept you out of relation to
men and affairs; otherwise you would know that since we left Paris
monsieur le cardinal has returned thither five or six times; that he has
there met De Beaufort, De Bouillon, the coadjutor and Dâ€™Elbeuf and that
NA
â€œYour pardon, madame, I know all that. And therefore my friends will
conduct monsieur le cardinal neither to De Beaufort, nor to De Bouillon,
nor to the coadjutor, nor to Dâ€™Elbeuf. These gentlemen wage war on
private account, and in buying them up, by granting them what they
wished, monsieur le cardinal has made a good bargain. He will be
delivered to the parliament, members of which can, of course, be bought,

heart beats in this bosom--a heart devoted to you--believe that you have

Heaven!--risked our lives twenty times for your majesty. Have you, then,
madame, no compassion for your servants who for twenty years have
vegetated in obscurity, without betraying in a single sigh the solemn
and sacred secrets they have had the honor to share with you? Look at
me, madame--at me, whom you accuse of speaking loud and threateningly.
What am I? A poor officer, without fortune, without protection, without
a future, unless the eye of my queen, which I have sought so long, rests
on me for a moment. Look at the Comte de la Fere, a type of nobility, a
flower of chivalry. He has taken part against his queen, or rather,
against her minister. He has not been unreasonably exacting, it seems to
me. Look at Monsieur du Vallon, that faithful soul, that arm of steel,
who for twenty years has awaited the word from your lips which will make
him in rank what he is in sentiment and in courage. Consider, in short,
your people who love you and who yet are famished, who have no other
wish than to bless you, and who, nevertheless--no, I am wrong, your
subjects, madame, will never curse you; say one word to them and all
will be ended--peace succeed war, joy tears, and happiness to

Anne of Austria looked with wonderment on the warlike countenance of

at the bottom of this schedule, which has been drawn up by Mazarin, as
you see:
NA
Anne was caught, she could not draw back--she signed; but scarcely had
she done so when pride burst forth and she began to weep.
Dâ€™Artagnan started on seeing these tears. Since that period of history
queens have shed tears, like other women.
The Gascon shook his head, these tears from royalty melted his heart.
NA
begs you to believe that at a gesture of your majesty everything will be
possible to him. He has faith in himself; he has faith in his friends;
he wishes also to have faith in his queen. And in proof that he fears
nothing, that he counts on nothing, he will restore Monsieur de Mazarin
to your majesty without conditions. Behold, madame! here are the august
signatures of your majestyâ€™s hand; if you think you are right in giving
them to me, you shall do so, but from this very moment you are free from

And Dâ€™Artagnan, full of splendid pride and manly intrepidity, placed in
Anneâ€™s hands, in a bundle, the papers that he had one by one won from
her with so much difficulty.
There are moments--for if everything is not good, everything in this
world is not bad--in which the most rigid and the coldest soul is
softened by the tears of strong emotion, heart-arraigning sentiment: one
of these momentary impulses actuated Anne. Dâ€™Artagnan, when he gave way
to his own feelings--which were in accordance with those of the
queen--had accomplished more than the most astute diplomacy could have
attempted. He was therefore instantly recompensed, either for his
address or for his sensibility, whichever it might be termed.

And with this conclusion--a way peculiar to himself--he rose and left

In twenty-four hours Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos conducted Mazarin to the
queen; and the one received his commission, the other his patent of
nobility.
On the same day the Treaty of Paris was signed, and it was everywhere
announced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order
to draw it up with the greatest care.
Here is what each of the parties concerned gained by that treaty:
Monsieur de Conti received Damvilliers, and having made his proofs as
general, he succeeded in remaining a soldier, instead of being made
cardinal. Moreover, something had been said of a marriage with Mazarinâ€™s
niece. The idea was welcomed by the prince, to whom it was of little
importance whom he married, so long as he married some one.
The Duc de Beaufort made his entrance at court, receiving ample
reparation for the wrongs he had suffered, and all the honor due to his
rank. Full pardon was accorded to those who had aided in his escape. He
received also the office of admiral, which had been held by his father,
the Duc de Vendome and an indemnity for his houses and castles,
demolished by the Parliament of Bretagne.
The Duc de Bouillon received domains of a value equal to that of his
principality of Sedan, and the title of prince, granted to him and to
those belonging to his house.
The Duc de Longueville gained the government of Pont-de-lâ€™Arche, five
hundred thousand francs for his wife and the honor of seeing her son
held at the baptismal font by the young king and Henrietta of England.
Aramis stipulated that Bazin should officiate at that ceremony and that
Planchet should furnish the christening sugar plums.
The Duc dâ€™Elbeuf obtained payment of certain sums due to his wife, one
hundred thousand francs for his eldest son and twenty-five thousand for
each of the three others.
The coadjutor alone obtained nothing. They promised, indeed, to
negotiate with the pope for a cardinalâ€™s hat for him; but he knew how
little reliance should be placed on such promises, made by the queen and
Mazarin. Quite contrary to the lot of Monsieur de Conti, unable to be
cardinal, he was obliged to remain a soldier.
And therefore, when all Paris was rejoicing in the expected return of
the king, appointed for the next day, Gondy alone, in the midst of the
general happiness, was dissatisfied; he sent for the two men whom he was
wont to summon when in especially bad humor. Those two men were the
Count de Rochefort and the mendicant of Saint Eustache. They came with
their usual promptness, and the coadjutor spent with them a part of the
night.
89. Difficult for Kings to return to the Capitals of their Kingdoms.
Whilst Dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos were engaged in conducting the cardinal to
Saint Germain, Athos and Aramis returned to Paris.
Each had his own particular visit to make.
Aramis rushed to the Hotel de Ville, where Madame de Longueville was
sojourning. The duchess loudly lamented the announcement of peace. War
had made her a queen; peace brought her abdication. She declared that
she would never assent to the treaty and that she wished eternal war.
But when Aramis had presented that peace to her in a true light--that is
to say, with all its advantages; when he had pointed out to her, in
exchange for the precarious and contested royalty of Paris, the
viceroyalty of Font-de-lâ€™Arche, in other words, of all Normandy; when he
had rung in her ears the five hundred thousand francs promised by the
cardinal; when he had dazzled her eyes with the honor bestowed on her by
the king in holding her child at the baptismal font, Madame de
Longueville contended no longer, except as is the custom with pretty
women to contend, and defended herself only to surrender at last.
Aramis made a presence of believing in the reality of her opposition and
was unwilling to deprive himself in his own view of the credit of her
conversion.
NA
brother--that is to say, the greatest captain of the age; and when women
of genius wish anything they always succeed in attaining it. You have
succeeded; the prince is beaten, since he can no longer fight. Now
attach him to our party. Withdraw him gently from the queen, whom he
does not like, from Mazarin, whom he despises. The Fronde is a comedy,
of which the first act only is played. Let us wait for a denouement--for
the day when the prince, thanks to you, shall have turned against the

Madame de Longueville was persuaded. This Frondist duchess trusted so
confidently to the power of her fine eyes, that she could not doubt
their influence even over Monsieur de Conde; and the chronicles of the
time aver that her confidence was justified.
Athos, on quitting Aramis, went to Madame de Chevreuse. Here was another
frondeuse to persuade, and she was even less open to conviction than her
younger rival. There had been no stipulation in her favor. Monsieur de
Chevreuse had not been appointed governor of a province, and if the
queen should consent to be godmother it could be only of her grandson or
granddaughter. At the first announcement of peace Madame de Chevreuse
frowned, and in spite of all the logic of Athos to show her that a
prolonged war would have been impracticable, contended in favor of
hostilities.

The duchess smiled, half tenderly, half ironically.
NA
NA
â€œYes, madame; I have that of the Garter, which King Charles I. gave me

NA
Athos took her hand and kissed it. She sighed, as she looked at him.
NA
NA
She sighed again and leaned her charming head, gracefully reclined, on
her hand, still beautiful in form and color.
NA
NA
The duchess shook her head.
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo, madame; if you have forgotten the history of Oedipus, I, at least,
NA
â€œReally, sir, you are delightful, and I should like to spend a month at

Athos became thoughtful.

Raoul entered at this moment; he came to announce that the solemn
entrance of the king, queen, and her ministers was to take place on the
ensuing day.
The next day, in fact, at daybreak, the court made preparations to quit
Saint Germain.
Meanwhile, the queen every hour had been sending for Dâ€™Artagnan.

As he left the queenâ€™s presence Bernouin summoned him to the cardinal.

NA
This arrangement pleased every one. The queen had confidence in the
courage of Dâ€™Artagnan, which she knew, and the cardinal in the strength
of Porthos, which he had experienced.
The royal procession set out for Paris. Guitant and Comminges, at the
head of the guards, marched first; then came the royal carriage, with
Dâ€™Artagnan on one side, Porthos on the other; then the musketeers, for
two and twenty years staunch friends of Dâ€™Artagnan. During twenty he had
been lieutenant, their captain since the night before.
The cortege proceeded to Notre Dame, where a Te Deum was chanted. All
Paris were in the streets. The Swiss were drawn up along the road, but
as the road was long, they were placed at six or eight feet distant from
each other and one deep only. This force was therefore wholly
insufficient, and from time to time the line was broken through by the
people and was formed again with difficulty. Whenever this occurred,
although it proceeded only from goodwill and a desire to see the king
and queen, Anne looked at Dâ€™Artagnan anxiously.
Mazarin, who had dispensed a thousand louis to make the people cry â€œLong
NA
bought at twenty pistoles each, kept one eye on Porthos; but that
gigantic body-guard replied to the look with his great bass voice, â€œBe
NA
At the Palais Royal, the crowd, which had flowed in from the adjacent
street was still greater; like an impetuous mob, a wave of human beings
came to meet the carriage and rolled tumultuously into the Rue Saint
Honore.
When the procession reached the palace, loud cries of â€œLong live their
NA
NA
hisses and yells stifled them remorselessly. Mazarin turned pale and
shrank back in the coach.
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan said nothing, but twirled his mustache with a peculiar
gesture which showed that his fine Gascon humor was awake.
Anne of Austria bent down and whispered in the young kingâ€™s ear:
NA
The young king leaned toward the door.
NA
â€œnevertheless, I have remarked you. It was you who were behind my

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œHem! brave as you are and strong as you are, you could not kill them
NA
NA
NA
NA
Mazarin to himself, and he threw himself back in his carriage.
The queen and her minister, more especially the latter, had reason to
feel anxious. The crowd, whilst preserving an appearance of respect and
even of affection for the king and queen regent, began to be tumultuous.
Reports were whispered about, like certain sounds which announce, as
they whistle from wave to wave, the coming storm--and when they pass
athwart a multitude, presage an emeute.
Dâ€™Artagnan turned toward the musketeers and made a sign imperceptible to
the crowd, but very easily understood by that chosen regiment, the
flower of the army.
The ranks closed firmly in and a kind of majestic tremor ran from man to
man.
At the Barriere des Sergents the procession was obliged to stop.
Comminges left the head of the escort and went to the queenâ€™s carriage.
Anne questioned Dâ€™Artagnan by a look. He answered in the same language.
NA
Comminges returned to his post. An effort was made and the living
barrier was violently broken through.
Some complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the
king as well as the minister.
NA
NA
But as if the multitude had waited only for this demonstration to burst
out, all the sentiments of hostility that possessed it exploded
NA
resounded on all sides.
At the same time through the streets of Grenelle, Saint Honore, and Du
Coq, a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of Swiss guards
and came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of Porthosâ€™s horse and
that of Dâ€™Artagnan.
This new eruption was more dangerous than the others, being composed of
armed men. It was plain that it was not the chance combination of those
who had collected a number of the malcontents at the same spot, but a
concerted organized attack.
Each of these mobs was led by a chief, one of whom appeared to belong,
not to the people, but to the honorable corporation of mendicants, and
the other, notwithstanding his affected imitation of the people, might
easily be discerned to be a gentleman. Both were evidently stimulated by
the same impulse.
There was a shock which was perceived even in the royal carriage.
Myriads of hoarse cries, forming one vast uproar, were heard, mingled
with guns firing.
NA
The escort divided into two files. One of them passed around to the
right of the carriage, the other to the left. One went to support
Dâ€™Artagnan, the other Porthos. Then came a skirmish, the more terrible
because it had no definite object; the more melancholy, because those
engaged in it knew not for whom they were fighting. Like all popular
movements, the shock given by the rush of this mob was formidable. The
musketeers, few in number, not being able, in the midst of this crowd,
to make their horses wheel around, began to give way. Dâ€™Artagnan offered
to lower the blinds of the royal carriage, but the young king stretched
out his arm, saying:
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan. And turning with that fury which made him so formidable, he
rushed toward the chief of the insurgents, a man who, with a huge sword
in his hand, was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the
musketeers.
NA
At these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head, but it
was too late. The blow was sped by Dâ€™Artagnan; the rapier had pierced
his bosom.
NA
NA
NA
have already got up again after three stabs from you, I shall never rise
NA
NA
knowing that it was you. I am sorry, if you die, that you should die
NA
Rochefort extended his hand to Dâ€™Artagnan, who took it. The count wished
to speak, but a gush of blood stifled him. He stiffened in the last
convulsions of death and expired.
NA
NA
Indeed, as if De Rochefort had been the very soul of the attack, the
crowd who had followed and obeyed him took to flight on seeing him fall.
Dâ€™Artagnan charged, with a party of musketeers, up the Rue du Coq, and
the portion of the mob he assailed disappeared like smoke, dispersing
near the Place Saint Germain-lâ€™Auxerrois and taking the direction of the
quays.
Dâ€™Artagnan returned to help Porthos, if Porthos needed help; but
Porthos, for his part, had done his work as conscientiously as
Dâ€™Artagnan. The left of the carriage was as well cleared as the right,
and they drew up the blind of the window which Mazarin, less heroic than
the king, had taken the precaution to lower.
Porthos looked very melancholy.
â€œWhat a devil of a face you have, Porthos! and what a strange air for a

â€œWell! exactly like me! I have just killed a man whose face is not

In fact, the procession arrived, in safety at Notre Dame, at the front
gate of which all the clergy, with the coadjutor at their head, awaited
the king, the queen and the minister, for whose happy return they
chanted a Te Deum.
As the service was drawing to a close a boy entered the church in great
excitement, ran to the sacristy, dressed himself quickly in the choir
robes, and cleaving, thanks to that uniform, the crowd that filled the
temple, approached Bazin, who, clad in his blue robe, was standing
gravely in his place at the entrance to the choir.
Bazin felt some one pulling his sleeve. He lowered to earth his eyes,
beatifically raised to Heaven, and recognized Friquet.
â€œWell, you rascal, what is it? How do you dare to disturb me in the

In fact, he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke to
him privately a few words, to which the latter responded by an
affirmative sign. He then returned with the same slow step and said:

success of his embassy, Friquet started off at the top of his speed.
When the Te Deum was over, the coadjutor, without stopping to change his
priestly dress, took his way toward that old tower which he knew so
well. He arrived in time. Though sinking from moment to moment, the
wounded man was not yet dead. The door was opened to the coadjutor of
the room in which the mendicant was suffering.
A moment later Friquet went out, carrying in his hand a large leather
bag; he opened it as soon as he was outside the chamber and to his great
astonishment found it full of gold. The mendicant had kept his word and
made Friquet his heir.
NA
He could say no more; but though he hadnâ€™t strength to speak he had
enough for action. He rushed headlong to the street, and like the Greek
from Marathon who fell in the square at Athens, with his laurel in his
hand, Friquet reached Councillor Brousselâ€™s threshold, and then fell
exhausted, scattering on the floor the louis disgorged by his leather
bag.
Mother Nanette began by picking up the louis; then she picked up
Friquet.
In the meantime the cortege returned to the Palais Royal.

On going home, the two friends found a letter from Athos, who desired
them to meet him at the Grand Charlemagne on the following day.
The friends went to bed early, but neither of them slept. When we arrive
at the summit of our wishes, success has usually the power to drive away
sleep on the first night after the fulfilment of long cherished hopes.
The next day at the appointed hour they went to see Athos and found him

The four friends embraced with tears in their eyes.
Then they departed, without knowing whether they would ever see each
other again.
Dâ€™Artagnan returned to the Rue Tiquetonne with Porthos, still possessed
by the wish to find out who the man was that he had killed. On arriving
at the Hotel de la Chevrette they found the baronâ€™s equipage all ready
and Mousqueton on his saddle.

paces, returned--stood still--struck his forehead with his finger and
exclaimed:

And Porthos, enchanted at having relieved his mind, rejoined Mousqueton
