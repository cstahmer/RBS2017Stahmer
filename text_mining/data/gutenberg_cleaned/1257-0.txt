AUTHORâ€™S PREFACE
In which it is proved that, notwithstanding their namesâ€™ ending in OS
and IS, the heroes of the story which we are about to have the honor to
relate to our readers have nothing mythological about them.
A short time ago, while making researches in the Royal Library for my
History of Louis XIV, I stumbled by chance upon the Memoirs of M.
dâ€™Artagnan, printed--as were most of the works of that period, in which
authors could not tell the truth without the risk of a residence, more
or less long, in the Bastille--at Amsterdam, by Pierre Rouge. The title
attracted me; I took them home with me, with the permission of the
guardian, and devoured them.
It is not my intention here to enter into an analysis of this curious
work; and I shall satisfy myself with referring such of my readers as
appreciate the pictures of the period to its pages. They will therein
find portraits penciled by the hand of a master; and although these
squibs may be, for the most part, traced upon the doors of barracks and
the walls of cabarets, they will not find the likenesses of Louis XIII,
Anne of Austria, Richelieu, Mazarin, and the courtiers of the period,
less faithful than in the history of M. Anquetil.
But, it is well known, what strikes the capricious mind of the poet is
not always what affects the mass of readers. Now, while admiring, as
others doubtless will admire, the details we have to relate, our main
preoccupation concerned a matter to which no one before ourselves had
given a thought.
Dâ€™Artagnan relates that on his first visit to M. de Treville, captain of
the kingâ€™s Musketeers, he met in the antechamber three young men,
serving in the illustrious corps into which he was soliciting the honor
of being received, bearing the names of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.
We must confess these three strange names struck us; and it immediately
occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms, under which dâ€™Artagnan had
disguised names perhaps illustrious, or else that the bearers of these
borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which, from
caprice, discontent, or want of fortune, they had donned the simple
Musketeerâ€™s uniform.
From that moment we had no rest till we could find some trace in
contemporary works of these extraordinary names which had so strongly
awakened our curiosity.
The catalogue alone of the books we read with this object would fill a
whole chapter, which, although it might be very instructive, would
certainly afford our readers but little amusement. It will suffice,
then, to tell them that at the moment at which, discouraged by so many
fruitless investigations, we were about to abandon our search, we at
length found, guided by the counsels of our illustrious friend Paulin
Paris, a manuscript in folio, endorsed 4772 or 4773, we do not recollect
which, having for title, â€œMemoirs of the Comte de la Fere, Touching Some
Events Which Passed in France Toward the End of the Reign of King Louis
NA
It may be easily imagined how great was our joy when, in turning over
this manuscript, our last hope, we found at the twentieth page the name
of Athos, at the twenty-seventh the name of Porthos, and at the
thirty-first the name of Aramis.
The discovery of a completely unknown manuscript at a period in which
historical science is carried to such a high degree appeared almost
miraculous. We hastened, therefore, to obtain permission to print it,
with the view of presenting ourselves someday with the pack of others at
the doors of the Academie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, if we
should not succeed--a very probable thing, by the by--in gaining
admission to the Academie Francaise with our own proper pack. This
permission, we feel bound to say, was graciously granted; which compels
us here to give a public contradiction to the slanderers who pretend
that we live under a government but moderately indulgent to men of
letters.
Now, this is the first part of this precious manuscript which we offer
to our readers, restoring it to the title which belongs to it, and
entering into an engagement that if (of which we have no doubt) this
first part should obtain the success it merits, we will publish the
second immediately.
In the meanwhile, as the godfather is a second father, we beg the reader
to lay to our account, and not to that of the Comte de la Fere, the
pleasure or the ENNUI he may experience.
This being understood, let us proceed with our history.
1 THE THREE PRESENTS OF Dâ€™ARTAGNAN THE ELDER
On the first Monday of the month of April, 1625, the market town of
Meung, in which the author of ROMANCE OF THE ROSE was born, appeared to
be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the Huguenots had just made
a second La Rochelle of it. Many citizens, seeing the women flying
toward the High Street, leaving their children crying at the open doors,
hastened to don the cuirass, and supporting their somewhat uncertain
courage with a musket or a partisan, directed their steps toward the
hostelry of the Jolly Miller, before which was gathered, increasing
every minute, a compact group, vociferous and full of curiosity.
In those times panics were common, and few days passed without some city
or other registering in its archives an event of this kind. There were
nobles, who made war against each other; there was the king, who made
war against the cardinal; there was Spain, which made war against the
king. Then, in addition to these concealed or public, secret or open
wars, there were robbers, mendicants, Huguenots, wolves, and scoundrels,
who made war upon everybody. The citizens always took up arms readily
against thieves, wolves or scoundrels, often against nobles or
Huguenots, sometimes against the king, but never against the cardinal or
Spain. It resulted, then, from this habit that on the said first Monday
of April, 1625, the citizens, on hearing the clamor, and seeing neither
the red-and-yellow standard nor the livery of the Duc de Richelieu,
rushed toward the hostel of the Jolly Miller. When arrived there, the
cause of the hubbub was apparent to all.
A young man--we can sketch his portrait at a dash. Imagine to yourself a
Don Quixote of eighteen; a Don Quixote without his corselet, without his
coat of mail, without his cuisses; a Don Quixote clothed in a woolen
doublet, the blue color of which had faded into a nameless shade between
lees of wine and a heavenly azure; face long and brown; high cheek
bones, a sign of sagacity; the maxillary muscles enormously developed,
an infallible sign by which a Gascon may always be detected, even
without his cap--and our young man wore a cap set off with a sort of
feather; the eye open and intelligent; the nose hooked, but finely
chiseled. Too big for a youth, too small for a grown man, an experienced
eye might have taken him for a farmerâ€™s son upon a journey had it not
been for the long sword which, dangling from a leather baldric, hit
against the calves of its owner as he walked, and against the rough side
of his steed when he was on horseback.
For our young man had a steed which was the observed of all observers.
It was a Bearn pony, from twelve to fourteen years old, yellow in his
hide, without a hair in his tail, but not without windgalls on his legs,
which, though going with his head lower than his knees, rendering a
martingale quite unnecessary, contrived nevertheless to perform his
eight leagues a day. Unfortunately, the qualities of this horse were so
well concealed under his strange-colored hide and his unaccountable
gait, that at a time when everybody was a connoisseur in horseflesh, the
appearance of the aforesaid pony at Meung--which place he had entered
about a quarter of an hour before, by the gate of Beaugency--produced an
unfavorable feeling, which extended to his rider.
And this feeling had been more painfully perceived by young
dâ€™Artagnan--for so was the Don Quixote of this second Rosinante
named--from his not being able to conceal from himself the ridiculous
appearance that such a steed gave him, good horseman as he was. He had
sighed deeply, therefore, when accepting the gift of the pony from M.
dâ€™Artagnan the elder. He was not ignorant that such a beast was worth at
least twenty livres; and the words which had accompanied the present
were above all price.
NA
which Henry IV could never rid himself, â€œthis horse was born in the
house of your father about thirteen years ago, and has remained in it
ever since, which ought to make you love it. Never sell it; allow it to
die tranquilly and honorably of old age, and if you make a campaign with
it, take as much care of it as you would of an old servant. At court,
NA
the elder, â€œ--an honor to which, remember, your ancient nobility gives
you the right--sustain worthily your name of gentleman, which has been
worthily borne by your ancestors for five hundred years, both for your
own sake and the sake of those who belong to you. By the latter I mean
your relatives and friends. Endure nothing from anyone except Monsieur
the Cardinal and the king. It is by his courage, please observe, by his
courage alone, that a gentleman can make his way nowadays. Whoever
hesitates for a second perhaps allows the bait to escape which during
that exact second fortune held out to him. You are young. You ought to
be brave for two reasons: the first is that you are a Gascon, and the
second is that you are my son. Never fear quarrels, but seek adventures.
I have taught you how to handle a sword; you have thews of iron, a wrist
of steel. Fight on all occasions. Fight the more for duels being
forbidden, since consequently there is twice as much courage in
fighting. I have nothing to give you, my son, but fifteen crowns, my
horse, and the counsels you have just heard. Your mother will add to
them a recipe for a certain balsam, which she had from a Bohemian and
which has the miraculous virtue of curing all wounds that do not reach
the heart. Take advantage of all, and live happily and long. I have but
one word to add, and that is to propose an example to you--not mine, for
I myself have never appeared at court, and have only taken part in
religious wars as a volunteer; I speak of Monsieur de Treville, who was
formerly my neighbor, and who had the honor to be, as a child, the
play-fellow of our king, Louis XIII, whom God preserve! Sometimes their
play degenerated into battles, and in these battles the king was not
always the stronger. The blows which he received increased greatly his
esteem and friendship for Monsieur de Treville. Afterward, Monsieur de
Treville fought with others: in his first journey to Paris, five times;
from the death of the late king till the young one came of age, without
reckoning wars and sieges, seven times; and from that date up to the
present day, a hundred times, perhaps! So that in spite of edicts,
ordinances, and decrees, there he is, captain of the Musketeers; that is
to say, chief of a legion of Caesars, whom the king holds in great
esteem and whom the cardinal dreads--he who dreads nothing, as it is
said. Still further, Monsieur de Treville gains ten thousand crowns a
year; he is therefore a great noble. He began as you begin. Go to him
with this letter, and make him your model in order that you may do as he
NA
Upon which M. dâ€™Artagnan the elder girded his own sword round his son,
kissed him tenderly on both cheeks, and gave him his benediction.
On leaving the paternal chamber, the young man found his mother, who was
waiting for him with the famous recipe of which the counsels we have
just repeated would necessitate frequent employment. The adieux were on
this side longer and more tender than they had been on the other--not
that M. dâ€™Artagnan did not love his son, who was his only offspring, but
M. dâ€™Artagnan was a man, and he would have considered it unworthy of a
man to give way to his feelings; whereas Mme. dâ€™Artagnan was a woman,
and still more, a mother. She wept abundantly; and--let us speak it to
the praise of M. dâ€™Artagnan the younger--notwithstanding the efforts he
made to remain firm, as a future Musketeer ought, nature prevailed, and
he shed many tears, of which he succeeded with great difficulty in
concealing the half.
The same day the young man set forward on his journey, furnished with
the three paternal gifts, which consisted, as we have said, of fifteen
crowns, the horse, and the letter for M. de Treville--the counsels being
thrown into the bargain.
With such a VADE MECUM dâ€™Artagnan was morally and physically an exact
copy of the hero of Cervantes, to whom we so happily compared him when
our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his
portrait. Don Quixote took windmills for giants, and sheep for armies;
dâ€™Artagnan took every smile for an insult, and every look as a
provocation--whence it resulted that from Tarbes to Meung his fist was
constantly doubled, or his hand on the hilt of his sword; and yet the
fist did not descend upon any jaw, nor did the sword issue from its
scabbard. It was not that the sight of the wretched pony did not excite
numerous smiles on the countenances of passers-by; but as against the
side of this pony rattled a sword of respectable length, and as over
this sword gleamed an eye rather ferocious than haughty, these
passers-by repressed their hilarity, or if hilarity prevailed over
prudence, they endeavored to laugh only on one side, like the masks of
the ancients. Dâ€™Artagnan, then, remained majestic and intact in his
susceptibility, till he came to this unlucky city of Meung.
But there, as he was alighting from his horse at the gate of the Jolly
Miller, without anyone--host, waiter, or hostler--coming to hold his
stirrup or take his horse, dâ€™Artagnan spied, though an open window on
the ground floor, a gentleman, well-made and of good carriage, although
of rather a stern countenance, talking with two persons who appeared to
listen to him with respect. Dâ€™Artagnan fancied quite naturally,
according to his custom, that he must be the object of their
conversation, and listened. This time dâ€™Artagnan was only in part
mistaken; he himself was not in question, but his horse was. The
gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors;
and, as I have said, the auditors seeming to have great deference for
the narrator, they every moment burst into fits of laughter. Now, as a
half-smile was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man,
the effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily
imagined.
Nevertheless, dâ€™Artagnan was desirous of examining the appearance of
this impertinent personage who ridiculed him. He fixed his haughty eye
upon the stranger, and perceived a man of from forty to forty-five years
of age, with black and piercing eyes, pale complexion, a strongly marked
nose, and a black and well-shaped mustache. He was dressed in a doublet
and hose of a violet color, with aiguillettes of the same color, without
any other ornaments than the customary slashes, through which the shirt
appeared. This doublet and hose, though new, were creased, like
traveling clothes for a long time packed in a portmanteau. Dâ€™Artagnan
made all these remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer, and
doubtless from an instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to
have a great influence over his future life.
Now, as at the moment in which dâ€™Artagnan fixed his eyes upon the
gentleman in the violet doublet, the gentleman made one of his most
knowing and profound remarks respecting the Bearnese pony, his two
auditors laughed even louder than before, and he himself, though
contrary to his custom, allowed a pale smile (if I may be allowed to use
such an expression) to stray over his countenance. This time there could
be no doubt; dâ€™Artagnan was really insulted. Full, then, of this
conviction, he pulled his cap down over his eyes, and endeavoring to
copy some of the court airs he had picked up in Gascony among young
traveling nobles, he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword and
the other resting on his hip. Unfortunately, as he advanced, his anger
increased at every step; and instead of the proper and lofty speech he
had prepared as a prelude to his challenge, he found nothing at the tip
of his tongue but a gross personality, which he accompanied with a
furious gesture.
â€œI say, sir, you sir, who are hiding yourself behind that shutter--yes,
NA
The gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier, as if
he required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that such
strange reproaches were addressed; then, when he could not possibly
entertain any doubt of the matter, his eyebrows slightly bent, and with
an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described, he replied
NA
NA
exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners, of
politeness and scorn.
The stranger looked at him again with a slight smile, and retiring from
the window, came out of the hostelry with a slow step, and placed
himself before the horse, within two paces of dâ€™Artagnan. His quiet
manner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the
mirth of the persons with whom he had been talking, and who still
remained at the window.
Dâ€™Artagnan, seeing him approach, drew his sword a foot out of the
scabbard.
NA
resumed the stranger, continuing the remarks he had begun, and
addressing himself to his auditors at the window, without paying the
least attention to the exasperation of dâ€™Artagnan, who, however, placed
himself between him and them. â€œIt is a color very well known in botany,
NA
â€œThere are people who laugh at the horse that would not dare to laugh at
NA
NA
by the expression of my countenance; but nevertheless I retain the
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
hostelry by the front gate, beneath which dâ€™Artagnan on arriving had
observed a saddled horse.
But, dâ€™Artagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him thus
who had the insolence to ridicule him. He drew his sword entirely from
the scabbard, and followed him, crying, â€œTurn, turn, Master Joker, lest

NA
young man with as much astonishment as contempt. â€œWhy, my good fellow,
NA
NA
Majesty, who is seeking everywhere for brave fellows to recruit for his

He had scarcely finished, when dâ€™Artagnan made such a furious lunge at
him that if he had not sprung nimbly backward, it is probable he would
have jested for the last time. The stranger, then perceiving that the
matter went beyond raillery, drew his sword, saluted his adversary, and
seriously placed himself on guard. But at the same moment, his two
auditors, accompanied by the host, fell upon dâ€™Artagnan with sticks,
shovels and tongs. This caused so rapid and complete a diversion from
the attack that dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s adversary, while the latter turned round to
face this shower of blows, sheathed his sword with the same precision,
and instead of an actor, which he had nearly been, became a spectator of
the fight--a part in which he acquitted himself with his usual
impassiveness, muttering, nevertheless, â€œA plague upon these Gascons!
NA
NA
best face possible, and never retreating one step before his three
assailants, who continued to shower blows upon him.
NA
are incorrigible! Keep up the dance, then, since he will have it so.
NA
But the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with;
dâ€™Artagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter. The fight was
therefore prolonged for some seconds; but at length dâ€™Artagnan dropped
his sword, which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a stick.
Another blow full upon his forehead at the same moment brought him to
the ground, covered with blood and almost fainting.
It was at this moment that people came flocking to the scene of action
from all sides. The host, fearful of consequences, with the help of his
servants carried the wounded man into the kitchen, where some trifling
attentions were bestowed upon him.
As to the gentleman, he resumed his place at the window, and surveyed
the crowd with a certain impatience, evidently annoyed by their
remaining undispersed.
NA
noise of the door announced the entrance of the host, who came in to
inquire if he was unhurt.
NA
â€œOh, yes! Perfectly safe and sound, my good host; and I wish to know
NA
NA
NA
â€œBut before he fainted, he collected all his strength to challenge you,
NA
NA
NA
grin of contempt; â€œfor during his fainting we rummaged his valise and
found nothing but a clean shirt and eleven crowns--which however, did
not prevent his saying, as he was fainting, that if such a thing had
happened in Paris, you should have cause to repent of it at a later
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes; he struck his pocket and said, â€˜We shall see what Monsieur de

his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of Monsieur de
Treville? Now, my dear host, while your young man was insensible, you
did not fail, I am quite sure, to ascertain what that pocket contained.
NA
NA
NA
NA
The host, who was not endowed with great perspicacity, did not observe
the expression which his words had given to the physiognomy of the
stranger. The latter rose from the front of the window, upon the sill of
which he had leaned with his elbow, and knitted his brow like a man
disquieted.

on horseback, and go and meet her. I should like, however, to know what

    _*We are well aware that this term, milady, is only properly
            used when followed by a family name. But we find it thus
            in the manuscript, and we do not choose to take upon
            ourselves to alter it._
And the stranger, muttering to himself, directed his steps toward the
kitchen.
In the meantime, the host, who entertained no doubt that it was the
presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry,
re-ascended to his wifeâ€™s chamber, and found dâ€™Artagnan just recovering
his senses. Giving him to understand that the police would deal with him
pretty severely for having sought a quarrel with a great lord--for in
the opinion of the host the stranger could be nothing less than a great
lord--he insisted that notwithstanding his weakness dâ€™Artagnan should
get up and depart as quickly as possible. Dâ€™Artagnan, half stupefied,
without his doublet, and with his head bound up in a linen cloth, arose
then, and urged by the host, began to descend the stairs; but on
arriving at the kitchen, the first thing he saw was his antagonist
talking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage, drawn by two large
Norman horses.
His interlocutor, whose head appeared through the carriage window, was a
woman of from twenty to two-and-twenty years. We have already observed
with what rapidity dâ€™Artagnan seized the expression of a countenance. He
perceived then, at a glance, that this woman was young and beautiful;
and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally
different from that of the southern countries in which dâ€™Artagnan had
hitherto resided. She was pale and fair, with long curls falling in
profusion over her shoulders, had large, blue, languishing eyes, rosy
lips, and hands of alabaster. She was talking with great animation with
the stranger.

The stranger was about to reply; but at the moment he opened his mouth,

of the door.

pieces at the foot of mine host, galloped after his master.

his turn, after the servant. But his wound had rendered him too weak to
support such an exertion. Scarcely had he gone ten steps when his ears
began to tingle, a faintness seized him, a cloud of blood passed over
his eyes, and he fell in the middle of the street, crying still,
NA
NA
and endeavoring by this little flattery to make up matters with the
young man, as the heron of the fable did with the snail he had despised
the evening before.

It is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that remained
in dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s purse.
The host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day,
but he had reckoned without his guest. On the following morning at five
oâ€™clock dâ€™Artagnan arose, and descending to the kitchen without help,
asked, among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to
us, for some oil, some wine, and some rosemary, and with his motherâ€™s
recipe in his hand composed a balsam, with which he anointed his
numerous wounds, replacing his bandages himself, and positively refusing
the assistance of any doctor, dâ€™Artagnan walked about that same evening,
and was almost cured by the morrow.
But when the time came to pay for his rosemary, this oil, and the wine,
the only expense the master had incurred, as he had preserved a strict
abstinence--while on the contrary, the yellow horse, by the account of
the hostler at least, had eaten three times as much as a horse of his
size could reasonably be supposed to have done--dâ€™Artagnan found nothing
in his pocket but his little old velvet purse with the eleven crowns it
contained; for as to the letter addressed to M. de Treville, it had
disappeared.
The young man commenced his search for the letter with the greatest
patience, turning out his pockets of all kinds over and over again,
rummaging and rerummaging in his valise, and opening and reopening his
purse; but when he found that he had come to the conviction that the
letter was not to be found, he flew, for the third time, into such a
rage as was near costing him a fresh consumption of wine, oil, and
rosemary--for upon seeing this hot-headed youth become exasperated and
threaten to destroy everything in the establishment if his letter were
not found, the host seized a spit, his wife a broom handle, and the
servants the same sticks they had used the day before.

Unfortunately, there was one circumstance which created a powerful
obstacle to the accomplishment of this threat; which was, as we have
related, that his sword had been in his first conflict broken in two,
and which he had entirely forgotten. Hence, it resulted when dâ€™Artagnan
proceeded to draw his sword in earnest, he found himself purely and
simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in
length, which the host had carefully placed in the scabbard. As to the
rest of the blade, the master had slyly put that on one side to make
himself a larding pin.
But this deception would probably not have stopped our fiery young man
if the host had not reflected that the reclamation which his guest made
was perfectly just.

His threat completed the intimidation of the host. After the king and
the cardinal, M. de Treville was the man whose name was perhaps most
frequently repeated by the military, and even by citizens. There was, to
be sure, Father Joseph, but his name was never pronounced but with a
subdued voice, such was the terror inspired by his Gray Eminence, as the
cardinalâ€™s familiar was called.
Throwing down his spit, and ordering his wife to do the same with her
broom handle, and the servants with their sticks, he set the first
example of commencing an earnest search for the lost letter.

then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave them to the
host, who accompanied him, cap in hand, to the gate, and remounted his
yellow horse, which bore him without any further accident to the gate of
St. Antoine at Paris, where his owner sold him for three crowns, which
was a very good price, considering that dâ€™Artagnan had ridden him hard
during the last stage. Thus the dealer to whom dâ€™Artagnan sold him for
the nine livres did not conceal from the young man that he only gave
that enormous sum for him on the account of the originality of his
color.
Thus dâ€™Artagnan entered Paris on foot, carrying his little packet under
his arm, and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on terms
suited to the scantiness of his means. This chamber was a sort of
garret, situated in the Rue des Fossoyeurs, near the Luxembourg.
As soon as the earnest money was paid, dâ€™Artagnan took possession of his
lodging, and passed the remainder of the day in sewing onto his doublet
and hose some ornamental braiding which his mother had taken off an
almost-new doublet of the elder M. dâ€™Artagnan, and which she had given
her son secretly. Next he went to the Quai de Feraille to have a new
blade put to his sword, and then returned toward the Louvre, inquiring
of the first Musketeer he met for the situation of the hotel of M. de
Treville, which proved to be in the Rue du Vieux-Colombier; that is to
say, in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by dâ€™Artagnan--a
circumstance which appeared to furnish a happy augury for the success of
his journey.
After this, satisfied with the way in which he had conducted himself at
Meung, without remorse for the past, confident in the present, and full
of hope for the future, he retired to bed and slept the sleep of the
brave.
This sleep, provincial as it was, brought him to nine oâ€™clock in the
morning; at which hour he rose, in order to repair to the residence of
M. de Treville, the third personage in the kingdom, in the paternal
estimation.
2 THE ANTECHAMBER OF M. DE TREVILLE
M de Troisville, as his family was still called in Gascony, or M. de
Treville, as he has ended by styling himself in Paris, had really
commenced life as dâ€™Artagnan now did; that is to say, without a sou in
his pocket, but with a fund of audacity, shrewdness, and intelligence
which makes the poorest Gascon gentleman often derive more in his hope
from the paternal inheritance than the richest Perigordian or Berrichan
gentleman derives in reality from his. His insolent bravery, his still
more insolent success at a time when blows poured down like hail, had
borne him to the top of that difficult ladder called Court Favor, which
he had climbed four steps at a time.
He was the friend of the king, who honored highly, as everyone knows,
the memory of his father, Henry IV. The father of M. de Treville had
served him so faithfully in his wars against the league that in default
of money--a thing to which the Bearnais was accustomed all his life, and
who constantly paid his debts with that of which he never stood in need
of borrowing, that is to say, with ready wit--in default of money, we
repeat, he authorized him, after the reduction of Paris, to assume for
his arms a golden lion passant upon gules, with the motto FIDELIS ET
FORTIS. This was a great matter in the way of honor, but very little in
the way of wealth; so that when the illustrious companion of the great
Henry died, the only inheritance he was able to leave his son was his
sword and his motto. Thanks to this double gift and the spotless name
that accompanied it, M. de Treville was admitted into the household of
the young prince where he made such good use of his sword, and was so
faithful to his motto, that Louis XIII, one of the good blades of his
kingdom, was accustomed to say that if he had a friend who was about to
fight, he would advise him to choose as a second, himself first, and
Treville next--or even, perhaps, before himself.
Thus Louis XIII had a real liking for Treville--a royal liking, a
self-interested liking, it is true, but still a liking. At that unhappy
period it was an important consideration to be surrounded by such men as
Treville. Many might take for their device the epithet STRONG, which
formed the second part of his motto, but very few gentlemen could lay
claim to the FAITHFUL, which constituted the first. Treville was one of
these latter. His was one of those rare organizations, endowed with an
obedient intelligence like that of the dog; with a blind valor, a quick
eye, and a prompt hand; to whom sight appeared only to be given to see
if the king were dissatisfied with anyone, and the hand to strike this
displeasing personage, whether a Besme, a Maurevers, a Poltiot de Mere,
or a Vitry. In short, up to this period nothing had been wanting to
Treville but opportunity; but he was ever on the watch for it, and he
faithfully promised himself that he would not fail to seize it by its
three hairs whenever it came within reach of his hand. At last Louis
XIII made Treville the captain of his Musketeers, who were to Louis XIII
in devotedness, or rather in fanaticism, what his Ordinaries had been to
Henry III, and his Scotch Guard to Louis XI.
On his part, the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect. When
he saw the formidable and chosen body with which Louis XIII had
surrounded himself, this second, or rather this first king of France,
became desirous that he, too, should have his guard. He had his
Musketeers therefore, as Louis XIII had his, and these two powerful
rivals vied with each other in procuring, not only from all the
provinces of France, but even from all foreign states, the most
celebrated swordsmen. It was not uncommon for Richelieu and Louis XIII
to dispute over their evening game of chess upon the merits of their
servants. Each boasted the bearing and the courage of his own people.
While exclaiming loudly against duels and brawls, they excited them
secretly to quarrel, deriving an immoderate satisfaction or genuine
regret from the success or defeat of their own combatants. We learn this
from the memoirs of a man who was concerned in some few of these defeats
and in many of these victories.
Treville had grasped the weak side of his master; and it was to this
address that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not
left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his
friendships. He paraded his Musketeers before the Cardinal Armand
Duplessis with an insolent air which made the gray moustache of his
Eminence curl with ire. Treville understood admirably the war method of
that period, in which he who could not live at the expense of the enemy
must live at the expense of his compatriots. His soldiers formed a
legion of devil-may-care fellows, perfectly undisciplined toward all but
himself.
Loose, half-drunk, imposing, the kingâ€™s Musketeers, or rather M. de
Trevilleâ€™s, spread themselves about in the cabarets, in the public
walks, and the public sports, shouting, twisting their mustaches,
clanking their swords, and taking great pleasure in annoying the Guards
of the cardinal whenever they could fall in with them; then drawing in
the open streets, as if it were the best of all possible sports;
sometimes killed, but sure in that case to be both wept and avenged;
often killing others, but then certain of not rotting in prison, M. de
Treville being there to claim them. Thus M. de Treville was praised to
the highest note by these men, who adored him, and who, ruffians as they
were, trembled before him like scholars before their master, obedient to
his least word, and ready to sacrifice themselves to wash out the
smallest insult.
M de Treville employed this powerful weapon for the king, in the first
place, and the friends of the king--and then for himself and his own
friends. For the rest, in the memoirs of this period, which has left so
many memoirs, one does not find this worthy gentleman blamed even by his
enemies; and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among men
of the sword. In no instance, let us say, was this worthy gentleman
accused of deriving personal advantage from the cooperation of his
minions. Endowed with a rare genius for intrigue which rendered him the
equal of the ablest intriguers, he remained an honest man. Still
further, in spite of sword thrusts which weaken, and painful exercises
which fatigue, he had become one of the most gallant frequenters of
revels, one of the most insinuating ladyâ€™s men, one of the softest
whisperers of interesting nothings of his day; the BONNES FORTUNES of de
Treville were talked of as those of M. de Bassompierre had been talked
of twenty years before, and that was not saying a little. The captain of
the Musketeers was therefore admired, feared, and loved; and this
constitutes the zenith of human fortune.
Louis XIV absorbed all the smaller stars of his court in his own vast
radiance; but his father, a sun PLURIBUS IMPAR, left his personal
splendor to each of his favorites, his individual value to each of his
courtiers. In addition to the leeves of the king and the cardinal, there
might be reckoned in Paris at that time more than two hundred smaller
but still noteworthy leeves. Among these two hundred leeves, that of
Treville was one of the most sought.
The court of his hotel, situated in the Rue du Vieux-Colombier,
resembled a camp from by six oâ€™clock in the morning in summer and eight
oâ€™clock in winter. From fifty to sixty Musketeers, who appeared to
replace one another in order always to present an imposing number,
paraded constantly, armed to the teeth and ready for anything. On one of
those immense staircases, upon whose space modern civilization would
build a whole house, ascended and descended the office seekers of Paris,
who ran after any sort of favor--gentlemen from the provinces anxious to
be enrolled, and servants in all sorts of liveries, bringing and
carrying messages between their masters and M. de Treville. In the
antechamber, upon long circular benches, reposed the elect; that is to
say, those who were called. In this apartment a continued buzzing
prevailed from morning till night, while M. de Treville, in his office
contiguous to this antechamber, received visits, listened to complaints,
gave his orders, and like the king in his balcony at the Louvre, had
only to place himself at the window to review both his men and arms.
The day on which dâ€™Artagnan presented himself the assemblage was
imposing, particularly for a provincial just arriving from his province.
It is true that this provincial was a Gascon; and that, particularly at
this period, the compatriots of dâ€™Artagnan had the reputation of not
being easily intimidated. When he had once passed the massive door
covered with long square-headed nails, he fell into the midst of a troop
of swordsmen, who crossed one another in their passage, calling out,
quarreling, and playing tricks one with another. In order to make oneâ€™s
way amid these turbulent and conflicting waves, it was necessary to be
an officer, a great noble, or a pretty woman.
It was, then, into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young
man advanced with a beating heart, ranging his long rapier up his lanky
leg, and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap, with that half-smile
of the embarrassed provincial who wishes to put on a good face. When he
had passed one group he began to breathe more freely; but he could not
help observing that they turned round to look at him, and for the first
time in his life dâ€™Artagnan, who had till that day entertained a very
good opinion of himself, felt ridiculous.
Arrived at the staircase, it was still worse. There were four Musketeers
on the bottom steps, amusing themselves with the following exercise,
while ten or twelve of their comrades waited upon the landing place to
take their turn in the sport.
One of them, stationed upon the top stair, naked sword in hand,
prevented, or at least endeavored to prevent, the three others from
ascending.
These three others fenced against him with their agile swords.
Dâ€™Artagnan at first took these weapons for foils, and believed them to
be buttoned; but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every
weapon was pointed and sharpened, and that at each of these scratches
not only the spectators, but even the actors themselves, laughed like so
many madmen.
He who at the moment occupied the upper step kept his adversaries
marvelously in check. A circle was formed around them. The conditions
required that at every hit the man touched should quit the game,
yielding his turn for the benefit of the adversary who had hit him. In
five minutes three were slightly wounded, one on the hand, another on
the ear, by the defender of the stair, who himself remained intact--a
piece of skill which was worth to him, according to the rules agreed
upon, three turns of favor.
However difficult it might be, or rather as he pretended it was, to
astonish our young traveler, this pastime really astonished him. He had
seen in his province--that land in which heads become so easily
heated--a few of the preliminaries of duels; but the daring of these
four fencers appeared to him the strongest he had ever heard of even in
Gascony. He believed himself transported into that famous country of
giants into which Gulliver afterward went and was so frightened; and yet
he had not gained the goal, for there were still the landing place and
the antechamber.
On the landing they were no longer fighting, but amused themselves with
stories about women, and in the antechamber, with stories about the
court. On the landing dâ€™Artagnan blushed; in the antechamber he
trembled. His warm and fickle imagination, which in Gascony had rendered
him formidable to young chambermaids, and even sometimes their
mistresses, had never dreamed, even in moments of delirium, of half the
amorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here
set forth in connection with names the best known and with details the
least concealed. But if his morals were shocked on the landing, his
respect for the cardinal was scandalized in the antechamber. There, to
his great astonishment, dâ€™Artagnan heard the policy which made all
Europe tremble criticized aloud and openly, as well as the private life
of the cardinal, which so many great nobles had been punished for trying
to pry into. That great man who was so revered by dâ€™Artagnan the elder
served as an object of ridicule to the Musketeers of Treville, who
cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked back. Some sang
ballads about Mme. dâ€™Aguillon, his mistress, and Mme. Cambalet, his
niece; while others formed parties and plans to annoy the pages and
guards of the cardinal duke--all things which appeared to dâ€™Artagnan
monstrous impossibilities.
Nevertheless, when the name of the king was now and then uttered
unthinkingly amid all these cardinal jests, a sort of gag seemed to
close for a moment on all these jeering mouths. They looked hesitatingly
around them, and appeared to doubt the thickness of the partition
between them and the office of M. de Treville; but a fresh allusion soon
brought back the conversation to his Eminence, and then the laughter
recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from any of his
actions.
NA
the terrified dâ€™Artagnan, â€œand I, no doubt, with them; for from the
moment I have either listened to or heard them, I shall be held as an
accomplice. What would my good father say, who so strongly pointed out
to me the respect due to the cardinal, if he knew I was in the society
NA
We have no need, therefore, to say that dâ€™Artagnan dared not join in the
conversation, only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his
ears, stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing; and despite his
confidence on the paternal admonitions, he felt himself carried by his
tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the
unheard-of things which were taking place.
Although he was a perfect stranger in the court of M. de Trevilleâ€™s
courtiers, and this his first appearance in that place, he was at length
noticed, and somebody came and asked him what he wanted. At this demand
dâ€™Artagnan gave his name very modestly, emphasized the title of
compatriot, and begged the servant who had put the question to him to
request a momentâ€™s audience of M. de Treville--a request which the
other, with an air of protection, promised to transmit in due season.
Dâ€™Artagnan, a little recovered from his first surprise, had now leisure
to study costumes and physiognomy.
The center of the most animated group was a Musketeer of great height
and haughty countenance, dressed in a costume so peculiar as to attract
general attention. He did not wear the uniform cloak--which was not
obligatory at that epoch of less liberty but more independence--but a
cerulean-blue doublet, a little faded and worn, and over this a
magnificent baldric, worked in gold, which shone like water ripples in
the sun. A long cloak of crimson velvet fell in graceful folds from his
shoulders, disclosing in front the splendid baldric, from which was
suspended a gigantic rapier. This Musketeer had just come off guard,
complained of having a cold, and coughed from time to time affectedly.
It was for this reason, as he said to those around him, that he had put
on his cloak; and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his
mustache disdainfully, all admired his embroidered baldric, and
dâ€™Artagnan more than anyone.
NA
It is a folly, I admit, but still it is the fashion. Besides, one must
NA
NA
believe you obtained that baldric by paternal generosity. It was given
to you by that veiled lady I met you with the other Sunday, near the

NA
Porthos.
NA
NA
NA

The wonder was increased, though the doubt continued to exist.
NA
Musketeer.
This other Musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator, who
had just designated him by the name of Aramis. He was a stout man, of
about two- or three-and-twenty, with an open, ingenuous countenance, a
black, mild eye, and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn peach. His
delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip;
he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell,
and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their
delicate pink transparency. Habitually he spoke little and slowly, bowed
frequently, laughed without noise, showing his teeth, which were fine
and of which, as the rest of his person, he appeared to take great care.
He answered the appeal of his friend by an affirmative nod of the head.
This affirmation appeared to dispel all doubts with regard to the
baldric. They continued to admire it, but said no more about it; and
with a rapid change of thought, the conversation passed suddenly to
another subject.

contrary speaking to everybody.

of this spy and thanks to this correspondence, Chalaisâ€™s throat cut,
under the stupid pretext that he wanted to kill the king and marry
Monsieur to the queen! Nobody knew a word of this enigma. You unraveled
it yesterday to the great satisfaction of all; and while we are still

de Bois-Tracyâ€™s, the cousin of Madame de Chevreuse, and you pass for
being far advanced in the good graces of that lady. Oh, good Lord! Donâ€™t
trouble yourself to reveal your good luck; no one asks for your
secret-all the world knows your discretion. But since you possess that
virtue, why the devil donâ€™t you make use of it with respect to her
Majesty? Let whoever likes talk of the king and the cardinal, and how he

Musketeer; in that quality I say what I please, and at this moment it

throwing open the door of the cabinet.
At this announcement, during which the door remained open, everyone
became mute, and amid the general silence the young man crossed part of
the length of the antechamber, and entered the apartment of the captain
of the Musketeers, congratulating himself with all his heart at having
so narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel.
3 THE AUDIENCE
M de Treville was at the moment in rather ill-humor, nevertheless he
saluted the young man politely, who bowed to the very ground; and he
smiled on receiving dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s response, the Bearnese accent of which
recalled to him at the same time his youth and his country--a double
remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages; but stepping toward the
antechamber and making a sign to dâ€™Artagnan with his hand, as if to ask
his permission to finish with others before he began with him, he called
three times, with a louder voice at each time, so that he ran through
the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry
accent.
NA
The two Musketeers with whom we have already made acquaintance, and who
answered to the last of these three names, immediately quitted the group
of which they had formed a part, and advanced toward the cabinet, the
door of which closed after them as soon as they had entered. Their
appearance, although it was not quite at ease, excited by its
carelessness, at once full of dignity and submission, the admiration of
dâ€™Artagnan, who beheld in these two men demigods, and in their leader an
Olympian Jupiter, armed with all his thunders.
When the two Musketeers had entered; when the door was closed behind
them; when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber, to which the summons
which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food, had recommenced;
when M. de Treville had three or four times paced in silence, and with a
frowning brow, the whole length of his cabinet, passing each time before
Porthos and Aramis, who were as upright and silent as if on parade--he
stopped all at once full in front of them, and covering them from head
NA
cried he, â€œand that no longer ago than yesterday evening--do you know,
NA

his politest tone and with his most graceful bow.
â€œHe told me that he should henceforth recruit his Musketeers from among
NA
NA
â€œBecause he plainly perceives that his piquette* stands in need of being
NA
    _*A watered liquor, made from the second pressing of the grape._
The two Musketeers reddened to the whites of their eyes. Dâ€™Artagnan did
not know where he was, and wished himself a hundred feet underground.
NA
his majesty was right; for, upon my honor, it is true that the
Musketeers make but a miserable figure at court. The cardinal related
yesterday while playing with the king, with an air of condolence very
displeasing to me, that the day before yesterday those DAMNED
MUSKETEERS, those DAREDEVILS--he dwelt upon those words with an ironical
tone still more displeasing to me--those BRAGGARTS, added he, glancing
at me with his tiger-catâ€™s eye, had made a riot in the Rue Ferou in a
cabaret, and that a party of his Guards (I thought he was going to laugh
in my face) had been forced to arrest the rioters! MORBLEU! You must
know something about it. Arrest Musketeers! You were among them--you
were! Donâ€™t deny it; you were recognized, and the cardinal named you.
But itâ€™s all my fault; yes, itâ€™s all my fault, because it is myself who
selects my men. You, Aramis, why the devil did you ask me for a uniform
when you would have been so much better in a cassock? And you, Porthos,
do you only wear such a fine golden baldric to suspend a sword of straw

desirous of taking his turn in the conversation; â€œand what is serious is
NA
â€œThe smallpox! Thatâ€™s a great story to tell me, Porthos! Sick of the
smallpox at his age! No, no; but wounded without doubt, killed, perhaps.
Ah, if I knew! Sâ€™blood! Messieurs Musketeers, I will not have this
haunting of bad places, this quarreling in the streets, this swordplay
at the crossways; and above all, I will not have occasion given for the
cardinalâ€™s Guards, who are brave, quiet, skillful men who never put
themselves in a position to be arrested, and who, besides, never allow
themselves to be arrested, to laugh at you! I am sure of it--they would
prefer dying on the spot to being arrested or taking back a step. To
save yourselves, to scamper away, to flee--that is good for the kingâ€™s
NA
Porthos and Aramis trembled with rage. They could willingly have
strangled M. de Treville, if, at the bottom of all this, they had not
felt it was the great love he bore them which made him speak thus. They
stamped upon the carpet with their feet; they bit their lips till the
blood came, and grasped the hilts of their swords with all their might.
All without had heard, as we have said, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis
called, and had guessed, from M. de Trevilleâ€™s tone of voice, that he
was very angry about something. Ten curious heads were glued to the
tapestry and became pale with fury; for their ears, closely applied to
the door, did not lose a syllable of what he said, while their mouths
repeated as he went on, the insulting expressions of the captain to all
the people in the antechamber. In an instant, from the door of the
cabinet to the street gate, the whole hotel was boiling.
â€œAh! The kingâ€™s Musketeers are arrested by the Guards of the cardinal,
NA
soldiers, but emphasizing his words and plunging them, one by one, so to
say, like so many blows of a stiletto, into the bosoms of his auditors.
â€œWhat! Six of his Eminenceâ€™s Guards arrest six of his Majestyâ€™s
Musketeers! MORBLEU! My part is taken! I will go straight to the louvre;
I will give in my resignation as captain of the kingâ€™s Musketeers to
take a lieutenancy in the cardinalâ€™s Guards, and if he refuses me,

At these words, the murmur without became an explosion; nothing was to
be heard but oaths and blasphemies. The MORBLEUS, the SANG DIEUS, the
MORTS TOUTS LES DIABLES, crossed one another in the air. Dâ€™Artagnan
looked for some tapestry behind which he might hide himself, and felt an
immense inclination to crawl under the table.

that we were six against six. But we were not captured by fair means;
and before we had time to draw our swords, two of our party were dead,
and Athos, grievously wounded, was very little better. For you know
Athos. Well, Captain, he endeavored twice to get up, and fell again
twice. And we did not surrender--no! They dragged us away by force. On
the way we escaped. As for Athos, they believed him to be dead, and left
him very quiet on the field of battle, not thinking it worth the trouble
to carry him away. Thatâ€™s the whole story. What the devil, Captain, one
cannot win all oneâ€™s battles! The great Pompey lost that of Pharsalia;

me, and I have hastened to receive your orders. I am here; what do you

And at these words, the Musketeer, in irreproachable costume, belted as
usual, with a tolerably firm step, entered the cabinet. M. de Treville,
moved to the bottom of his heart by this proof of courage, sprang toward
him.
NA

to the king, and the king knows that his Musketeers are the bravest on
NA
And without waiting for the answer of the newcomer to this proof of
affection, M. de Treville seized his right hand and pressed it with all
his might, without perceiving that Athos, whatever might be his
self-command, allowed a slight murmur of pain to escape him, and if
possible, grew paler than he was before.
The door had remained open, so strong was the excitement produced by the
arrival of Athos, whose wound, though kept as a secret, was known to
all. A burst of satisfaction hailed the last words of the captain; and
two or three heads, carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment,
appeared through the openings of the tapestry. M. de Treville was about
to reprehend this breach of the rules of etiquette, when he felt the
hand of Athos, who had rallied all his energies to contend against pain,
at length overcome by it, fell upon the floor as if he were dead.
NA
NA
At the cries of M. de Treville, the whole assemblage rushed into the
cabinet, he not thinking to shut the door against anyone, and all
crowded round the wounded man. But all this eager attention might have
been useless if the doctor so loudly called for had not chanced to be in
the hotel. He pushed through the crowd, approached Athos, still
insensible, and as all this noise and commotion inconvenienced him
greatly, he required, as the first and most urgent thing, that the
Musketeer should be carried into an adjoining chamber. Immediately M. de
Treville opened and pointed the way to Porthos and Aramis, who bore
their comrade in their arms. Behind this group walked the surgeon; and
behind the surgeon the door closed.
The cabinet of M. de Treville, generally held so sacred, became in an
instant the annex of the antechamber. Everyone spoke, harangued, and
vociferated, swearing, cursing, and consigning the cardinal and his
Guards to all the devils.
An instant after, Porthos and Aramis re-entered, the surgeon and M. de
Treville alone remaining with the wounded.
At length, M. de Treville himself returned. The injured man had
recovered his senses. The surgeon declared that the situation of the
Musketeer had nothing in it to render his friends uneasy, his weakness
having been purely and simply caused by loss of blood.
Then M. de Treville made a sign with his hand, and all retired except
dâ€™Artagnan, who did not forget that he had an audience, and with the
tenacity of a Gascon remained in his place.
When all had gone out and the door was closed, M. de Treville, on
turning round, found himself alone with the young man. The event which
had occurred had in some degree broken the thread of his ideas. He
inquired what was the will of his persevering visitor. Dâ€™Artagnan then
repeated his name, and in an instant recovering all his remembrances of
the present and the past, M. de Treville grasped the situation.

nothing but a father of a family, charged with even a greater
responsibility than the father of an ordinary family. Soldiers are big

Dâ€™Artagnan could not restrain a smile. By this smile M. de Treville
judged that he had not to deal with a fool, and changing the
conversation, came straight to the point.

which you have not forgotten, the uniform of a Musketeer; but after all

to believe. But his majestyâ€™s decision is always necessary; and I inform
you with regret that no one becomes a Musketeer without the preliminary

Dâ€™Artagnan bowed without replying, feeling his desire to don the
Musketeerâ€™s uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which
preceded the attainment of it.
NA
piercing that it might be said he wished to read the thoughts of his
heart, â€œon account of my old companion, your father, as I have said, I
will do something for you, young man. Our recruits from Bearn are not
generally very rich, and I have no reason to think matters have much
changed in this respect since I left the province. I dare say you have

Dâ€™Artagnan drew himself up with a proud air which plainly said, â€œI ask
NA
NA

my purse, and would have fought with anyone who dared to tell me I was

Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s bearing became still more imposing. Thanks to the sale of
his horse, he commenced his career with four more crowns than M. de
Treville possessed at the commencement of his.
â€œYou ought, I say, then, to husband the means you have, however large
the sum may be; but you ought also to endeavor to perfect yourself in
the exercises becoming a gentleman. I will write a letter today to the
Director of the Royal Academy, and tomorrow he will admit you without
any expense to yourself. Do not refuse this little service. Our
best-born and richest gentlemen sometimes solicit it without being able
to obtain it. You will learn horsemanship, swordsmanship in all its
branches, and dancing. You will make some desirable acquaintances; and
from time to time you can call upon me, just to tell me how you are

Dâ€™Artagnan, stranger as he was to all the manners of a court, could not
but perceive a little coldness in this reception.

He then related the adventure of Meung, described the unknown gentleman
with the greatest minuteness, and all with a warmth and truthfulness
that delighted M. de Treville.
NA
NA
â€œYes, sir, I certainly committed that imprudence; but why should I have
done otherwise? A name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my way.
NA
Flattery was at that period very current, and M. de Treville loved
incense as well as a king, or even a cardinal. He could not refrain from
a smile of visible satisfaction; but this smile soon disappeared, and
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, yes, that is he; how is it, sir, that you are acquainted with this
man? If I ever find him again--and I will find him, I swear, were it in

NA
NA
NA
All at once the captain stopped, as if struck by a sudden suspicion.
This great hatred which the young traveler manifested so loudly for this
man, who--a rather improbable thing--had stolen his fatherâ€™s letter from
him--was there not some perfidy concealed under this hatred? Might not
this young man be sent by his Eminence? Might he not have come for the
purpose of laying a snare for him? This pretended dâ€™Artagnan--was he not
an emissary of the cardinal, whom the cardinal sought to introduce into
Trevilleâ€™s house, to place near him, to win his confidence, and
afterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances? He
fixed his eyes upon dâ€™Artagnan even more earnestly than before. He was
moderately reassured, however, by the aspect of that countenance, full
NA
reflected he, â€œbut he may be one for the cardinal as well as for me. Let
NA
NA
friend--for I consider this story of the lost letter perfectly true--I
wish, I say, in order to repair the coldness you may have remarked in my
reception of you, to discover to you the secrets of our policy. The king
and the cardinal are the best of friends; their apparent bickerings are
only feints to deceive fools. I am not willing that a compatriot, a
handsome cavalier, a brave youth, quite fit to make his way, should
become the dupe of all these artifices and fall into the snare after the
example of so many others who have been ruined by it. Be assured that I
am devoted to both these all-powerful masters, and that my earnest
endeavors have no other aim than the service of the king, and also the
cardinal--one of the most illustrious geniuses that France has ever
produced.
â€œNow, young man, regulate your conduct accordingly; and if you
entertain, whether from your family, your relations, or even from your
instincts, any of these enmities which we see constantly breaking out
against the cardinal, bid me adieu and let us separate. I will aid you
in many ways, but without attaching you to my person. I hope that my
frankness at least will make you my friend; for you are the only young

Treville said to himself: â€œIf the cardinal has set this young fox upon
me, he will certainly not have failed--he, who knows how bitterly I
execrate him--to tell his spy that the best means of making his court to
me is to rail at him. Therefore, in spite of all my protestations, if it
be as I suspect, my cunning gossip will assure me that he holds his

It, however, proved otherwise. Dâ€™Artagnan answered, with the greatest
simplicity: â€œI came to Paris with exactly such intentions. My father
advised me to stoop to nobody but the king, the cardinal, and

Dâ€™Artagnan added M. de Treville to the others, as may be perceived; but
he thought this addition would do no harm.

sir, if you speak to me, as you say, with frankness--for then you will
do me the honor to esteem the resemblance of our opinions; but if you
have entertained any doubt, as naturally you may, I feel that I am
ruining myself by speaking the truth. But I still trust you will not

M de Treville was surprised to the greatest degree. So much penetration,
so much frankness, created admiration, but did not entirely remove his
suspicions. The more this young man was superior to others, the more he
was to be dreaded if he meant to deceive him. Nevertheless, he pressed
dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s hand, and said to him: â€œYou are an honest youth; but at the
present moment I can only do for you that which I just now offered. My
hotel will be always open to you. Hereafter, being able to ask for me at
all hours, and consequently to take advantage of all opportunities, you

M de Treville smiled at this flourish; and leaving his young man
compatriot in the embrasure of the window, where they had talked
together, he seated himself at a table in order to write the promised
letter of recommendation. While he was doing this, dâ€™Artagnan, having no
better employment, amused himself with beating a march upon the window
and with looking at the Musketeers, who went away, one after another,
following them with his eyes until they disappeared.
M de Treville, after having written the letter, sealed it, and rising,
approached the young man in order to give it to him. But at the very
moment when dâ€™Artagnan stretched out his hand to receive it, M. de
Treville was highly astonished to see his protege make a sudden spring,
become crimson with passion, and rush from the cabinet crying, â€œSâ€™blood,

4 THE SHOULDER OF ATHOS, THE BALDRIC OF PORTHOS AND THE HANDKERCHIEF OF
ARAMIS
Dâ€™Artagnan, in a state of fury, crossed the antechamber at three bounds,
and was darting toward the stairs, which he reckoned upon descending
four at a time, when, in his heedless course, he ran head foremost
against a Musketeer who was coming out of one of M. de Trevilleâ€™s
private rooms, and striking his shoulder violently, made him utter a
cry, or rather a howl.
NA
NA
Scarcely had he descended the first stair, when a hand of iron seized
him by the belt and stopped him.
NA
that pretense you run against me! You say, â€˜Excuse me,â€™ and you believe
that is sufficient? Not at all, my young man. Do you fancy because you

that other people are to treat us as he speaks to us? Undeceive

did not do it intentionally, and not doing it intentionally, I said
â€˜Excuse me.â€™ It appears to me that this is quite enough. I repeat to
you, however, and this time on my word of honor--I think perhaps too
often--that I am in haste, great haste. Leave your hold, then, I beg of

NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan had already strode down three or four stairs, but at Athosâ€™s
last remark he stopped short.
NA
NA
NA
â€œAh! If I were not in such haste, and if I were not running after
NA
â€œMonsieur Man-in-a-hurry, you can find me without running--ME, you
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œEndeavor not to make me wait; for at quarter past twelve I will cut off
NA
NA
And he set off running as if the devil possessed him, hoping that he
might yet find the stranger, whose slow pace could not have carried him
far.
But at the street gate, Porthos was talking with the soldier on guard.
Between the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to pass.
Dâ€™Artagnan thought it would suffice for him, and he sprang forward like
a dart between them. But dâ€™Artagnan had reckoned without the wind. As he
was about to pass, the wind blew out Porthosâ€™s long cloak, and
dâ€™Artagnan rushed straight into the middle of it. Without doubt, Porthos
had reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments, for instead
of quitting his hold on the flap in his hand, he pulled it toward him,
so that dâ€™Artagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by a movement of
rotation explained by the persistency of Porthos.
Dâ€™Artagnan, hearing the Musketeer swear, wished to escape from the
cloak, which blinded him, and sought to find his way from under the
folds of it. He was particularly anxious to avoid marring the freshness
of the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with; but on timidly
opening his eyes, he found himself with his nose fixed between the two
shoulders of Porthos--that is to say, exactly upon the baldric.
Alas, like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor
but appearances, the baldric was glittering with gold in the front, but
was nothing but simple buff behind. Vainglorious as he was, Porthos
could not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold, but had at least
half. One could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of
the cloak.

And the young man, delighted with his joke, went away laughing loudly.
Porthos foamed with rage, and made a movement to rush after dâ€™Artagnan.

NA
of the street.
But neither in the street he had passed through, nor in the one which
his eager glance pervaded, could he see anyone; however slowly the
stranger had walked, he was gone on his way, or perhaps had entered some
house. Dâ€™Artagnan inquired of everyone he met with, went down to the
ferry, came up again by the Rue de Seine, and the Red Cross; but
nothing, absolutely nothing! This chase was, however, advantageous to
him in one sense, for in proportion as the perspiration broke from his
forehead, his heart began to cool.
He began to reflect upon the events that had passed; they were numerous
and inauspicious. It was scarcely eleven oâ€™clock in the morning, and yet
this morning had already brought him into disgrace with M. de Treville,
who could not fail to think the manner in which dâ€™Artagnan had left him
a little cavalier.
Besides this, he had drawn upon himself two good duels with two men,
each capable of killing three dâ€™Artagnans--with two Musketeers, in
short, with two of those beings whom he esteemed so greatly that he
placed them in his mind and heart above all other men.
The outlook was sad. Sure of being killed by Athos, it may easily be
understood that the young man was not very uneasy about Porthos. As
hope, however, is the last thing extinguished in the heart of man, he
finished by hoping that he might survive, even though with terrible
wounds, in both these duels; and in case of surviving, he made the
following reprehensions upon his own conduct:
â€œWhat a madcap I was, and what a stupid fellow I am! That brave and
unfortunate Athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which I must
run head foremost, like a ram. The only thing that astonishes me is that
he did not strike me dead at once. He had good cause to do so; the pain
I gave him must have been atrocious. As to Porthos--oh, as to Porthos,
NA
And in spite of himself, the young man began to laugh aloud, looking
round carefully, however, to see that his solitary laugh, without a
cause in the eyes of passers-by, offended no one.
â€œAs to Porthos, that is certainly droll; but I am not the less a giddy
fool. Are people to be run against without warning? No! And have I any
right to go and peep under their cloaks to see what is not there? He
would have pardoned me, he would certainly have pardoned me, if I had
not said anything to him about that cursed baldric--in ambiguous words,
it is true, but rather drolly ambiguous. Ah, cursed Gascon that I am, I

speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself,
â€œif you escape, of which there is not much chance, I would advise you to
practice perfect politeness for the future. You must henceforth be
admired and quoted as a model of it. To be obliging and polite does not
necessarily make a man a coward. Look at Aramis, now; Aramis is mildness
and grace personified. Well, did anybody ever dream of calling Aramis a
coward? No, certainly not, and from this moment I will endeavor to model
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan, walking and soliloquizing, had arrived within a few steps of
the hotel dâ€™Arguillon and in front of that hotel perceived Aramis,
chatting gaily with three gentlemen; but as he had not forgotten that it
was in presence of this young man that M. de Treville had been so angry
in the morning, and as a witness of the rebuke the Musketeers had
received was not likely to be at all agreeable, he pretended not to see
him. Dâ€™Artagnan, on the contrary, quite full of his plans of
conciliation and courtesy, approached the young men with a profound bow,
accompanied by a most gracious smile. All four, besides, immediately
broke off their conversation.
Dâ€™Artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many;
but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to
know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position, like that
of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with
and in a conversation that does not concern him. He was seeking in his
mind, then, for the least awkward means of retreat, when he remarked
that Aramis had let his handkerchief fall, and by mistake, no doubt, had
placed his foot upon it. This appeared to be a favorable opportunity to
repair his intrusion. He stooped, and with the most gracious air he
could assume, drew the handkerchief from under the foot of the Musketeer
in spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it, and holding it out
to him, said, â€œI believe, monsieur, that this is a handkerchief you

The handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered, and had a coronet and
arms at one of its corners. Aramis blushed excessively, and snatched
rather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the Gascon.

Bois-Tracy, when that gracious lady has the kindness to lend you one of

Aramis darted at dâ€™Artagnan one of those looks which inform a man that
he has acquired a mortal enemy. Then, resuming his mild air, â€œYou are

So saying, he pulled out his own handkerchief, likewise a very elegant
handkerchief, and of fine cambric--though cambric was dear at the
period--but a handkerchief without embroidery and without arms, only
ornamented with a single cipher, that of its proprietor.
This time dâ€™Artagnan was not hasty. He perceived his mistake; but the
friends of Aramis were not at all convinced by his denial, and one of
them addressed the young Musketeer with affected seriousness. â€œIf it

will be pretty evident that one of us will have lied. Now, here,

The young men burst into a laugh, and as may be supposed, the affair had
no other sequel. In a moment or two the conversation ceased, and the

loudly than his pacific resolutions. â€œI am from Gascony, it is true; and
since you know it, there is no occasion to tell you that Gascons are not
very patient, so that when they have begged to be excused once, were it
even for a folly, they are convinced that they have done already at

The two young men bowed and separated, Aramis ascending the street which
led to the Luxembourg, while dâ€™Artagnan, perceiving the appointed hour
was approaching, took the road to the Carmes-Deschaux, saying to

5 THE KINGâ€™S MUSKETEERS AND THE CARDINALâ€™S GUARDS
Dâ€™Artagnan was acquainted with nobody in Paris. He went therefore to his
appointment with Athos without a second, determined to be satisfied with
those his adversary should choose. Besides, his intention was formed to
make the brave Musketeer all suitable apologies, but without meanness or
weakness, fearing that might result from this duel which generally
results from an affair of this kind, when a young and vigorous man
fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakened--if conquered, he
doubles the triumph of his antagonist; if a conqueror, he is accused of
foul play and want of courage.
Now, we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker,
or our readers must have already perceived that dâ€™Artagnan was not an
ordinary man; therefore, while repeating to himself that his death was
inevitable, he did not make up his mind to die quietly, as one less
courageous and less restrained might have done in his place. He
reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going
to fight, and began to view his situation more clearly. He hoped, by
means of loyal excuses, to make a friend of Athos, whose lordly air and
austere bearing pleased him much. He flattered himself he should be able
to frighten Porthos with the adventure of the baldric, which he might,
if not killed upon the spot, relate to everybody a recital which, well
managed, would cover Porthos with ridicule. As to the astute Aramis, he
did not entertain much dread of him; and supposing he should be able to
get so far, he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least, by
hitting him in the face, as Caesar recommended his soldiers do to those
of Pompey, to damage forever the beauty of which he was so proud.
In addition to this, dâ€™Artagnan possessed that invincible stock of
resolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart:
â€œEndure nothing from anyone but the king, the cardinal, and Monsieur de
NA
Carmes Dechausses, or rather Deschaux, as it was called at that period,
a sort of building without a window, surrounded by barren fields--an
accessory to the Preaux-Clercs, and which was generally employed as the
place for the duels of men who had no time to lose.
When dâ€™Artagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which
extended along the foot of the monastery, Athos had been waiting about
five minutes, and twelve oâ€™clock was striking. He was, then, as punctual
as the Samaritan woman, and the most rigorous casuist with regard to
duels could have nothing to say.
Athos, who still suffered grievously from his wound, though it had been
dressed anew by M. de Trevilleâ€™s surgeon, was seated on a post and
waiting for his adversary with hat in hand, his feather even touching
the ground.

circumstances. Do not fancy that I do you a favor; I use either hand
easily. And it will be even a disadvantage to you; a left-handed man is
very troublesome to people who are not prepared for it. I regret I did

courtesy, without throwing the least doubt upon his courage.
NA
not that I can accept it, but a league off it savors of the gentleman.
Thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of the time of Charlemagne, in
whom every cavalier ought to seek his model. Unfortunately, we do not

cardinal; and three days hence, however well the secret might be

donâ€™t kill each other, I shall hereafter have much pleasure in your
conversation. We will wait for these gentlemen, so please you; I have
plenty of time, and it will be more correct. Ah, here is one of them, I

In fact, at the end of the Rue Vaugirard the gigantic Porthos appeared.

Dâ€™Artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by Athos, and perceived

Athos, whose keen eye lost nothing, perceived a faintly sly smile pass
over the lips of the young Gascon as he replied, â€œWe had a short

Athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of dâ€™Artagnan.

bright ray of the sun. â€œI asked to be excused in case I should not be
able to discharge my debt to all three; for Monsieur Athos has the right

Monsieur Porthos, and render yours almost null, Monsieur Aramis. And

At these words, with the most gallant air possible, dâ€™Artagnan drew his
sword.
The blood had mounted to the head of dâ€™Artagnan, and at that moment he
would have drawn his sword against all the Musketeers in the kingdom as
willingly as he now did against Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.
It was a quarter past midday. The sun was in its zenith, and the spot
chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ardor.

again, and I should not like to annoy Monsieur with the sight of blood

NA
NA
NA
NA
interrupted Aramis. â€œFor my part, I think what they say is very well
NA
NA
NA
But scarcely had the two rapiers clashed, when a company of the Guards
of his Eminence, commanded by M. de Jussac, turned the corner of the
convent.
NA
NA
But it was too late. The two combatants had been seen in a position
which left no doubt of their intentions.
NA
men to do so likewise, â€œhalloo, Musketeers? Fighting here, are you? And
NA
NA
rancor, for Jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding day. â€œIf
we were to see you fighting, I can assure you that we would make no
effort to prevent you. Leave us alone, then, and you will enjoy a little

but unfortunately the thing is impossible--Monsieur de Treville has

NA
Athos, Porthos, and Aramis instantly drew near one another, while Jussac
drew up his soldiers.
This short interval was sufficient to determine dâ€™Artagnan on the part
he was to take. It was one of those events which decide the life of a
man; it was a choice between the king and the cardinal--the choice made,
it must be persisted in. To fight, that was to disobey the law, that was
to risk his head, that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister
more powerful than the king himself. All this the young man perceived,
and yet, to his praise we speak it, he did not hesitate a second.

to correct your words, if you please. You said you were but three, but

NA
NA
NA
But all three reflected upon the youth of dâ€™Artagnan, and dreaded his
inexperience.
â€œWe should only be three, one of whom is wounded, with the addition of a

NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan comprehended their irresolution.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Athos.
NA
NA
NA
NA
lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the other.
NA
NA
And the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however
did not exclude a certain degree of method.
Athos fixed upon a certain Cahusac, a favorite of the cardinalâ€™s.
Porthos had Bicarat, and Aramis found himself opposed to two
adversaries. As to dâ€™Artagnan, he sprang toward Jussac himself.
The heart of the young Gascon beat as if it would burst through his
side--not from fear, God be thanked, he had not the shade of it, but
with emulation; he fought like a furious tiger, turning ten times round
his adversary, and changing his ground and his guard twenty times.
Jussac was, as was then said, a fine blade, and had had much practice;
nevertheless it required all his skill to defend himself against an
adversary who, active and energetic, departed every instant from
received rules, attacking him on all sides at once, and yet parrying
like a man who had the greatest respect for his own epidermis.
This contest at length exhausted Jussacâ€™s patience. Furious at being
held in check by one whom he had considered a boy, he became warm and
began to make mistakes. Dâ€™Artagnan, who though wanting in practice had a
sound theory, redoubled his agility. Jussac, anxious to put an end to
this, springing forward, aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary, but
the latter parried it; and while Jussac was recovering himself, glided
like a serpent beneath his blade, and passed his sword through his body.
Jussac fell like a dead mass.
Dâ€™Artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of
battle.
Aramis had killed one of his adversaries, but the other pressed him
warmly. Nevertheless, Aramis was in a good situation, and able to defend
himself.
Bicarat and Porthos had just made counterhits. Porthos had received a
thrust through his arm, and Bicarat one through his thigh. But neither
of these two wounds was serious, and they only fought more earnestly.
Athos, wounded anew by Cahusac, became evidently paler, but did not give
way a foot. He only changed his sword hand, and fought with his left
hand.
According to the laws of dueling at that period, dâ€™Artagnan was at
liberty to assist whom he pleased. While he was endeavoring to find out
which of his companions stood in greatest need, he caught a glance from
Athos. The glance was of sublime eloquence. Athos would have died rather
than appeal for help; but he could look, and with that look ask
assistance. Dâ€™Artagnan interpreted it; with a terrible bound he sprang
to the side of Cahusac, crying, â€œTo me, Monsieur Guardsman; I will slay
NA
Cahusac turned. It was time; for Athos, whose great courage alone
supported him, sank upon his knee.
NA
you. I have an old affair to settle with him when I am cured and sound
again. Disarm him only--make sure of his sword. Thatâ€™s it! Very well
NA
The exclamation was drawn from Athos by seeing the sword of Cahusac fly
twenty paces from him. Dâ€™Artagnan and Cahusac sprang forward at the same
instant, the one to recover, the other to obtain, the sword; but
dâ€™Artagnan, being the more active, reached it first and placed his foot
upon it.
Cahusac immediately ran to the Guardsman whom Aramis had killed, seized
his rapier, and returned toward dâ€™Artagnan; but on his way he met Athos,
who during his relief which dâ€™Artagnan had procured him had recovered
his breath, and who, for fear that dâ€™Artagnan would kill his enemy,
wished to resume the fight.
Dâ€™Artagnan perceived that it would be disobliging Athos not to leave him
alone; and in a few minutes Cahusac fell, with a sword thrust through
his throat.
At the same instant Aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his
fallen enemy, and forced him to ask for mercy.
There only then remained Porthos and Bicarat. Porthos made a thousand
flourishes, asking Bicarat what oâ€™clock it could be, and offering him
his compliments upon his brotherâ€™s having just obtained a company in the
regiment of Navarre; but, jest as he might, he gained nothing. Bicarat
was one of those iron men who never fell dead.
Nevertheless, it was necessary to finish. The watch might come up and
take all the combatants, wounded or not, royalists or cardinalists.
Athos, Aramis, and dâ€™Artagnan surrounded Bicarat, and required him to
surrender. Though alone against all and with a wound in his thigh,
Bicarat wished to hold out; but Jussac, who had risen upon his elbow,
cried out to him to yield. Bicarat was a Gascon, as dâ€™Artagnan was; he
turned a deaf ear, and contented himself with laughing, and between two

cried he, parodying a verse of the Bible, â€œhere will Bicarat die; for I
NA
NA
NA
NA
his sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering it,
threw the pieces over the convent wall, and crossed him arms, whistling
a cardinalist air.
Bravery is always respected, even in an enemy. The Musketeers saluted
Bicarat with their swords, and returned them to their sheaths.
Dâ€™Artagnan did the same. Then, assisted by Bicarat, the only one left
standing, they bore Jussac, Cahusac, and one of Aramisâ€™s adversaries who
was only wounded, under the porch of the convent. The fourth, as we have
said, was dead. They then rang the bell, and carrying away four swords
out of five, they took their road, intoxicated with joy, toward the
hotel of M. de Treville.
They walked arm in arm, occupying the whole width of the street and
taking in every Musketeer they met, so that in the end it became a
triumphal march. The heart of dâ€™Artagnan swam in delirium; he marched
between Athos and Porthos, pressing them tenderly.

6 HIS MAJESTY KING LOUIS XIII
This affair made a great noise. M. de Treville scolded his Musketeers in
public, and congratulated them in private; but as no time was to be lost
in gaining the king, M. de Treville hastened to report himself at the
Louvre. It was already too late. The king was closeted with the
cardinal, and M. de Treville was informed that the king was busy and
could not receive him at that moment. In the evening M. de Treville
attended the kingâ€™s gaming table. The king was winning; and as he was
very avaricious, he was in an excellent humor. Perceiving M. de Treville
at a distance--
NA
you. Do you know that his Eminence has been making fresh complaints
against your Musketeers, and that with so much emotion, that this
evening his Eminence is indisposed? Ah, these Musketeers of yours are

NA
would go, â€œon the contrary, they are good creatures, as meek as lambs,
and have but one desire, Iâ€™ll be their warranty. And that is that their
swords may never leave their scabbards but in your majestyâ€™s service.
But what are they to do? The Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal are forever
seeking quarrels with them, and for the honor of the corps even, the

NA
not one say he was speaking of a religious community? In truth, my dear
Captain, I have a great mind to take away your commission and give it to
Mademoiselle de Chemerault, to whom I promised an abbey. But donâ€™t fancy
that I am going to take you on your bare word. I am called Louis the
NA
â€œAh, sire; it is because I confide in that justice that I shall wait

NA
NA
In fact, fortune changed; and as the king began to lose what he had won,
he was not sorry to find an excuse for playing Charlemagne--if we may
use a gaming phrase of whose origin we confess our ignorance. The king
therefore arose a minute after, and putting the money which lay before
him into his pocket, the major part of which arose from his winnings,

put down the same sum, so that they who have lost may have nothing to

Then turning toward M. de Treville and walking with him toward the
NA
NA
NA
â€œAnd how did the thing happen? Let us see, for you know, my dear
NA
â€œGood Lord! In the most simple and natural manner possible. Three of my
best soldiers, whom your Majesty knows by name, and whose devotedness
you have more than once appreciated, and who have, I dare affirm to the
king, his service much at heart--three of my best soldiers, I say,
Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, had made a party of pleasure with a young
fellow from Gascony, whom I had introduced to them the same morning. The
party was to take place at St. Germain, I believe, and they had
appointed to meet at the Carmes-Deschaux, when they were disturbed by de
Jussac, Cahusac, Bicarat, and two other Guardsmen, who certainly did not
go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against

NA
NA
â€œI do not accuse them, sire; but I leave your Majesty to judge what five
armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place as the

NA
â€œThen, upon seeing my Musketeers they changed their minds, and forgot
their private hatred for partisan hatred; for your Majesty cannot be
ignorant that the Musketeers, who belong to the king and nobody but the
king, are the natural enemies of the Guardsmen, who belong to the

royalty. But all this will come to an end, Treville, will come to an
end. You say, then, that the Guardsmen sought a quarrel with the

â€œI say that it is probable that things have fallen out so, but I will
not swear to it, sire. You know how difficult it is to discover the
truth; and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which

NA
â€œYes, sire, and one wounded man; so that three of the kingâ€™s
Musketeers--one of whom was wounded--and a youth not only maintained
their ground against five of the most terrible of the cardinalâ€™s

NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œOne hardly a young man; but who, however, behaved himself so admirably
on this occasion that I will take the liberty of recommending him to

NA

a man who served under the king your father, of glorious memory, in the

And Louis XIII twisted his mustache proudly, placing his hand upon his
hip.

more than a boy; and as he has not the honor of being a Musketeer, he
was dressed as a citizen. The Guards of the cardinal, perceiving his
youth and that he did not belong to the corps, invited him to retire
NA
NA
NA
â€œThat is true, sire; there can be no more doubt on that head. They
called upon him then to retire; but he answered that he was a Musketeer
at heart, entirely devoted to your Majesty, and that therefore he would

NA
â€œWell, he did remain with them; and your Majesty has in him so firm a
champion that it was he who gave Jussac the terrible sword thrust which

â€œI will see this young man, Treville--I will see him; and if anything

NA
NA

â€œNo, bring me all four together. I wish to thank them all at once.
Devoted men are so rare, Treville, by the back staircase. It is useless

NA
â€œYou understand, Treville--an edict is still an edict, it is forbidden
NA
â€œBut this encounter, sire, is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a
duel. It is a brawl; and the proof is that there were five of the
cardinalâ€™s Guardsmen against my three Musketeers and Monsieur
NA
NA
NA
Treville smiled; but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon
this child to rebel against his master, he saluted the king
respectfully, and with this agreement, took leave of him.
That evening the three Musketeers were informed of the honor accorded
them. As they had long been acquainted with the king, they were not much
excited; but dâ€™Artagnan, with his Gascon imagination, saw in it his
future fortune, and passed the night in golden dreams. By eight oâ€™clock
in the morning he was at the apartment of Athos.
Dâ€™Artagnan found the Musketeer dressed and ready to go out. As the hour
to wait upon the king was not till twelve, he had made a party with
Porthos and Aramis to play a game at tennis in a tennis court situated
near the stables of the Luxembourg. Athos invited dâ€™Artagnan to follow
them; and although ignorant of the game, which he had never played, he
accepted, not knowing what to do with his time from nine oâ€™clock in the
morning, as it then scarcely was, till twelve.
The two Musketeers were already there, and were playing together. Athos,
who was very expert in all bodily exercises, passed with dâ€™Artagnan to
the opposite side and challenged them; but at the first effort he made,
although he played with his left hand, he found that his wound was yet
too recent to allow of such exertion. Dâ€™Artagnan remained, therefore,
alone; and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it
regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without
counting. But one of these balls, launched by Porthosâ€™ herculean hand,
passed so close to dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s face that he thought that if, instead of
passing near, it had hit him, his audience would have been probably
lost, as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before
the king. Now, as upon this audience, in his Gascon imagination,
depended his future life, he saluted Aramis and Porthos politely,
declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared
to play with them on more equal terms, and went and took his place near
the cord and in the gallery.
Unfortunately for dâ€™Artagnan, among the spectators was one of his
Eminenceâ€™s Guardsmen, who, still irritated by the defeat of his
companions, which had happened only the day before, had promised himself
to seize the first opportunity of avenging it. He believed this
opportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor: â€œIt is not
astonishing that that young man should be afraid of a ball, for he is
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan turned round as if a serpent had stung him, and fixed his
eyes intensely upon the Guardsman who had just made this insolent
speech.
NA
NA
â€œAnd as since that which you have said is too clear to require any

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYouâ€™re in the wrong there; for if you knew my name, perhaps you would

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œDo not hurry yourself, monsieur, lest it be observed that we go out
together. You must be aware that for our undertaking, company would be

NA
produced more effect upon the young man.
Indeed, the name of Bernajoux was known to all the world, dâ€™Artagnan
alone excepted, perhaps; for it was one of those which figured most
frequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal
could not repress.
Porthos and Aramis were so engaged with their game, and Athos was
watching them with so much attention, that they did not even perceive
their young companion go out, who, as he had told the Guardsman of his
Eminence, stopped outside the door. An instant after, the Guardsman
descended in his turn. As dâ€™Artagnan had no time to lose, on account of
the audience of the king, which was fixed for midday, he cast his eyes
around, and seeing that the street was empty, said to his adversary, â€œMy
faith! It is fortunate for you, although your name is Bernajoux, to have
only to deal with an apprentice Musketeer. Never mind; be content, I
NA
NA
this place is badly chosen, and that we should be better behind the

NA
I have very little time to spare, having an appointment at twelve
NA
Bernajoux was not a man to have such a compliment paid to him twice. In
an instant his sword glittered in his hand, and he sprang upon his
adversary, whom, thanks to his great youthfulness, he hoped to
intimidate.
But dâ€™Artagnan had on the preceding day served his apprenticeship. Fresh
sharpened by his victory, full of hopes of future favor, he was resolved
not to recoil a step. So the two swords were crossed close to the hilts,
and as dâ€™Artagnan stood firm, it was his adversary who made the
retreating step; but dâ€™Artagnan seized the moment at which, in this
movement, the sword of Bernajoux deviated from the line. He freed his
weapon, made a lunge, and touched his adversary on the shoulder.
Dâ€™Artagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword; but
Bernajoux cried out that it was nothing, and rushing blindly upon him,
absolutely spitted himself upon dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s sword. As, however, he did
not fall, as he did not declare himself conquered, but only broke away
toward the hotel of M. de la Tremouille, in whose service he had a
relative, dâ€™Artagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of the last wound
his adversary had received, and pressing him warmly, without doubt would
soon have completed his work with a third blow, when the noise which
arose from the street being heard in the tennis court, two of the
friends of the Guardsman, who had seen him go out after exchanging some
words with dâ€™Artagnan, rushed, sword in hand, from the court, and fell
upon the conqueror. But Athos, Porthos, and Aramis quickly appeared in
their turn, and the moment the two Guardsmen attacked their young
companion, drove them back. Bernajoux now fell, and as the Guardsmen
were only two against four, they began to cry, â€œTo the rescue! The Hotel
NA
and fell upon the four companions, who on their side cried aloud, â€œTo

This cry was generally heeded; for the Musketeers were known to be
enemies of the cardinal, and were beloved on account of the hatred they
bore to his Eminence. Thus the soldiers of other companies than those
which belonged to the Red Duke, as Aramis had called him, often took
part with the kingâ€™s Musketeers in these quarrels. Of three Guardsmen of
the company of M. Dessessart who were passing, two came to the
assistance of the four companions, while the other ran toward the hotel
NA
As usual, this hotel was full of soldiers of this company, who hastened
to the succor of their comrades. The MELEE became general, but strength
was on the side of the Musketeers. The cardinalâ€™s Guards and M. de la
Tremouilleâ€™s people retreated into the hotel, the doors of which they
closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with them. As
to the wounded man, he had been taken in at once, and, as we have said,
in a very bad state.
Excitement was at its height among the Musketeers and their allies, and
they even began to deliberate whether they should not set fire to the
hotel to punish the insolence of M. de la Tremouilleâ€™s domestics in
daring to make a SORTIE upon the kingâ€™s Musketeers. The proposition had
been made, and received with enthusiasm, when fortunately eleven oâ€™clock
struck. Dâ€™Artagnan and his companions remembered their audience, and as
they would very much have regretted that such an opportunity should be
lost, they succeeded in calming their friends, who contented themselves
with hurling some paving stones against the gates; but the gates were
too strong. They soon tired of the sport. Besides, those who must be
considered the leaders of the enterprise had quit the group and were
making their way toward the hotel of M. de Treville, who was waiting for
them, already informed of this fresh disturbance.
NA
instant, and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by
the cardinal. We will describe the thing to him as a consequence of the

M de Treville, accompanied by the four young fellows, directed his
course toward the Louvre; but to the great astonishment of the captain
of the Musketeers, he was informed that the king had gone stag hunting
in the forest of St. Germain. M. de Treville required this intelligence
to be repeated to him twice, and each time his companions saw his brow
become darker.
NA
NA
NA
Hounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down a stag.
At first the king answered that he would not go; but he could not resist

NA

NA

the king this evening; but as to you, I do not advise you to risk doing
NA
This advice was too reasonable, and moreover came from a man who knew
the king too well, to allow the four young men to dispute it. M. de
Treville recommended everyone to return home and wait for news.
On entering his hotel, M. de Treville thought it best to be first in
making the complaint. He sent one of his servants to M. de la Tremouille
with a letter in which he begged of him to eject the cardinalâ€™s
Guardsmen from his house, and to reprimand his people for their audacity
in making SORTIE against the kingâ€™s Musketeers. But M. de la
Tremouille--already prejudiced by his esquire, whose relative, as we
already know, Bernajoux was--replied that it was neither for M. de
Treville nor the Musketeers to complain, but, on the contrary, for him,
whose people the Musketeers had assaulted and whose hotel they had
endeavored to burn. Now, as the debate between these two nobles might
last a long time, each becoming, naturally, more firm in his own
opinion, M. de Treville thought of an expedient which might terminate it
quietly. This was to go himself to M. de la Tremouille.
He repaired, therefore, immediately to his hotel, and caused himself to
be announced.
The two nobles saluted each other politely, for if no friendship existed
between them, there was at least esteem. Both were men of courage and
honor; and as M. de la Tremouille--a Protestant, and seeing the king
seldom--was of no party, he did not, in general, carry any bias into his
social relations. This time, however, his address, although polite, was
cooler than usual.
NA
complain of the other, and I am come to endeavor to clear up this

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhy, monsieur, very ill indeed! In addition to the sword thrust in his
arm, which is not dangerous, he has received another right through his

NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, monsieur, let us go to him. Let us adjure him, in the name of the
God before whom he must perhaps appear, to speak the truth. I will take
him for judge in his own cause, monsieur, and will believe what he will
NA
M de la Tremouille reflected for an instant; then as it was difficult to
suggest a more reasonable proposal, he agreed to it.
Both descended to the chamber in which the wounded man lay. The latter,
on seeing these two noble lords who came to visit him, endeavored to
raise himself up in his bed; but he was too weak, and exhausted by the
effort, he fell back again almost senseless.
M de la Tremouille approached him, and made him inhale some salts, which
recalled him to life. Then M. de Treville, unwilling that it should be
thought that he had influenced the wounded man, requested M. de la
Tremouille to interrogate him himself.
That happened which M. de Treville had foreseen. Placed between life and
death, as Bernajoux was, he had no idea for a moment of concealing the
truth; and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had
passed.
This was all that M. de Treville wanted. He wished Bernajoux a speedy
convalescence, took leave of M. de la Tremouille, returned to his hotel,
and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited their
company at dinner.
M de Treville entertained good company, wholly anticardinalist, though.
It may easily be understood, therefore, that the conversation during the
whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his Eminenceâ€™s Guardsmen
had received. Now, as dâ€™Artagnan had been the hero of these two fights,
it was upon him that all the felicitations fell, which Athos, Porthos,
and Aramis abandoned to him, not only as good comrades, but as men who
had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his.
Toward six oâ€™clock M. de Treville announced that it was time to go to
the Louvre; but as the hour of audience granted by his Majesty was past,
instead of claiming the ENTREE by the back stairs, he placed himself
with the four young men in the antechamber. The king had not yet
returned from hunting. Our young men had been waiting about half an
hour, amid a crowd of courtiers, when all the doors were thrown open,
and his Majesty was announced.
At his announcement dâ€™Artagnan felt himself tremble to the very marrow
of his bones. The coming instant would in all probability decide the
rest of his life. His eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon
the door through which the king must enter.
Louis XIII appeared, walking fast. He was in hunting costume covered
with dust, wearing large boots, and holding a whip in his hand. At the
first glance, dâ€™Artagnan judged that the mind of the king was stormy.
This disposition, visible as it was in his Majesty, did not prevent the
courtiers from ranging themselves along his pathway. In royal
antechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not to
be seen at all. The three Musketeers therefore did not hesitate to make
a step forward. Dâ€™Artagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind
them; but although the king knew Athos, Porthos, and Aramis personally,
he passed before them without speaking or looking--indeed, as if he had
never seen them before. As for M. de Treville, when the eyes of the king
fell upon him, he sustained the look with so much firmness that it was
the king who dropped his eyes; after which his Majesty, grumbling,
entered his apartment.

NA
The four young men waited ten minutes, a quarter of an hour, twenty
minutes; and seeing that M. de Treville did not return, went away very
uneasy as to what was going to happen.
M de Treville entered the kingâ€™s cabinet boldly, and found his Majesty
in a very ill humor, seated on an armchair, beating his boot with the
handle of his whip. This, however, did not prevent his asking, with the
greatest coolness, after his Majestyâ€™s health.
NA
This was, in fact, the worst complaint of Louis XIII, who would
sometimes take one of his courtiers to a window and say, â€œMonsieur
NA
â€œHow! Your Majesty is bored? Have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the
NA
â€œA fine pleasure, indeed, monsieur! Upon my soul, everything
degenerates; and I donâ€™t know whether it is the game which leaves no
scent, or the dogs that have no noses. We started a stag of ten
branches. We chased him for six hours, and when he was near being
taken--when St.-Simon was already putting his horn to his mouth to sound
the mort--crack, all the pack takes the wrong scent and sets off after a
two-year-older. I shall be obliged to give up hunting, as I have given
up hawking. Ah, I am an unfortunate king, Monsieur de Treville! I had

â€œIndeed, sire, I wholly comprehend your disappointment. The misfortune
is great; but I think you have still a good number of falcons, sparrow
NA
â€œAnd not a man to instruct them. Falconers are declining. I know no one
but myself who is acquainted with the noble art of venery. After me it
will all be over, and people will hunt with gins, snares, and traps. If
I had but the time to train pupils! But there is the cardinal always at
hand, who does not leave me a momentâ€™s repose; who talks to me about
Spain, who talks to me about Austria, who talks to me about England! Ah!
NA
This was the chance at which M. de Treville waited for the king. He knew
the king of old, and he knew that all these complaints were but a
preface--a sort of excitation to encourage himself--and that he had now
come to his point at last.

asked M. de Treville, feigning the most profound astonishment.

without directly replying to de Trevilleâ€™s question. â€œIs it for this I

the hotel of the Duc de la Tremouille, and that they did not endeavor to
burn it?--which would not, perhaps, have been a great misfortune in time
of war, seeing that it is nothing but a nest of Huguenots, but which is,
in time of peace, a frightful example. Tell me, now, can you deny all

â€œNo, monsieur, no; I am not called Louis the Just without reason.
NA
NA
However ill the king might sleep, M. de Treville slept still worse. He
had ordered his three Musketeers and their companion to be with him at
half past six in the morning. He took them with him, without encouraging
them or promising them anything, and without concealing from them that
their luck, and even his own, depended upon the cast of the dice.
Arrived at the foot of the back stairs, he desired them to wait. If the
king was still irritated against them, they would depart without being
seen; if the king consented to see them, they would only have to be
called.
On arriving at the kingâ€™s private antechamber, M. de Treville found La
Chesnaye, who informed him that they had not been able to find M. de la
Tremouille on the preceding evening at his hotel, that he returned too
late to present himself at the Louvre, that he had only that moment
arrived and that he was at that very hour with the king.
This circumstance pleased M. de Treville much, as he thus became certain
that no foreign suggestion could insinuate itself between M. de la
Tremouilleâ€™s testimony and himself.
In fact, ten minutes had scarcely passed away when the door of the
kingâ€™s closet opened, and M. de Treville saw M. de la Tremouille come
out. The duke came straight up to him, and said: â€œMonsieur de Treville,
his Majesty has just sent for me in order to inquire respecting the
circumstances which took place yesterday at my hotel. I have told him
the truth; that is to say, that the fault lay with my people, and that I
was ready to offer you my excuses. Since I have the good fortune to meet
you, I beg you to receive them, and to hold me always as one of your
NA
NA
loyalty that I required no other defender before his Majesty than
yourself. I find that I have not been mistaken, and I thank you that
there is still one man in France of whom may be said, without
NA
NA
through the open door; â€œonly tell him, Treville, since he wishes to be
considered your friend, that I also wish to be one of his, but he
neglects me; that it is nearly three years since I have seen him, and
that I never do see him unless I send for him. Tell him all this for me,
NA
NA
that it is not those--I do not speak of Monsieur de Treville--whom your

â€œAh! You have heard what I said? So much the better, Duke, so much the

Treville. Where are your Musketeers? I told you the day before yesterday
NA
â€œThey are below, sire, and with your permission La Chesnaye will bid
NA
â€œYes, yes, let them come up immediately. It is nearly eight oâ€™clock, and
at nine I expect a visit. Go, Monsieur Duke, and return often. Come in,
NA
The Duke saluted and retired. At the moment he opened the door, the
three Musketeers and dâ€™Artagnan, conducted by La Chesnaye, appeared at
the top of the staircase.
NA
The Musketeers advanced, bowing, dâ€™Artagnan following closely behind
them.

Dâ€™Artagnan, who understood that it was to him this compliment was
addressed, approached, assuming a most deprecating air.

boy! Do you mean to say that it was he who bestowed that severe thrust

Dâ€™Artagnan related the adventure of the preceding day in all its
details; how, not having been able to sleep for the joy he felt in the
expectation of seeing his Majesty, he had gone to his three friends
three hours before the hour of audience; how they had gone together to
the tennis court, and how, upon the fear he had manifested lest he
receive a ball in the face, he had been jeered at by Bernajoux, who had
nearly paid for his jeer with his life, and M. de la Tremouille, who had
nothing to do with the matter, with the loss of his hotel.

At this epoch, the ideas of pride which are in fashion in our days did
not prevail. A gentleman received, from hand to hand, money from the
king, and was not the least in the world humiliated. Dâ€™Artagnan put his
forty pistoles into his pocket without any scruple--on the contrary,
thanking his Majesty greatly.
NA

beforehand the face the cardinal will make. He will be furious; but I

The king waved his hand to Treville, who left him and rejoined the
Musketeers, whom he found sharing the forty pistoles with dâ€™Artagnan.
The cardinal, as his Majesty had said, was really furious, so furious
that during eight days he absented himself from the kingâ€™s gaming table.
This did not prevent the king from being as complacent to him as
possible whenever he met him, or from asking in the kindest tone, â€œWell,
Monsieur Cardinal, how fares it with that poor Jussac and that poor

7 THE INTERIOR* OF THE MUSKETEERS
When dâ€™Artagnan was out of the Louvre, and consulted his friends upon
the use he had best make of his share of the forty pistoles, Athos
advised him to order a good repast at the Pomme-de-Pin, Porthos to
engage a lackey, and Aramis to provide himself with a suitable mistress.
    _*Domestic affairs, housekeeping_
The repast was carried into effect that very day, and the lackey waited
at table. The repast had been ordered by Athos, and the lackey furnished
by Porthos. He was a Picard, whom the glorious Musketeer had picked up
on the Bridge Tournelle, making rings and plashing in the water.
Porthos pretended that this occupation was proof of a reflective and
contemplative organization, and he had brought him away without any
other recommendation. The noble carriage of this gentleman, for whom he
believed himself to be engaged, had won Planchet--that was the name of
the Picard. He felt a slight disappointment, however, when he saw that
this place was already taken by a compeer named Mousqueton, and when
Porthos signified to him that the state of his household, though great,
would not support two servants, and that he must enter into the service
of dâ€™Artagnan. Nevertheless, when he waited at the dinner given by his
master, and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it, he
believed his fortune made, and returned thanks to heaven for having
thrown him into the service of such a Croesus. He preserved this opinion
even after the feast, with the remnants of which he repaired his own
long abstinence; but when in the evening he made his masterâ€™s bed, the
chimeras of Planchet faded away. The bed was the only one in the
apartment, which consisted of an antechamber and a bedroom. Planchet
slept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of
dâ€™Artagnan, and which dâ€™Artagnan from that time made shift to do
without.
Athos, on his part, had a valet whom he had trained in his service in a
thoroughly peculiar fashion, and who was named Grimaud. He was very
taciturn, this worthy signor. Be it understood we are speaking of Athos.
During the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest intimacy
with his companions, Porthos and Aramis, they could remember having
often seen him smile, but had never heard him laugh. His words were
brief and expressive, conveying all that was meant, and no more; no
embellishments, no embroidery, no arabesques. His conversation was a
matter of fact, without a single romance.
Although Athos was scarcely thirty years old, and was of great personal
beauty and intelligence of mind, no one knew whether he had ever had a
mistress. He never spoke of women. He certainly did not prevent others
from speaking of them before him, although it was easy to perceive that
this kind of conversation, in which he only mingled by bitter words and
misanthropic remarks, was very disagreeable to him. His reserve, his
roughness, and his silence made almost an old man of him. He had, then,
in order not to disturb his habits, accustomed Grimaud to obey him upon
a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his lips. He never spoke
to him, except under the most extraordinary occasions.
Sometimes, Grimaud, who feared his master as he did fire, while
entertaining a strong attachment to his person and a great veneration
for his talents, believed he perfectly understood what he wanted, flew
to execute the order received, and did precisely the contrary. Athos
then shrugged his shoulders, and, without putting himself in a passion,
thrashed Grimaud. On these days he spoke a little.
Porthos, as we have seen, had a character exactly opposite to that of
Athos. He not only talked much, but he talked loudly, little caring, we
must render him that justice, whether anybody listened to him or not. He
talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing
himself talk. He spoke upon all subjects except the sciences, alleging
in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his
childhood. He had not so noble an air as Athos, and the commencement of
their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman, whom he
endeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress. But with his simple
Musketeerâ€™s uniform and nothing but the manner in which he threw back
his head and advanced his foot, Athos instantly took the place which was
his due and consigned the ostentatious Porthos to the second rank.
Porthos consoled himself by filling the antechamber of M. de Treville
and the guardroom of the Louvre with the accounts of his love scrapes,
after having passed from professional ladies to military ladies, from
the lawyerâ€™s dame to the baroness, there was question of nothing less
with Porthos than a foreign princess, who was enormously fond of him.
NA
the valet of Athos to the valet of Porthos, from Grimaud to Mousqueton.
Mousqueton was a Norman, whose pacific name of Boniface his master had
changed into the infinitely more sonorous name of Mousqueton. He had
entered the service of Porthos upon condition that he should only be
clothed and lodged, though in a handsome manner; but he claimed two
hours a day to himself, consecrated to an employment which would provide
for his other wants. Porthos agreed to the bargain; the thing suited him
wonderfully well. He had doublets cut out of his old clothes and
cast-off cloaks for Mousqueton, and thanks to a very intelligent tailor,
who made his clothes look as good as new by turning them, and whose wife
was suspected of wishing to make Porthos descend from his aristocratic
habits, Mousqueton made a very good figure when attending on his master.
As for Aramis, of whom we believe we have sufficiently explained the
character--a character which, like that of his companions, we shall be
able to follow in its development--his lackey was called Bazin. Thanks
to the hopes which his master entertained of someday entering into
orders, he was always clothed in black, as became the servant of a
churchman. He was a Berrichon, thirty-five or forty years old, mild,
peaceable, sleek, employing the leisure his master left him in the
perusal of pious works, providing rigorously for two a dinner of few
dishes, but excellent. For the rest, he was dumb, blind, and deaf, and
of unimpeachable fidelity.
And now that we are acquainted, superficially at least, with the masters
and the valets, let us pass on to the dwellings occupied by each of
them.
Athos dwelt in the Rue Ferou, within two steps of the Luxembourg. His
apartment consisted of two small chambers, very nicely fitted up, in a
furnished house, the hostess of which, still young and still really
handsome, cast tender glances uselessly at him. Some fragments of past
splendor appeared here and there upon the walls of this modest lodging;
a sword, for example, richly embossed, which belonged by its make to the
times of Francis I, the hilt of which alone, encrusted with precious
stones, might be worth two hundred pistoles, and which, nevertheless, in
his moments of greatest distress Athos had never pledged or offered for
sale. It had long been an object of ambition for Porthos. Porthos would
have given ten years of his life to possess this sword.
One day, when he had an appointment with a duchess, he endeavored even
to borrow it of Athos. Athos, without saying anything, emptied his
pockets, got together all his jewels, purses, aiguillettes, and gold
chains, and offered them all to Porthos; but as to the sword, he said it
was sealed to its place and should never quit it until its master should
himself quit his lodgings. In addition to the sword, there was a
portrait representing a nobleman of the time of Henry III, dressed with
the greatest elegance, and who wore the Order of the Holy Ghost; and
this portrait had certain resemblances of lines with Athos, certain
family likenesses which indicated that this great noble, a knight of the
Order of the King, was his ancestor.
Besides these, a casket of magnificent goldwork, with the same arms as
the sword and the portrait, formed a middle ornament to the mantelpiece,
and assorted badly with the rest of the furniture. Athos always carried
the key of this coffer about him; but he one day opened it before
Porthos, and Porthos was convinced that this coffer contained nothing
but letters and papers--love letters and family papers, no doubt.
Porthos lived in an apartment, large in size and of very sumptuous
appearance, in the Rue du Vieux-Colombier. Every time he passed with a
friend before his windows, at one of which Mousqueton was sure to be
placed in full livery, Porthos raised his head and his hand, and said,
NA
invited anybody to go up with him, and no one could form an idea of what
his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real riches.
As to Aramis, he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir, an
eating room, and a bedroom, which room, situated, as the others were, on
the ground floor, looked out upon a little fresh green garden, shady and
impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors.
With regard to dâ€™Artagnan, we know how he was lodged, and we have
already made acquaintance with his lackey, Master Planchet.
Dâ€™Artagnan, who was by nature very curious--as people generally are who
possess the genius of intrigue--did all he could to make out who Athos,
Porthos, and Aramis really were (for under these pseudonyms each of
these young men concealed his family name)--Athos in particular, who, a
league away, savored of nobility. He addressed himself then to Porthos
to gain information respecting Athos and Aramis, and to Aramis in order
to learn something of Porthos.
Unfortunately Porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion
but what revealed itself. It was said Athos had met with great crosses
in love, and that a frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life of
this gallant man. What could this treachery be? All the world was
ignorant of it.
As to Porthos, except his real name (as was the case with those of his
two comrades), his life was very easily known. Vain and indiscreet, it
was as easy to see through him as through a crystal. The only thing to
mislead the investigator would have been belief in all the good things
he said of himself.
With respect to Aramis, though having the air of having nothing secret
about him, he was a young fellow made up of mysteries, answering little
to questions put to him about others, and having learned from him the
report which prevailed concerning the success of the Musketeer with a
princess, wished to gain a little insight into the amorous adventures of
NA
NA
â€œPARDIEU! I spoke of them because Porthos talked of them himself,
because he had paraded all these fine things before me. But be assured,
my dear Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan, that if I had obtained them from any other
source, or if they had been confided to me, there exists no confessor
NA
NA
you are tolerably familiar with coats of arms--a certain embroidered
handkerchief, for instance, to which I owe the honor of your
NA
This time Aramis was not angry, but assumed the most modest air and
replied in a friendly tone, â€œMy dear friend, do not forget that I wish
to belong to the Church, and that I avoid all mundane opportunities. The
handkerchief you saw had not been given to me, but it had been forgotten
and left at my house by one of my friends. I was obliged to pick it up
in order not to compromise him and the lady he loves. As for myself, I
neither have, nor desire to have, a mistress, following in that respect
NA
NA
â€œA Musketeer for a time, my friend, as the cardinal says, a Musketeer
against my will, but a churchman at heart, believe me. Athos and Porthos
dragged me into this to occupy me. I had, at the moment of being
ordained, a little difficulty with--But that would not interest you, and

to the Rue St. Honore in order to purchase some rouge for Madame de
Chevreuse. So you see, my dear friend, that if you are not in a hurry, I
NA
Aramis held out his hand in a cordial manner to his young companion, and
took leave of him.
Notwithstanding all the pains he took, dâ€™Artagnan was unable to learn
any more concerning his three new-made friends. He formed, therefore,
the resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their
past, hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the future. In
the meanwhile, he looked upon Athos as an Achilles, Porthos as an Ajax,
and Aramis as a Joseph.
As to the rest, the life of the four young friends was joyous enough.
Athos played, and that as a rule unfortunately. Nevertheless, he never
borrowed a sou of his companions, although his purse was ever at their
service; and when he had played upon honor, he always awakened his
creditor by six oâ€™clock the next morning to pay the debt of the
preceding evening.
Porthos had his fits. On the days when he won he was insolent and
ostentatious; if he lost, he disappeared completely for several days,
after which he reappeared with a pale face and thinner person, but with
money in his purse.
As to Aramis, he never played. He was the worst Musketeer and the most
unconvivial companion imaginable. He had always something or other to
do. Sometimes in the midst of dinner, when everyone, under the
attraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation, believed they had
two or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table, Aramis looked at
his watch, arose with a bland smile, and took leave of the company, to
go, as he said, to consult a casuist with whom he had an appointment. At
other times he would return home to write a treatise, and requested his
friends not to disturb him.
At this Athos would smile, with his charming, melancholy smile, which so
became his noble countenance, and Porthos would drink, swearing that
Aramis would never be anything but a village CURE.
Planchet, dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s valet, supported his good fortune nobly. He
received thirty sous per day, and for a month he returned to his
lodgings gay as a chaffinch, and affable toward his master. When the
wind of adversity began to blow upon the housekeeping of the Rue des
Fossoyeurs--that is to say, when the forty pistoles of King Louis XIII
were consumed or nearly so--he commenced complaints which Athos thought
nauseous, Porthos indecent, and Aramis ridiculous. Athos counseled
dâ€™Artagnan to dismiss the fellow; Porthos was of the opinion that he
should give him a good thrashing first; and Aramis contended that a
master should never attend to anything but the civilities paid to him.
NA
Athos, who live like a dumb man with Grimaud, who forbid him to speak,
and consequently never exchange ill words with him; for you, Porthos,
who carry matters in such a magnificent style, and are a god to your
valet, Mousqueton; and for you, Aramis, who, always abstracted by your
theological studies, inspire your servant, Bazin, a mild, religious man,
with a profound respect; but for me, who am without any settled means
and without resources--for me, who am neither a Musketeer nor even a
Guardsman, what am I to do to inspire either the affection, the terror,

Dâ€™Artagnan did reflect, and resolved to thrash Planchet provisionally;
which he did with the conscientiousness that dâ€™Artagnan carried into
everything. After having well beaten him, he forbade him to leave his

to mend; I inevitably look for better times. Your fortune is therefore
made if you remain with me, and I am too good a master to allow you to
NA
This manner of acting roused much respect for dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s policy among
the Musketeers. Planchet was equally seized with admiration, and said no
more about going away.
The life of the four young men had become fraternal. Dâ€™Artagnan, who had
no settled habits of his own, as he came from his province into the
midst of a world quite new to him, fell easily into the habits of his
friends.
They rose about eight oâ€™clock in the winter, about six in summer, and
went to take the countersign and see how things went on at M. de
Trevilleâ€™s. Dâ€™Artagnan, although he was not a Musketeer, performed the
duty of one with remarkable punctuality. He went on guard because he
always kept company with whoever of his friends was on duty. He was well
known at the Hotel of the Musketeers, where everyone considered him a
good comrade. M. de Treville, who had appreciated him at the first
glance and who bore him a real affection, never ceased recommending him
to the king.
On their side, the three Musketeers were much attached to their young
comrade. The friendship which united these four men, and the need they
felt of seeing another three or four times a day, whether for dueling,
business, or pleasure, caused them to be continually running after one
another like shadows; and the Inseparables were constantly to be met
with seeking one another, from the Luxembourg to the Place St. Sulpice,
or from the Rue du Vieux-Colombier to the Luxembourg.
In the meanwhile the promises of M. de Treville went on prosperously.
One fine morning the king commanded M. de Chevalier Dessessart to admit
dâ€™Artagnan as a cadet in his company of Guards. Dâ€™Artagnan, with a sigh,
donned his uniform, which he would have exchanged for that of a
Musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence. But M. de
Treville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years--a novitiate
which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself
for dâ€™Artagnan to render the king any signal service, or to distinguish
himself by some brilliant action. Upon this promise dâ€™Artagnan withdrew,
and the next day he began service.
Then it became the turn of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis to mount guard
with dâ€™Artagnan when he was on duty. The company of M. le Chevalier
Dessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted
dâ€™Artagnan.
8 CONCERNING A COURT INTRIGUE
In the meantime, the forty pistoles of King Louis XIII, like all other
things of this world, after having had a beginning had an end, and after
this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed. At first,
Athos supported the association for a time with his own means.
Porthos succeeded him; and thanks to one of those disappearances to
which he was accustomed, he was able to provide for the wants of all for
a fortnight. At last it became Aramisâ€™s turn, who performed it with a
good grace and who succeeded--as he said, by selling some theological
books--in procuring a few pistoles.
Then, as they had been accustomed to do, they had recourse to M. de
Treville, who made some advances on their pay; but these advances could
not go far with three Musketeers who were already much in arrears and a
Guardsman who as yet had no pay at all.
At length when they found they were likely to be really in want, they
got together, as a last effort, eight or ten pistoles, with which
Porthos went to the gaming table. Unfortunately he was in a bad vein; he
lost all, together with twenty-five pistoles for which he had given his
word.
Then the inconvenience became distress. The hungry friends, followed by
their lackeys, were seen haunting the quays and Guard rooms, picking up
among their friends abroad all the dinners they could meet with; for
according to the advice of Aramis, it was prudent to sow repasts right
and left in prosperity, in order to reap a few in time of need.
Athos was invited four times, and each time took his friends and their
lackeys with him. Porthos had six occasions, and contrived in the same
manner that his friends should partake of them; Aramis had eight of
them. He was a man, as must have been already perceived, who made but
little noise, and yet was much sought after.
As to dâ€™Artagnan, who as yet knew nobody in the capital, he only found
one chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province,
and one dinner at the house of a cornet of the Guards. He took his army
to the priestâ€™s, where they devoured as much provision as would have
lasted him for two months, and to the cornetâ€™s, who performed wonders;
but as Planchet said, â€œPeople do not eat at once for all time, even when
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal
and a half for his companions--as the breakfast at the priestâ€™s could
only be counted as half a repast--in return for the feasts which Athos,
Porthos, and Aramis had procured him. He fancied himself a burden to the
society, forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith that he had fed
this society for a month; and he set his mind actively to work. He
reflected that this coalition of four young, brave, enterprising, and
active men ought to have some other object than swaggering walks,
fencing lessons, and practical jokes, more or less witty.
In fact, four men such as they were--four men devoted to one another,
from their purses to their lives; four men always supporting one
another, never yielding, executing singly or together the resolutions
formed in common; four arms threatening the four cardinal points, or
turning toward a single point--must inevitably, either subterraneously,
in open day, by mining, in the trench, by cunning, or by force, open
themselves a way toward the object they wished to attain, however well
it might be defended, or however distant it may seem. The only thing
that astonished dâ€™Artagnan was that his friends had never thought of
this.
He was thinking by himself, and even seriously racking his brain to find
a direction for this single force four times multiplied, with which he
did not doubt, as with the lever for which Archimedes sought, they
should succeed in moving the world, when someone tapped gently at his
door. Dâ€™Artagnan awakened Planchet and ordered him to open it.
NA
suppose it was night, or that day was hardly come. No, it had just
struck four. Planchet, two hours before, had asked his master for some
dinner, and he had answered him with the proverb, â€œHe who sleeps,
NA
A man was introduced of simple mien, who had the appearance of a
tradesman. Planchet, by way of dessert, would have liked to hear the
conversation; but the citizen declared to dâ€™Artagnan that, what he had
to say being important and confidential, he desired to be left alone
with him.
Dâ€™Artagnan dismissed Planchet, and requested his visitor to be seated.
There was a moment of silence, during which the two men looked at each
other, as if to make a preliminary acquaintance, after which dâ€™Artagnan
bowed, as a sign that he listened.
NA
said the citizen; â€œand this reputation which he justly enjoys had
NA
NA
something advantageous.
The citizen made a fresh pause and continued, â€œI have a wife who is
seamstress to the queen, monsieur, and who is not deficient in either
virtue or beauty. I was induced to marry her about three years ago,
although she had but very little dowry, because Monsieur Laporte, the

secret to confide in me. Act, then, as you think proper; there is still

â€œNo, monsieur, no; you appear to be an honest young man, and I will have
confidence in you. I believe, then, that it is not on account of any
intrigues of her own that my wife has been arrested, but because of

being posted as to court affairs.

â€œFrom Monsieur Laporte. Did I not tell you that she was the goddaughter
of Monsieur Laporte, the confidential man of the queen? Well, Monsieur
Laporte placed her near her Majesty in order that our poor queen might
at least have someone in whom she could place confidence, abandoned as
she is by the king, watched as she is by the cardinal, betrayed as she

NA
â€œNow, my wife came home four days ago, monsieur. One of her conditions
was that she should come and see me twice a week; for, as I had the
honor to tell you, my wife loves me dearly--my wife, then, came and
confided to me that the queen at that very moment entertained great

NA
â€œYes. The cardinal, as it appears, pursues her and persecutes her more
than ever. He cannot pardon her the history of the Saraband. You know
NA
NA
who wished to appear to know everything that was going on.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œShe believes that someone has written to the Duke of Buckingham in her
NA
NA
â€œYes, to make him come to Paris; and when once come to Paris, to draw
NA
NA
â€œHer devotion to the queen is known; and they wish either to remove her
from her mistress, or to intimidate her, in order to obtain her

swarthy complexion, piercing eye, white teeth, and has a scar on his

NA
piercing eye, dark complexion, black hair, and haughty carriage--why,
NA
NA
â€œYes, yes; but that has nothing to do with it. No, I am wrong. On the
contrary, that simplifies the matter greatly. If your man is mine, with
one blow I shall obtain two revenges, thatâ€™s all; but where to find this

NA
NA
â€œNone. One day, as I was conveying my wife back to the Louvre, he was

â€œYou said, then, by the word of Bonacieux. Pardon me for interrupting

NA

The citizen took a paper from his pocket, and presented it to
dâ€™Artagnan.

Dâ€™Artagnan opened it, and as the day was beginning to decline, he
approached the window to read it. The citizen followed him.

NA
NA
â€œYes; but that menace terrifies me. I am not a fighting man at all,

NA

appearance, and knowing that these Musketeers belong to Monsieur de
Treville, and were consequently enemies of the cardinal, I thought that
you and your friends, while rendering justice to your poor queen, would

â€œI am comfortably off, monsieur, thatâ€™s all; I have scraped together
some such things as an income of two or three thousand crowns in the
haberdashery business, but more particularly in venturing some funds in

NA

NA
NA
having recognized his man.
NA
NA
Drawing his sword from its scabbard, he rushed out of the apartment. On
the staircase he met Athos and Porthos, who were coming to see him. They
separated, and dâ€™Artagnan rushed between them like a dart.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with
the stranger, as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner, to
whom this man had confided some important missive.
The opinion of Athos was that dâ€™Artagnan had lost his letter in the
skirmish. A gentleman, in his opinion--and according to dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s
portrait of him, the stranger must be a gentleman--would be incapable of
the baseness of stealing a letter.
Porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting, given by a lady to a
cavalier, or by a cavalier to a lady, which had been disturbed by the
presence of dâ€™Artagnan and his yellow horse.
Aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious, it was
better not to fathom them.
They understood, then, from the few words which escaped from dâ€™Artagnan,
what affair was in hand, and as they thought that overtaking his man, or
losing sight of him, dâ€™Artagnan would return to his rooms, they kept on
their way.
When they entered dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s chamber, it was empty; the landlord,
dreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to
take place between the young man and the stranger, had, consistent with
the character he had given himself, judged it prudent to decamp.
9 Dâ€™ARTAGNAN SHOWS HIMSELF
As Athos and Porthos had foreseen, at the expiration of a half hour,
dâ€™Artagnan returned. He had again missed his man, who had disappeared as
if by enchantment. Dâ€™Artagnan had run, sword in hand, through all the
neighboring streets, but had found nobody resembling the man he sought
for. Then he came back to the point where, perhaps, he ought to have
begun, and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had
leaned; but this proved useless--for though he knocked ten or twelve
times in succession, no one answered, and some of the neighbors, who put
their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the
noise, had assured him that that house, all the openings of which were
tightly closed, had not been inhabited for six months.
While dâ€™Artagnan was running through the streets and knocking at doors,
Aramis had joined his companions; so that on returning home dâ€™Artagnan
found the reunion complete.

At this speech of Aramis, the brow of Athos became clouded and he bit

Aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort, like a man who, in the
full relation of a falsehood, finds himself stopped by some unforeseen
obstacle; but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him,
their ears were wide open, and there were no means of retreat.

The three friends burst into laughter.

but seeing four Musketeers standing, and their swords by their sides,
they hesitated about going farther.

him, â€œYou are a shabby old fellow, my dear. You come to demand money of

The leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of

themselves alone. â€œShame, shame, for four Musketeers to allow an

formula dictated by dâ€™Artagnan:

NA
10 A MOUSETRAP IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
The invention of the mousetrap does not date from our days; as soon as
societies, in forming, had invented any kind of police, that police
invented mousetraps.
As perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the Rue de
Jerusalem, and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for the
first time to this thing, allow us to explain to them what is a
mousetrap.
When in a house, of whatever kind it may be, an individual suspected of
any crime is arrested, the arrest is held secret. Four or five men are
placed in ambuscade in the first room. The door is opened to all who
knock. It is closed after them, and they are arrested; so that at the
end of two or three days they have in their power almost all the
HABITUES of the establishment. And that is a mousetrap.
The apartment of M. Bonacieux, then, became a mousetrap; and whoever
appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinalâ€™s people. It
must be observed that as a separate passage led to the first floor, in
which dâ€™Artagnan lodged, those who called on him were exempted from this
detention.
Besides, nobody came thither but the three Musketeers; they had all been
engaged in earnest search and inquiries, but had discovered nothing.
Athos had even gone so far as to question M. de Treville--a thing which,
considering the habitual reticence of the worthy Musketeer, had very
much astonished his captain. But M. de Treville knew nothing, except
that the last time he had seen the cardinal, the king, and the queen,
the cardinal looked very thoughtful, the king uneasy, and the redness of
the queenâ€™s eyes donated that she had been sleepless or tearful. But
this last circumstance was not striking, as the queen since her marriage
had slept badly and wept much.
M de Treville requested Athos, whatever might happen, to be observant of
his duty to the king, but particularly to the queen, begging him to
convey his desires to his comrades.
As to dâ€™Artagnan, he did not budge from his apartment. He converted his
chamber into an observatory. From his windows he saw all the visitors
who were caught. Then, having removed a plank from his floor, and
nothing remaining but a simple ceiling between him and the room beneath,
in which the interrogatories were made, he heard all that passed between
the inquisitors and the accused.
The interrogatories, preceded by a minute search operated upon the
persons arrested, were almost always framed thus: â€œHas Madame Bonacieux
sent anything to you for her husband, or any other person? Has Monsieur
Bonacieux sent anything to you for his wife, or for any other person?
NA
NA
said dâ€™Artagnan to himself. â€œNow, what is it they want to know? Why,
they want to know if the Duke of Buckingham is in Paris, and if he has
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan held onto this idea, which, from what he had heard, was not
wanting in probability.
In the meantime, the mousetrap continued in operation, and likewise
dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s vigilance.
On the evening of the day after the arrest of poor Bonacieux, as Athos
had just left dâ€™Artagnan to report at M. de Trevilleâ€™s, as nine oâ€™clock
had just struck, and as Planchet, who had not yet made the bed, was
beginning his task, a knocking was heard at the street door. The door
was instantly opened and shut; someone was taken in the mousetrap.
Dâ€™Artagnan flew to his hole, laid himself down on the floor at full
length, and listened.
Cries were soon heard, and then moans, which someone appeared to be
endeavoring to stifle. There were no questions.
NA
NA
In spite of his prudence, dâ€™Artagnan restrained himself with great
difficulty from taking a part in the scene that was going on below.
â€œBut I tell you that I am the mistress of the house, gentlemen! I tell
NA
unfortunate woman.
NA
NA
The voice became more and more indistinct; a tumultuous movement shook
the partition. The victim resisted as much as a woman could resist four
men.
NA
heard in inarticulate sounds.
NA
dâ€™Artagnan to himself, springing up from the floor. â€œMy sword! Good, it
NA
NA
â€œRun and seek Athos, Porthos and Aramis. One of the three will certainly
be at home, perhaps all three. Tell them to take arms, to come here, and
NA
NA
NA
dâ€™Artagnan. â€œYou put back the boards, sweep the floor, go out at the
NA
NA
NA
the casement, he let himself gently down from the first story, which
fortunately was not very elevated, without doing himself the slightest
injury.
He then went straight to the door and knocked, murmuring, â€œI will go
myself and be caught in the mousetrap, but woe be to the cats that shall
NA
The knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before
the tumult ceased, steps approached, the door was opened, and
dâ€™Artagnan, sword in hand, rushed into the rooms of M. Bonacieux, the
door of which, doubtless acted upon by a spring, closed after him.
Then those who dwelt in Bonacieuxâ€™s unfortunate house, together with the
nearest neighbors, heard loud cries, stamping of feet, clashing of
swords, and breaking of furniture. A moment after, those who, surprised
by this tumult, had gone to their windows to learn the cause of it, saw
the door open, and four men, clothed in black, not COME out of it, but
FLY, like so many frightened crows, leaving on the ground and on the
corners of the furniture, feathers from their wings; that is to say,
patches of their clothes and fragments of their cloaks.
Dâ€™Artagnan was conqueror--without much effort, it must be confessed, for
only one of the officers was armed, and even he defended himself for
formâ€™s sake. It is true that the three others had endeavored to knock
the young man down with chairs, stools, and crockery; but two or three
scratches made by the Gasconâ€™s blade terrified them. Ten minutes
sufficed for their defeat, and dâ€™Artagnan remained master of the field
of battle.
The neighbors who had opened their windows, with the coolness peculiar
to the inhabitants of Paris in these times of perpetual riots and
disturbances, closed them again as soon as they saw the four men in
black flee--their instinct telling them that for the time all was over.
Besides, it began to grow late, and then, as today, people went to bed
early in the quarter of the Luxembourg.
On being left alone with Mme. Bonacieux, dâ€™Artagnan turned toward her;
the poor woman reclined where she had been left, half-fainting upon an
armchair. Dâ€™Artagnan examined her with a rapid glance.
She was a charming woman of twenty-five or twenty-six years, with dark
hair, blue eyes, and a nose slightly turned up, admirable teeth, and a
complexion marbled with rose and opal. There, however, ended the signs
which might have confounded her with a lady of rank. The hands were
white, but without delicacy; the feet did not bespeak the woman of
quality. Happily, dâ€™Artagnan was not yet acquainted with such niceties.
While dâ€™Artagnan was examining Mme. Bonacieux, and was, as we have said,
close to her, he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief, which he
picked up, as was his habit, and at the corner of which he recognized
the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused
him and Aramis to cut each otherâ€™s throat.
From that time, dâ€™Artagnan had been cautious with respect to
handkerchiefs with arms on them, and he therefore placed in the pocket
of Mme. Bonacieux the one he had just picked up.
At that moment Mme. Bonacieux recovered her senses. She opened her eyes,
looked around her with terror, saw that the apartment was empty and that
she was alone with her liberator. She extended her hands to him with a
smile. Mme. Bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the world.
NA
NA
NA
â€œOh, yes, monsieur, oh, yes; and I hope to prove to you that you have
not served an ingrate. But what could these men, whom I at first took
NA
â€œMadame, those men were more dangerous than any robbers could have been,
for they are the agents of the cardinal; and as to your husband,
Monsieur Bonacieux, he is not here because he was yesterday evening

NA

And something like a faint smile lighted the still-terrified features of
the young woman.

â€œSo far from it, madame, he was too proud of your prudence, and above

A second smile, almost imperceptible, stole over the rosy lips of the
pretty young woman.

â€œI took advantage of a moment when they left me alone; and as I had
known since morning the reason of my abduction, with the help of the
sheets I let myself down from the window. Then, as I believed my husband

defending me; but as he could serve us in other ways, I wished to inform

proper place for imparting confidences. The men I have put to flight

At these words she passed her arm under that of dâ€™Artagnan, and urged
him forward eagerly.

The young woman and the young man, without taking the trouble to shut
the door after them, descended the Rue des Fossoyeurs rapidly, turned
into the Rue des Fosses-Monsieur-le-Prince, and did not stop till they
came to the Place St. Sulpice.

NA

Both resumed their way. As dâ€™Artagnan had foreseen, Athos was not
within. He took the key, which was customarily given him as one of the
family, ascended the stairs, and introduced Mme. Bonacieux into the
little apartment of which we have given a description.

interval, and lighter.

Dâ€™Artagnan bowed to Mme. Bonacieux, darting at her the most loving
glance that he could possibly concentrate upon her charming little
person; and while he descended the stairs, he heard the door closed and
double-locked. In two bounds he was at the Louvre; as he entered the
wicket of Lâ€™Echelle, ten oâ€™clock struck. All the events we have
described had taken place within a half hour.
Everything fell out as Mme. Bonacieux prophesied. On hearing the
password, Germain bowed. In a few minutes, Laporte was at the lodge; in
two words dâ€™Artagnan informed him where Mme. Bonacieux was. Laporte
assured himself, by having it twice repeated, of the accurate address,
and set off at a run. Hardly, however, had he taken ten steps before he
returned.

Dâ€™Artagnan found his advice prudent. He took to his heels, and was soon
at M. de Trevilleâ€™s; but instead of going into the saloon with the rest
of the crowd, he asked to be introduced to M. de Trevilleâ€™s office. As
dâ€™Artagnan so constantly frequented the hotel, no difficulty was made in
complying with his request, and a servant went to inform M. de Treville
that his young compatriot, having something important to communicate,
solicited a private audience. Five minutes after, M. de Treville was
asking dâ€™Artagnan what he could do to serve him, and what caused his
visit at so late an hour.
NA
he had been left alone to put back M. de Trevilleâ€™s clock three-quarters
of an hour, â€œbut I thought, as it was yet only twenty-five minutes past
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Then dâ€™Artagnan told M. de Treville a long history about the queen. He
expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her Majesty;
he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with
regard to Buckingham, and all with a tranquillity and candor of which M.
de Treville was the more the dupe, from having himself, as we have said,
observed something fresh between the cardinal, the king, and the queen.
As ten oâ€™clock was striking, dâ€™Artagnan left M. de Treville, who thanked
him for his information, recommended him to have the service of the king
and queen always at heart, and returned to the saloon; but at the foot
of the stairs, dâ€™Artagnan remembered he had forgotten his cane. He
consequently sprang up again, re-entered the office, with a turn of his
finger set the clock right again, that it might not be perceived the
next day that it had been put wrong, and certain from that time that he
had a witness to prove his alibi, he ran downstairs and soon found
himself in the street.
11 IN WHICH THE PLOT THICKENS
His visit to M. de Treville being paid, the pensive dâ€™Artagnan took the
longest way homeward.
On what was dâ€™Artagnan thinking, that he strayed thus from his path,
gazing at the stars of heaven, and sometimes sighing, sometimes smiling?
He was thinking of Mme. Bonacieux. For an apprentice Musketeer the young
woman was almost an ideal of love. Pretty, mysterious, initiated in
almost all the secrets of the court, which reflected such a charming
gravity over her pleasing features, it might be surmised that she was
not wholly unmoved; and this is an irresistible charm to novices in
love. Moreover, dâ€™Artagnan had delivered her from the hands of the
demons who wished to search and ill treat her; and this important
service had established between them one of those sentiments of
gratitude which so easily assume a more tender character.
Dâ€™Artagnan already fancied himself, so rapid is the flight of our dreams
upon the wings of imagination, accosted by a messenger from the young
woman, who brought him some billet appointing a meeting, a gold chain,
or a diamond. We have observed that young cavaliers received presents
from their king without shame. Let us add that in these times of lax
morality they had no more delicacy with respect to the mistresses; and
that the latter almost always left them valuable and durable
remembrances, as if they essayed to conquer the fragility of their
sentiments by the solidity of their gifts.
Without a blush, men made their way in the world by the means of women
blushing. Such as were only beautiful gave their beauty, whence, without
doubt, comes the proverb, â€œThe most beautiful girl in the world can only
NA
money; and a vast number of heroes of that gallant period may be cited
who would neither have won their spurs in the first place, nor their
battles afterward, without the purse, more or less furnished, which
their mistress fastened to the saddle bow.
Dâ€™Artagnan owned nothing. Provincial diffidence, that slight varnish,
the ephemeral flower, that down of the peach, had evaporated to the
winds through the little orthodox counsels which the three Musketeers
gave their friend. Dâ€™Artagnan, following the strange custom of the
times, considered himself at Paris as on a campaign, neither more nor
less than if he had been in Flanders--Spain yonder, woman here. In each
there was an enemy to contend with, and contributions to be levied.
But, we must say, at the present moment dâ€™Artagnan was ruled by a
feeling much more noble and disinterested. The mercer had said that he
was rich; the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as M.
Bonacieux; and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of love,
which had been the consequence of it. We say ALMOST, for the idea that a
young, handsome, kind, and witty woman is at the same time rich takes
nothing from the beginning of love, but on the contrary strengthens it.
There are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which
are highly becoming to beauty. A fine and white stocking, a silken robe,
a lace kerchief, a pretty slipper on the foot, a tasty ribbon on the
head do not make an ugly woman pretty, but they make a pretty woman
beautiful, without reckoning the hands, which gain by all this; the
hands, among women particularly, to be beautiful must be idle.
Then dâ€™Artagnan, as the reader, from whom we have not concealed the
state of his fortune, very well knows--dâ€™Artagnan was not a millionaire;
he hoped to become one someday, but the time which in his own mind he
fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant. In the
meanwhile, how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those
thousands of nothings which constitute a womanâ€™s happiness, and be
unable to give her those thousands of nothings. At least, when the woman
is rich and the lover is not, that which he cannot offer she offers to
herself; and although it is generally with her husbandâ€™s money that she
procures herself this indulgence, the gratitude for it seldom reverts to
him.
Then dâ€™Artagnan, disposed to become the most tender of lovers, was at
the same time a very devoted friend. In the midst of his amorous
projects for the mercerâ€™s wife, he did not forget his friends. The
pretty Mme. Bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the Plain St.
Denis or in the fair of St. Germain, in company with Athos, Porthos, and
Aramis, to whom dâ€™Artagnan had often remarked this. Then one could enjoy
charming little dinners, where one touches on one side the hand of a
friend, and on the other the foot of a mistress. Besides, on pressing
occasions, in extreme difficulties, dâ€™Artagnan would become the
preserver of his friends.
And M. Bonacieux, whom dâ€™Artagnan had pushed into the hands of the
officers, denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to
save him? We are compelled to admit to our readers that dâ€™Artagnan
thought nothing about him in any way; or that if he did think of him, it
was only to say to himself that he was very well where he was, wherever
it might be. Love is the most selfish of all the passions.
Let our readers reassure themselves. If dâ€™Artagnan forgets his host, or
appears to forget him, under the pretense of not knowing where he has
been carried, we will not forget him, and we know where he is. But for
the moment, let us do as did the amorous Gascon; we will see after the
worthy mercer later.
Dâ€™Artagnan, reflecting on his future amours, addressing himself to the
beautiful night, and smiling at the stars, ascended the Rue
Cherish-Midi, or Chase-Midi, as it was then called. As he found himself
in the quarter in which Aramis lived, he took it into his head to pay
his friend a visit in order to explain the motives which had led him to
send Planchet with a request that he would come instantly to the
mousetrap. Now, if Aramis had been at home when Planchet came to his
abode, he had doubtless hastened to the Rue des Fossoyeurs, and finding
nobody there but his other two companions perhaps, they would not be
able to conceive what all this meant. This mystery required an
explanation; at least, so dâ€™Artagnan declared to himself.
He likewise thought this was an opportunity for talking about pretty
little Mme. Bonacieux, of whom his head, if not his heart, was already
full. We must never look for discretion in first love. First love is
accompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to
overflow, it will stifle you.
Paris for two hours past had been dark, and seemed a desert. Eleven
oâ€™clock sounded from all the clocks of the Faubourg St. Germain. It was
delightful weather. Dâ€™Artagnan was passing along a lane on the spot
where the Rue dâ€™Assas is now situated, breathing the balmy emanations
which were borne upon the wind from the Rue de Vaugirard, and which
arose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the breeze
of night. From a distance resounded, deadened, however, by good
shutters, the songs of the tipplers, enjoying themselves in the cabarets
scattered along the plain. Arrived at the end of the lane, dâ€™Artagnan
turned to the left. The house in which Aramis dwelt was situated between
the Rue Cassette and the Rue Servandoni.
Dâ€™Artagnan had just passed the Rue Cassette, and already perceived the
door of his friendâ€™s house, shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis
which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it, when he perceived
something like a shadow issuing from the Rue Servandoni. This something
was enveloped in a cloak, and dâ€™Artagnan at first believed it was a man;
but by the smallness of the form, the hesitation of the walk, and the
indecision of the step, he soon discovered that it was a woman. Further,
this woman, as if not certain of the house she was seeking, lifted up
her eyes to look around her, stopped, went backward, and then returned
again. Dâ€™Artagnan was perplexed.
NA
must be young; perhaps she is pretty. Oh, yes! But a woman who wanders
in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover. If I
should disturb a rendezvous, that would not be the best means of
NA
Meantime the young woman continued to advance, counting the houses and
windows. This was neither long nor difficult. There were but three
hotels in this part of the street; and only two windows looking toward
the road, one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which Aramis
occupied, the other belonging to Aramis himself.
NA
theologian reverted, â€œPARDIEU, it would be droll if this belated dove
should be in search of our friendâ€™s house. But on my soul, it looks so.
NA
making himself as small as he could, concealed himself in the darkest
side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche.
The young woman continued to advance; and in addition to the lightness
of her step, which had betrayed her, she emitted a little cough which
denoted a sweet voice. Dâ€™Artagnan believed this cough to be a signal.
Nevertheless, whether the cough had been answered by a similar signal
which had fixed the irresolution of the nocturnal seeker, or whether
without this aid she saw that she had arrived at the end of her journey,
she resolutely drew near to Aramisâ€™s shutter, and tapped, at three equal
intervals, with her bent finger.
NA
NA
The three blows were scarcely struck, when the inside blind was opened
and a light appeared through the panes of the outside shutter.
NA
Ah, this visit was expected. We shall see the windows open, and the lady
NA
But to the great astonishment of dâ€™Artagnan, the shutter remained
closed. Still more, the light which had shone for an instant
disappeared, and all was again in obscurity.
Dâ€™Artagnan thought this could not last long, and continued to look with
all his eyes and listen with all his ears.
He was right; at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard
inside. The young woman in the street replied by a single tap, and the
shutter was opened a little way.
It may be judged whether dâ€™Artagnan looked or listened with avidity.
Unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber; but the
eyes of the young man were accustomed to the night. Besides, the eyes of
the Gascons have, as it is asserted, like those of cats, the faculty of
seeing in the dark.
Dâ€™Artagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white
object, which she unfolded quickly, and which took the form of a
handkerchief. She made her interlocutor observe the corner of this
unfolded object.
This immediately recalled to dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s mind the handkerchief which he
had found at the feet of Mme. Bonacieux, which had reminded him of that
which he had dragged from under the feet of Aramis.
NA
Placed where he was, dâ€™Artagnan could not perceive the face of Aramis.
We say Aramis, because the young man entertained no doubt that it was
his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the
exterior. Curiosity prevailed over prudence; and profiting by the
preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have
plunged the two personages now on the scene, he stole from his hiding
place, and quick as lightning, but stepping with utmost caution, he ran
and placed himself close to the angle of the wall, from which his eye
could pierce the interior of Aramisâ€™s room.
Upon gaining this advantage dâ€™Artagnan was near uttering a cry of
surprise; it was not Aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal
visitor, it was a woman! Dâ€™Artagnan, however, could only see enough to
recognize the form of her vestments, not enough to distinguish her
features.
At the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from her
pocket, and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to her. Then
some words were spoken by the two women. At length the shutter closed.
The woman who was outside the window turned round, and passed within
four steps of dâ€™Artagnan, pulling down the hood of her mantle; but the
precaution was too late, dâ€™Artagnan had already recognized Mme.
Bonacieux.
Mme. Bonacieux! The suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of
dâ€™Artagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket; but what
probability was there that Mme. Bonacieux, who had sent for M. Laporte
in order to be reconducted to the Louvre, should be running about the
streets of Paris at half past eleven at night, at the risk of being
abducted a second time?
This must be, then, an affair of importance; and what is the most
important affair to a woman of twenty-five! Love.
But was it on her own account, or on account of another, that she
exposed herself to such hazards? This was a question the young man asked
himself, whom the demon of jealousy already gnawed, being in heart
neither more nor less than an accepted lover.
There was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither Mme.
Bonacieux was going; that was to follow her. This method was so simple
that dâ€™Artagnan employed it quite naturally and instinctively.
But at the sight of the young man, who detached himself from the wall
like a statue walking from its niche, and at the noise of the steps
which she heard resound behind her, Mme. Bonacieux uttered a little cry
and fled.
Dâ€™Artagnan ran after her. It was not difficult for him to overtake a
woman embarrassed with her cloak. He came up with her before she had
traversed a third of the street. The unfortunate woman was exhausted,
not by fatigue, but by terror, and when dâ€™Artagnan placed his hand upon
her shoulder, she sank upon one knee, crying in a choking voice, â€œKill
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist; but as he felt
by her weight she was on the point of fainting, he made haste to
reassure her by protestations of devotedness. These protestations were
nothing for Mme. Bonacieux, for such protestations may be made with the
worst intentions in the world; but the voice was all. Mme. Bonacieux
thought she recognized the sound of that voice; she reopened her eyes,
cast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so, and at once
perceiving it was dâ€™Artagnan, she uttered a cry of joy, â€œOh, it is you,
NA
NA
NA
NA
with a coquettish smile, whose somewhat bantering character resumed its
influence, and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in
which she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an enemy.
NA

NA

NA
NA
NA
â€œNot the least in the world. Besides, you must have seen that the person

Dâ€™Artagnan offered his arm to Mme. Bonacieux, who willingly took it,
half laughing, half trembling, and both gained the top of Rue de la
Harpe. Arriving there, the young woman seemed to hesitate, as she had
before done in the Rue Vaugirard. She seemed, however, by certain signs,

said she, â€œit is here I have business; a thousand thanks for your

â€œThat is because love has come suddenly upon me, and for the first time;

The young woman looked at him furtively.
NA
months ago I was near having a duel with Aramis concerning a
handkerchief resembling the one you showed to the woman in his

NA
NA
â€œBut you, madame, prudent as you are, think, if you were to be arrested
with that handkerchief, and that handkerchief were to be seized, would

Bonacieux, holding out her hand to him, and placing the other upon the
knocker of a little door almost hidden in the wall.
Dâ€™Artagnan seized the hand held out to him, and kissed it ardently.
NA
roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of politeness,
because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling
prevails over reason.
NA
pressing the hand of dâ€™Artagnan, who had not relinquished hers, â€œwell: I
will not say as much as you do; what is lost for today may not be lost
forever. Who knows, when I shall be at liberty, that I may not satisfy

NA
beside himself with joy.
â€œOh, as to that, I do not engage myself. That depends upon the

Now then, go, go, in the name of heaven! I was expected at sharp

NA

half-smile which was not exempt from a tinge of impatience.
â€œNo, no; I go, I depart! I believe in you, and I would have all the
merit of my devotion, even if that devotion were stupidity. Adieu,
NA
And as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort
from the hand he held, he sprang away, running, while Mme. Bonacieux
knocked, as at the shutter, three light and regular taps. When he had
gained the angle of the street, he turned. The door had been opened, and
shut again; the mercerâ€™s pretty wife had disappeared.
Dâ€™Artagnan pursued his way. He had given his word not to watch Mme.
Bonacieux, and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was
going or upon the person who should accompany her, dâ€™Artagnan would have
returned home, since he had so promised. Five minutes later he was in
the Rue des Fossoyeurs.

as that of Planchet; for, soliloquizing aloud, as very preoccupied
people do, he had entered the alley, at the end of which were the stairs
which led to his chamber.

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhy did he not tell them his name? Why did he not tell them he knew

â€œHe took care not to do so, monsieur; on the contrary, he came up to me
and said, â€˜It is your master that needs his liberty at this moment and

â€œFour conveyed him away, I donâ€™t know where--to the Bastille or Fort

this examination; then, when all was over, they went away, leaving the

NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, donâ€™t budge, then; if they come, tell them what has happened. Let
them wait for me at the Pomme-de-Pin. Here it would be dangerous; the

NA
NA

to recommend courage to his lackey.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, monsieur; and there is nothing I would not do to prove to Monsieur
NA
NA

NA
And with all the swiftness of his legs, already a little fatigued,
however, with the perambulations of the day, dâ€™Artagnan directed his
course toward M. de Trevilleâ€™s.
M de Treville was not at his hotel. His company was on guard at the
Louvre; he was at the Louvre with his company.
It was necessary to reach M. de Treville; it was important that he
should be informed of what was passing. Dâ€™Artagnan resolved to try and
enter the Louvre. His costume of Guardsman in the company of M.
Dessessart ought to be his passport.
He therefore went down the Rue des Petits Augustins, and came up to the
quay, in order to take the New Bridge. He had at first an idea of
crossing by the ferry; but on gaining the riverside, he had mechanically
put his hand into his pocket, and perceived that he had not wherewithal
to pay his passage.
As he gained the top of the Rue Guenegaud, he saw two persons coming out
of the Rue Dauphine whose appearance very much struck him. Of the two
persons who composed this group, one was a man and the other a woman.
The woman had the outline of Mme. Bonacieux; the man resembled Aramis so
much as to be mistaken for him.
Besides, the woman wore that black mantle which dâ€™Artagnan could still
see outlined on the shutter of the Rue de Vaugirard and on the door of
the Rue de la Harpe; still further, the man wore the uniform of a
Musketeer.
The womanâ€™s hood was pulled down, and the man held a handkerchief to his
face. Both, as this double precaution indicated, had an interest in not
being recognized.
They took the bridge. That was dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s road, as he was going to the
Louvre. Dâ€™Artagnan followed them.
He had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman
was really Mme. Bonacieux and that the man was Aramis.
He felt at that instant all the suspicions of jealousy agitating his
heart. He felt himself doubly betrayed, by his friend and by her whom he
already loved like a mistress. Mme. Bonacieux had declared to him, by
all the gods, that she did not know Aramis; and a quarter of an hour
after having made this assertion, he found her hanging on the arm of
Aramis.
Dâ€™Artagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercerâ€™s pretty
wife for three hours; that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude
for having delivered her from the men in black, who wished to carry her
off, and that she had promised him nothing. He considered himself an
outraged, betrayed, and ridiculed lover. Blood and anger mounted to his
face; he was resolved to unravel the mystery.
The young man and young woman perceived they were watched, and redoubled
their speed. Dâ€™Artagnan determined upon his course. He passed them, then
returned so as to meet them exactly before the Samaritaine, which was
illuminated by a lamp which threw its light over all that part of the
bridge.
Dâ€™Artagnan stopped before them, and they stopped before him.
NA
and with a foreign accent, which proved to dâ€™Artagnan that he was
deceived in one of his conjectures.
NA
â€œNo, monsieur, it is not Aramis; and by your exclamation I perceive you
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou are right, monsieur, it is not with you that I have anything to do;
NA
NA
NA
NA
your promise as a soldier and your word as a gentleman. I hoped to be
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan, however, stupefied, cast down, annihilated by all that

Bonacieux.
The Musketeer advanced two steps, and pushed dâ€™Artagnan aside with his
hand. Dâ€™Artagnan made a spring backward and drew his sword. At the same
time, and with the rapidity of lightning, the stranger drew his.

dâ€™Artagnan, who pressed it respectfully. â€œYou offer me your services;
with the same frankness I accept them. Follow us at a distance of twenty

Dâ€™Artagnan placed his naked sword under his arm, allowed the duke and
Mme. Bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead, and then followed them, ready
to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of Charles
I.
Fortunately, he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his
devotion, and the young woman and the handsome Musketeer entered the
Louvre by the wicket of the Echelle without any interference.
As for dâ€™Artagnan, he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the
Pomme-de-Pin, where he found Porthos and Aramis awaiting him. Without
giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused
them, he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he
had for a moment believed he should need their assistance.
Meanwhile, carried away as we are by our narrative, we must leave our
three friends to themselves, and follow the Duke of Buckingham and his
guide through the labyrinths of the Louvre.
12 GEORGE VILLIERS, DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM
Mme. Bonacieux and the duke entered the Louvre without difficulty. Mme.
Bonacieux was known to belong to the queen; the duke wore the uniform of
the Musketeers of M. de Treville, who, as we have said, were that
evening on guard. Besides, Germain was in the interests of the queen;
and if anything should happen, Mme. Bonacieux would be accused of having
introduced her lover into the Louvre, that was all. She took the risk
upon herself. Her reputation would be lost, it is true; but of what
value in the world was the reputation of the little wife of a mercer?
Once within the interior of the court, the duke and the young woman
followed the wall for the space of about twenty-five steps. This space
passed, Mme. Bonacieux pushed a little servantsâ€™ door, open by day but
generally closed at night. The door yielded. Both entered, and found
themselves in darkness; but Mme. Bonacieux was acquainted with all the
turnings and windings of this part of the Louvre, appropriated for the
people of the household. She closed the door after her, took the duke by
the hand, and after a few experimental steps, grasped a balustrade, put
her foot upon the bottom step, and began to ascend the staircase. The
duke counted two stories. She then turned to the right, followed the
course of a long corridor, descended a flight, went a few steps farther,
introduced a key into a lock, opened a door, and pushed the duke into an
apartment lighted only by a lamp, saying, â€œRemain here, my Lord Duke;
NA
locked, so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner.
Nevertheless, isolated as he was, we must say that the Duke of
Buckingham did not experience an instant of fear. One of the salient
points of his character was the search for adventures and a love of
romance. Brave, rash, and enterprising, this was not the first time he
had risked his life in such attempts. He had learned that the pretended
message from Anne of Austria, upon the faith of which he had come to
Paris, was a snare; but instead of regaining England, he had, abusing
the position in which he had been placed, declared to the queen that he
would not depart without seeing her. The queen had at first positively
refused; but at length became afraid that the duke, if exasperated,
would commit some folly. She had already decided upon seeing him and
urging his immediate departure, when, on the very evening of coming to
this decision, Mme. Bonacieux, who was charged with going to fetch the
duke and conducting him to the Louvre, was abducted. For two days no one
knew what had become of her, and everything remained in suspense; but
once free, and placed in communication with Laporte, matters resumed
their course, and she accomplished the perilous enterprise which, but
for her arrest, would have been executed three days earlier.
Buckingham, left alone, walked toward a mirror. His Musketeerâ€™s uniform
became him marvelously.
At thirty-five, which was then his age, he passed, with just title, for
the handsomest gentleman and the most elegant cavalier of France or
England.
The favorite of two kings, immensely rich, all-powerful in a kingdom
which he disordered at his fancy and calmed again at his caprice, George
Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, had lived one of those fabulous existences
which survive, in the course of centuries, to astonish posterity.
Sure of himself, convinced of his own power, certain that the laws which
rule other men could not reach him, he went straight to the object he
aimed at, even were this object were so elevated and so dazzling that it
would have been madness for any other even to have contemplated it. It
was thus he had succeeded in approaching several times the beautiful and
proud Anne of Austria, and in making himself loved by dazzling her.
George Villiers placed himself before the glass, as we have said,
restored the undulations to his beautiful hair, which the weight of his
hat had disordered, twisted his mustache, and, his heart swelling with
joy, happy and proud at being near the moment he had so long sighed for,
he smiled upon himself with pride and hope.
At this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened, and a woman
appeared. Buckingham saw this apparition in the glass; he uttered a cry.
It was the queen!
Anne of Austria was then twenty-six or twenty-seven years of age; that
is to say, she was in the full splendor of her beauty.
Her carriage was that of a queen or a goddess; her eyes, which cast the
brilliancy of emeralds, were perfectly beautiful, and yet were at the
same time full of sweetness and majesty.
Her mouth was small and rosy; and although her underlip, like that of
all princes of the House of Austria, protruded slightly beyond the
other, it was eminently lovely in its smile, but as profoundly
disdainful in its contempt.
Her skin was admired for its velvety softness; her hands and arms were
of surpassing beauty, all the poets of the time singing them as
incomparable.
Lastly, her hair, which, from being light in her youth, had become
chestnut, and which she wore curled very plainly, and with much powder,
admirably set off her face, in which the most rigid critic could only
have desired a little less rouge, and the most fastidious sculptor a
little more fineness in the nose.
Buckingham remained for a moment dazzled. Never had Anne of Austria
appeared to him so beautiful, amid balls, fetes, or carousals, as she
appeared to him at this moment, dressed in a simple robe of white satin,
and accompanied by Donna Estafania--the only one of her Spanish women
who had not been driven from her by the jealousy of the king or by the
persecutions of Richelieu.
Anne of Austria took two steps forward. Buckingham threw himself at her
feet, and before the queen could prevent him, kissed the hem of her
robe.
â€œDuke, you already know that it is not I who caused you to be written
NA
NA
must have been mad, senseless, to believe that snow would become
animated or marble warm; but what then! They who love believe easily in
NA
NA
insensible to all my sufferings, you persist in remaining in a city
where, by remaining, you run the risk of your life, and make me run the
risk of my honor. I see you to tell you that everything separates
us--the depths of the sea, the enmity of kingdoms, the sanctity of vows.
It is sacrilege to struggle against so many things, my Lord. In short, I
NA
NA
your voice covers the harshness of your words. You talk of sacrilege!
Why, the sacrilege is the separation of two hearts formed by God for
NA
NA
NA
â€œBut you have never told me that you did not love me; and truly, to
speak such words to me would be, on the part of your Majesty, too great
an ingratitude. For tell me, where can you find a love like mine--a love
which neither time, nor absence, nor despair can extinguish, a love
which contents itself with a lost ribbon, a stray look, or a chance
word? It is now three years, madame, since I saw you for the first time,
and during those three years I have loved you thus. Shall I tell you
each ornament of your toilet? Mark! I see you now. You were seated upon
cushions in the Spanish fashion; you wore a robe of green satin
embroidered with gold and silver, hanging sleeves knotted upon your
beautiful arms--those lovely arms--with large diamonds. You wore a close
ruff, a small cap upon your head of the same color as your robe, and in
that cap a heronâ€™s feather. Hold! Hold! I shut my eyes, and I can see
you as you then were; I open them again, and I see what you are now--a
NA
NA
fault with the duke for having so well preserved her portrait in his
NA
â€œAnd upon what then must I live? I have nothing but memory. It is my
happiness, my treasure, my hope. Every time I see you is a fresh diamond
which I enclose in the casket of my heart. This is the fourth which you
have let fall and I have picked up; for in three years, madame, I have
only seen you four times--the first, which I have described to you; the
second, at the mansion of Madame de Chevreuse; the third, in the gardens
NA
NA
â€œOh, let us speak of it; on the contrary, let us speak of it! That is
the most happy and brilliant evening of my life! You remember what a
beautiful night it was? How soft and perfumed was the air; how lovely
the blue heavens and star-enameled sky! Ah, then, madame, I was able for
one instant to be alone with you. Then you were about to tell me
all--the isolation of your life, the griefs of your heart. You leaned
upon my arm--upon this, madame! I felt, in bending my head toward you,
your beautiful hair touch my cheek; and every time that it touched me I
trembled from head to foot. Oh, Queen! Queen! You do not know what
felicity from heaven, what joys from paradise, are comprised in a moment
like that. Take my wealth, my fortune, my glory, all the days I have to
live, for such an instant, for a night like that. For that night,
NA
â€œMy Lord, yes; it is possible that the influence of the place, the charm
of the beautiful evening, the fascination of your look--the thousand
circumstances, in short, which sometimes unite to destroy a woman--were
grouped around me on that fatal evening; but, my Lord, you saw the queen
come to the aid of the woman who faltered. At the first word you dared
to utter, at the first freedom to which I had to reply, I called for
NA
â€œYes, yes, that is true. And any other love but mine would have sunk
beneath this ordeal; but my love came out from it more ardent and more
eternal. You believed that you would fly from me by returning to Paris;
you believed that I would not dare to quit the treasure over which my
master had charged me to watch. What to me were all the treasures in the
world, or all the kings of the earth! Eight days after, I was back
again, madame. That time you had nothing to say to me; I had risked my
life and favor to see you but for a second. I did not even touch your
NA
â€œYes, but calumny seized upon all those follies in which I took no part,
as you well know, my Lord. The king, excited by the cardinal, made a
terrible clamor. Madame de Vernet was driven from me, Putange was
exiled, Madame de Chevreuse fell into disgrace, and when you wished to
come back as ambassador to France, the king himself--remember, my
NA
â€œYes, and France is about to pay for her kingâ€™s refusal with a war. I am
not allowed to see you, madame, but you shall every day hear of me. What
object, think you, have this expedition to Re and this league with the
Protestants of La Rochelle which I am projecting? The pleasure of seeing
you. I have no hope of penetrating, sword in hand, to Paris, I know that
well. But this war may bring round a peace; this peace will require a
negotiator; that negotiator will be me. They will not dare to refuse me
then; and I will return to Paris, and will see you again, and will be
happy for an instant. Thousands of men, it is true, will have to pay for
my happiness with their lives; but what is that to me, provided I see
you again! All this is perhaps folly--perhaps insanity; but tell me what
NA
â€œMy Lord, my Lord, you invoke in your defense things which accuse you
more strongly. All these proofs of love which you would give me are
NA
â€œBecause you do not love me, madame! If you loved me, you would view all
this otherwise. If you loved me, oh, if you loved me, that would be too
great happiness, and I should run mad. Ah, Madame de Chevreuse was less
NA
NA
in spite of herself, by the expression of so profound a passion.
â€œYou would love me, then, if you were not queen! Madame, say that you
would love me then! I can believe that it is the dignity of your rank
alone which makes you cruel to me; I can believe that, had you been
Madame de Chevreuse, poor Buckingham might have hoped. Thanks for those
NA
â€œOh, my Lord! You have ill understood, wrongly interpreted; I did not
NA
NA
have the cruelty to lift me from it. You have told me yourself, madame,
that I have been drawn into a snare; I, perhaps, may leave my life in
it--for, although it may be strange, I have for some time had a
NA
smile at once sad and charming.
NA
proved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she
ventured to tell.
â€œI do not tell you this, madame, to terrify you; no, it is even
ridiculous for me to name it to you, and, believe me, I take no heed of
such dreams. But the words you have just spoken, the hope you have
NA
NA
NA
NA
Buckingham.
â€œYes, it was so, my Lord, it was so--in the left side, and with a knife.
Who can possibly have told you I had had that dream? I have imparted it
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, yes. Would God send the same dreams to you as to me if you did not
love me? Should we have the same presentiments if our existences did not
touch at the heart? You love me, my beautiful queen, and you will weep
NA
NA
bear. In the name of heaven, Duke, leave me, go! I do not know whether I
love you or love you not; but what I know is that I will not be
perjured. Take pity on me, then, and go! Oh, if you are struck in
France, if you die in France, if I could imagine that your love for me
was the cause of your death, I could not console myself; I should run
NA
NA
â€œGo, go, I implore you, and return hereafter! Come back as ambassador,
come back as minister, come back surrounded with guards who will defend
you, with servants who will watch over you, and then I shall no longer

NA

â€œOh, then, some pledge of your indulgence, some object which came from
you, and may remind me that I have not been dreaming; something you have

Anne of Austria re-entered her apartment, and came out again almost
immediately, holding a rosewood casket in her hand, with her cipher
encrusted with gold.
NA
Buckingham took the casket, and fell a second time on his knees.
NA
NA
Anne of Austria stretched forth her hand, closing her eyes, and leaning
with the other upon Estafania, for she felt that her strength was about
to fail her.
Buckingham pressed his lips passionately to that beautiful hand, and
then rising, said, â€œWithin six months, if I am not dead, I shall have
NA
faithful to the promise he had made, he rushed out of the apartment.
In the corridor he met Mme. Bonacieux, who waited for him, and who, with
the same precautions and the same good luck, conducted him out of the
Louvre.
13 MONSIEUR BONACIEUX
There was in all this, as may have been observed, one personage
concerned, of whom, notwithstanding his precarious position, we have
appeared to take but very little notice. This personage was M.
Bonacieux, the respectable martyr of the political and amorous intrigues
which entangled themselves so nicely together at this gallant and
chivalric period.
Fortunately, the reader may remember, or may not remember--fortunately
we have promised not to lose sight of him.
The officers who arrested him conducted him straight to the Bastille,
where he passed trembling before a party of soldiers who were loading
their muskets. Thence, introduced into a half-subterranean gallery, he
became, on the part of those who had brought him, the object of the
grossest insults and the harshest treatment. The officers perceived that
they had not to deal with a gentleman, and they treated him like a very
peasant.
At the end of half an hour or thereabouts, a clerk came to put an end to
his tortures, but not to his anxiety, by giving the order to conduct M.
Bonacieux to the Chamber of Examination. Ordinarily, prisoners were
interrogated in their cells; but they did not do so with M. Bonacieux.
Two guards attended the mercer who made him traverse a court and enter a
corridor in which were three sentinels, opened a door and pushed him
unceremoniously into a low room, where the only furniture was a table, a
chair, and a commissary. The commissary was seated in the chair, and was
writing at the table.
The two guards led the prisoner toward the table, and upon a sign from
the commissary drew back so far as to be unable to hear anything.
The commissary, who had till this time held his head down over his
papers, looked up to see what sort of person he had to do with. This
commissary was a man of very repulsive mien, with a pointed nose, with
yellow and salient cheek bones, with eyes small but keen and
penetrating, and an expression of countenance resembling at once the
polecat and the fox. His head, supported by a long and flexible neck,
issued from his large black robe, balancing itself with a motion very
much like that of the tortoise thrusting his head out of his shell. He
began by asking M. Bonacieux his name, age, condition, and abode.
The accused replied that his name was Jacques Michel Bonacieux, that he
was fifty-one years old, a retired mercer, and lived Rue des Fossoyeurs,
No. 14.
The commissary then, instead of continuing to interrogate him, made him
a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle
with public matters. He complicated this exordium by an exposition in
which he painted the power and the deeds of the cardinal, that
incomparable minister, that conqueror of past ministers, that example
for ministers to come--deeds and power which none could thwart with
impunity.
After this second part of his discourse, fixing his hawkâ€™s eye upon poor
Bonacieux, he bade him reflect upon the gravity of his situation.
The reflections of the mercer were already made; he cursed the instant
when M. Laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter, and
particularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as Lady
of the Linen to her Majesty.
At bottom the character of M. Bonacieux was one of profound selfishness
mixed with sordid avarice, the whole seasoned with extreme cowardice.
The love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary
sentiment, and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive
feelings we have just enumerated. Bonacieux indeed reflected on what had
just been said to him.

M Bonacieux was in the greatest perplexity possible. Had he better deny
everything or tell everything? By denying all, it might be suspected
that he must know too much to avow; by confessing all he might prove his
good will. He decided, then, to tell all.

him, I should recognize him in an instant, I will answer for it, were he

The face of the commissary grew still darker.

NA

horror.
NA
must have committed some frightful crime. They believe me her
accomplice, and will punish me with her. She must have spoken; she must
have confessed everything--a woman is so weak! A dungeon! The first he
comes to! Thatâ€™s it! A night is soon passed; and tomorrow to the wheel,
NA
Without listening the least in the world to the lamentations of M.
Bonacieux--lamentations to which, besides, they must have been pretty
well accustomed--the two guards took the prisoner each by an arm, and
led him away, while the commissary wrote a letter in haste and
dispatched it by an officer in waiting.
Bonacieux could not close his eyes; not because his dungeon was so very
disagreeable, but because his uneasiness was so great. He sat all night
on his stool, starting at the least noise; and when the first rays of
the sun penetrated into his chamber, the dawn itself appeared to him to
have taken funereal tints.
All at once he heard his bolts drawn, and made a terrified bound. He
believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold; so that when he
saw merely and simply, instead of the executioner he expected, only his
commissary of the preceding evening, attended by his clerk, he was ready
to embrace them both.
â€œYour affair has become more complicated since yesterday evening, my
good man, and I advise you to tell the whole truth; for your repentance

NA
NA

NA
â€œYes, but yesterday at five oâ€™clock in the afternoon, thanks to you, she

NA
â€œYou impose upon justice. Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan made a compact with you;
and in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested

NA
â€œFortunately, Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan is in our hands, and you shall be

NA

The two guards led in Athos.

NA
the poor questioner, who began to lose his head.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œSomebody said to me, â€˜You are Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan?â€™ I answered, â€˜You
think so?â€™ My guards exclaimed that they were sure of it. I did not wish
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œthere is not the least doubt about the matter. Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan is
my tenant, although he does not pay me my rent--and even better on that
account ought I to know him. Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan is a young man,
scarcely nineteen or twenty, and this gentleman must be thirty at least.
Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan is in Monsieur Dessessartâ€™s Guards, and this
gentleman is in the company of Monsieur de Trevilleâ€™s Musketeers. Look
NA
NA
At this moment the door was opened quickly, and a messenger, introduced
by one of the gatekeepers of the Bastille, gave a letter to the
commissary.
NA
â€œHow? What do you say? Of whom do you speak? It is not of my wife, I

NA
NA
The commissary designated by the same gesture Athos and Bonacieux, â€œLet
NA
NA

NA
NA
NA
Athos shrugged his shoulders, and followed his guards silently, while M.
Bonacieux uttered lamentations enough to break the heart of a tiger.
They locked the mercer in the same dungeon where he had passed the
night, and left him to himself during the day. Bonacieux wept all day,
like a true mercer, not being at all a military man, as he himself
informed us. In the evening, about nine oâ€™clock, at the moment he had
made up his mind to go to bed, he heard steps in his corridor. These
steps drew near to his dungeon, the door was thrown open, and the guards
appeared.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
without resistance.
He passed along the same corridor as before, crossed one court, then a
second side of a building; at length, at the gate of the entrance court
he found a carriage surrounded by four guards on horseback. They made
him enter this carriage, the officer placed himself by his side, the
door was locked, and they were left in a rolling prison. The carriage
was put in motion as slowly as a funeral car. Through the closely
fastened windows the prisoner could perceive the houses and the
pavement, that was all; but, true Parisian as he was, Bonacieux could
recognize every street by the milestones, the signs, and the lamps. At
the moment of arriving at St. Paul--the spot where such as were
condemned at the Bastille were executed--he was near fainting and
crossed himself twice. He thought the carriage was about to stop there.
The carriage, however, passed on.
Farther on, a still greater terror seized him on passing by the cemetery
of St. Jean, where state criminals were buried. One thing, however,
reassured him; he remembered that before they were buried their heads
were generally cut off, and he felt that his head was still on his
shoulders. But when he saw the carriage take the way to La Greve, when
he perceived the pointed roof of the Hotel de Ville, and the carriage
passed under the arcade, he believed it was over with him. He wished to
confess to the officer, and upon his refusal, uttered such pitiable
cries that the officer told him that if he continued to deafen him thus,
he should put a gag in his mouth.
This measure somewhat reassured Bonacieux. If they meant to execute him
at La Greve, it could scarcely be worth while to gag him, as they had
nearly reached the place of execution. Indeed, the carriage crossed the
fatal spot without stopping. There remained, then, no other place to
fear but the Traitorâ€™s Cross; the carriage was taking the direct road to
it.
This time there was no longer any doubt; it was at the Traitorâ€™s Cross
that lesser criminals were executed. Bonacieux had flattered himself in
believing himself worthy of St. Paul or of the Place de Greve; it was at
the Traitorâ€™s Cross that his journey and his destiny were about to end!
He could not yet see that dreadful cross, but he felt somehow as if it
were coming to meet him. When he was within twenty paces of it, he heard
a noise of people and the carriage stopped. This was more than poor
Bonacieux could endure, depressed as he was by the successive emotions
which he had experienced; he uttered a feeble groan which night have
been taken for the last sigh of a dying man, and fainted.
14 THE MAN OF MEUNG
The crowd was caused, not by the expectation of a man to be hanged, but
by the contemplation of a man who was hanged.
The carriage, which had been stopped for a minute, resumed its way,
passed through the crowd, threaded the Rue St. Honore, turned into the
Rue des Bons Enfants, and stopped before a low door.
The door opened; two guards received Bonacieux in their arms from the
officer who supported him. They carried him through an alley, up a
flight of stairs, and deposited him in an antechamber.
All these movements had been effected mechanically, as far as he was
concerned. He had walked as one walks in a dream; he had a glimpse of
objects as through a fog. His ears had perceived sounds without
comprehending them; he might have been executed at that moment without
his making a single gesture in his own defense or uttering a cry to
implore mercy.
He remained on the bench, with his back leaning against the wall and his
hands hanging down, exactly on the spot where the guards placed him.
On looking around him, however, as he could perceive no threatening
object, as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger, as the bench
was comfortably covered with a well-stuffed cushion, as the wall was
ornamented with a beautiful Cordova leather, and as large red damask
curtains, fastened back by gold clasps, floated before the window, he
perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated, and he began to turn
his head to the right and the left, upward and downward.
At this movement, which nobody opposed, he resumed a little courage, and
ventured to draw up one leg and then the other. At length, with the help
of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench, and found himself on
his feet.
At this moment an officer with a pleasant face opened a door, continued
to exchange some words with a person in the next chamber and then came
NA
NA
NA
NA
And he moved out of the way to let the mercer pass. The latter obeyed
without reply, and entered the chamber, where he appeared to be
expected.
It was a large cabinet, close and stifling, with the walls furnished
with arms offensive and defensive, and in which there was already a
fire, although it was scarcely the end of the month of September. A
square table, covered with books and papers, upon which was unrolled an
immense plan of the city of La Rochelle, occupied the center of the
room.
Standing before the chimney was a man of middle height, of a haughty,
proud mien; with piercing eyes, a large brow, and a thin face, which was
made still longer by a ROYAL (or IMPERIAL, as it is now called),
surmounted by a pair of mustaches. Although this man was scarcely
thirty-six or thirty-seven years of age, hair, mustaches, and royal, all
began to be gray. This man, except a sword, had all the appearance of a
soldier; and his buff boots, still slightly covered with dust, indicated
that he had been on horseback in the course of the day.
This man was Armand Jean Duplessis, Cardinal de Richelieu; not such as
he is now represented--broken down like an old man, suffering like a
martyr, his body bent, his voice failing, buried in a large armchair as
in an anticipated tomb; no longer living but by the strength of his
genius, and no longer maintaining the struggle with Europe but by the
eternal application of his thoughts--but such as he really was at this
period; that is to say, an active and gallant cavalier, already weak of
body, but sustained by that moral power which made of him one of the
most extraordinary men that ever lived, preparing, after having
supported the Duc de Nevers in his duchy of Mantua, after having taken
Nimes, Castres, and Uzes, to drive the English from the Isle of Re and
lay siege to La Rochelle.
At first sight, nothing denoted the cardinal; and it was impossible for
those who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they were.
The poor mercer remained standing at the door, while the eyes of the
personage we have just described were fixed upon him, and appeared to
wish to penetrate even into the depths of the past.

The officer took from the table the papers pointed out, gave them to him
who asked for them, bowed to the ground, and retired.
Bonacieux recognized in these papers his interrogatories of the
Bastille. From time to time the man by the chimney raised his eyes from
the writings, and plunged them like poniards into the heart of the poor
mercer.
At the end of ten minutes of reading and ten seconds of examination, the
cardinal was satisfied.

The cardinal repressed another smile.

At these words he took up a silver bell, and rang it; the officer
entered.

The officer sprang out of the apartment with that alacrity which all the
servants of the cardinal displayed in obeying him.

Five seconds has scarcely elapsed after the disappearance of the
officer, when the door opened, and a new personage entered.
NA
NA
NA
The cardinal rang a second time. The officer reappeared.
â€œPlace this man in the care of his guards again, and let him wait till I
NA
NA
deceived. This is quite another man, and does not resemble him at all.
NA
NA
The officer took Bonacieux by the arm, and led him into the antechamber,
where he found his two guards.
The newly introduced personage followed Bonacieux impatiently with his
eyes till he had gone out; and the moment the door closed, â€œThey have

The cardinal, being left alone, reflected for an instant and then rang
the bell a third time. The same officer appeared.
NA
M Bonacieux was introduced afresh, and upon a sign from the cardinal,
the officer retired.

The cardinal, however contemptible might be the triumph gained over so
vulgar a being as Bonacieux, did not the less enjoy it for an instant;
then, almost immediately, as if a fresh thought has occurred, a smile
played upon his lips, and he said, offering his hand to the mercer,
NA
â€œThe cardinal has touched me with his hand! I have touched the hand of

pleasantry. â€œBut you are able to have me arrested, you are able to have

And the cardinal made him a sign with his hand, to which Bonacieux
replied by bowing to the ground. He then went out backward, and when he
was in the antechamber the cardinal heard him, in his enthusiasm, crying
aloud, â€œLong life to the Monseigneur! Long life to his Eminence! Long

The Comte de Rochefort bowed like a man who acknowledges the superiority
of the master as great, and retired.
Left alone, the cardinal seated himself again and wrote a letter, which
he secured with his special seal. Then he rang. The officer entered for
the fourth time.

An instant after, the man he asked for was before him, booted and

The messenger, without replying a single word, bowed, took the letter,
with the order for the two hundred pistoles, and retired.
Here is what the letter contained:

As soon as these studs shall be in your possession, inform me.
15 MEN OF THE ROBE AND MEN OF THE SWORD
On the day after these events had taken place, Athos not having
reappeared, M. de Treville was informed by dâ€™Artagnan and Porthos of the
circumstance. As to Aramis, he had asked for leave of absence for five
days, and was gone, it was said, to Rouen on family business.
M de Treville was the father of his soldiers. The lowest or the least
known of them, as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company, was as
sure of his aid and support as if he had been his own brother.
He repaired, then, instantly to the office of the LIEUTENANT-CRIMINEL.
The officer who commanded the post of the Red Cross was sent for, and by
successive inquiries they learned that Athos was then lodged in Fort
lâ€™Eveque.
Athos had passed through all the examinations we have seen Bonacieux
undergo.
We were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted
with each other. Athos, who had till that time said nothing for fear
that dâ€™Artagnan, interrupted in his turn, should not have the time
necessary, from this moment declared that his name was Athos, and not
dâ€™Artagnan. He added that he did not know either M. or Mme. Bonacieux;
that he had never spoken to the one or the other; that he had come, at
about ten oâ€™clock in the evening, to pay a visit to his friend M.
dâ€™Artagnan, but that till that hour he had been at M. de Trevilleâ€™s,
NA
NA
M. le Duc de la Tremouille.
The second commissary was as much bewildered as the first had been by
the simple and firm declaration of the Musketeer, upon whom he was
anxious to take the revenge which men of the robe like at all times to
gain over men of the sword; but the name of M. de Treville, and that of
M. de la Tremouille, commanded a little reflection.
Athos was then sent to the cardinal; but unfortunately the cardinal was
at the Louvre with the king.
It was precisely at this moment that M. de Treville, on leaving the
residence of the LIEUTENANT-CRIMINEL and the governor of Fort lâ€™Eveque
without being able to find Athos, arrived at the palace.
As captain of the Musketeers, M. de Treville had the right of entry at
all times.
It is well known how violent the kingâ€™s prejudices were against the
queen, and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal,
who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men.
One of the grand causes of this prejudice was the friendship of Anne of
Austria for Mme. de Chevreuse. These two women gave him more uneasiness
than the war with Spain, the quarrel with England, or the embarrassment
of the finances. In his eyes and to his conviction, Mme. de Chevreuse
not only served the queen in her political intrigues, but, what
tormented him still more, in her amorous intrigues.
At the first word the cardinal spoke of Mme. de Chevreuse--who, though
exiled to Tours and believed to be in that city, had come to Paris,
remained there five days, and outwitted the police--the king flew into a
furious passion. Capricious and unfaithful, the king wished to be called
Louis the Just and Louis the Chaste. Posterity will find a difficulty in
understanding this character, which history explains only by facts and
never by reason.
But when the cardinal added that not only Mme. de Chevreuse had been in
Paris, but still further, that the queen had renewed with her one of
those mysterious correspondences which at that time was named a CABAL;
when he affirmed that he, the cardinal, was about to unravel the most
closely twisted thread of this intrigue; that at the moment of arresting
in the very act, with all the proofs about her, the queenâ€™s emissary to
the exiled duchess, a Musketeer had dared to interrupt the course of
justice violently, by falling sword in hand upon the honest men of the
law, charged with investigating impartially the whole affair in order to
place it before the eyes of the king--Louis XIII could not contain
himself, and he made a step toward the queenâ€™s apartment with that pale
and mute indignation which, when it broke out, led this prince to the
commission of the most pitiless cruelty. And yet, in all this, the
cardinal had not yet said a word about the Duke of Buckingham.
At this instant M. de Treville entered, cool, polite, and in
irreproachable costume.
Informed of what had passed by the presence of the cardinal and the
alteration in the kingâ€™s countenance, M. de Treville felt himself
something like Samson before the Philistines.
Louis XIII had already placed his hand on the knob of the door; at the
noise of M. de Trevilleâ€™s entrance he turned round. â€œYou arrive in good
NA

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
the same tone, â€œthat a party of PROCUREURS, commissaries, and men of the
police--very estimable people, but very inveterate, as it appears,
against the uniform--have taken upon themselves to arrest in a house, to
lead away through the open street, and throw into Fort lâ€™Eveque, all
upon an order which they have refused to show me, one of my, or rather
your Musketeers, sire, of irreproachable conduct, of an almost
illustrious reputation, and whom your Majesty knows favorably, Monsieur

return, when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege

The cardinal made the king a sign, which signified, â€œThat was on account

Treville bowed very respectfully, with a joy that was not unmixed with
fear; he would have preferred an obstinate resistance on the part of the

The king signed the order for release, and Treville carried it away
without delay. As he was about to leave the presence, the cardinal gave
him a friendly smile, and said, â€œA perfect harmony reigns, sire, between
the leaders and the soldiers of your Musketeers, which must be

As to the rest, M. de Treville had good reason to mistrust the cardinal

pleases, converse seriously. Sire, Buckingham has been in Paris five

It is impossible to form an idea of the impression these few words made
upon Louis XIII. He grew pale and red alternately; and the cardinal saw
at once that he had recovered by a single blow all the ground he had
lost.

And Louis XIII, opening the door of communication, passed into the
corridor which led from his apartments to those of Anne of Austria.
The queen was in the midst of her women--Mme. de Guitaut, Mme. de Sable,
Mme. de Montbazon, and Mme. de Guemene. In a corner was the Spanish
companion, Donna Estafania, who had followed her from Madrid. Mme.
Guemene was reading aloud, and everybody was listening to her with
attention with the exception of the queen, who had, on the contrary,
desired this reading in order that she might be able, while feigning to
listen, to pursue the thread of her own thoughts.
These thoughts, gilded as they were by a last reflection of love, were
not the less sad. Anne of Austria, deprived of the confidence of her
husband, pursued by the hatred of the cardinal, who could not pardon her
for having repulsed a more tender feeling, having before her eyes the
example of the queen-mother whom that hatred had tormented all her
life--though Marie de Medicis, if the memoirs of the time are to be
believed, had begun by according to the cardinal that sentiment which
Anne of Austria always refused him--Anne of Austria had seen her most
devoted servants fall around her, her most intimate confidants, her
dearest favorites. Like those unfortunate persons endowed with a fatal
gift, she brought misfortune upon everything she touched. Her friendship
was a fatal sign which called down persecution. Mme. de Chevreuse and
Mme. de Bernet were exiled, and Laporte did not conceal from his
mistress that he expected to be arrested every instant.
It was at the moment when she was plunged in the deepest and darkest of
these reflections that the door of the chamber opened, and the king
entered.
The reader hushed herself instantly. All the ladies rose, and there was
a profound silence. As to the king, he made no demonstration of

about to receive a visit from the chancellor, who will communicate
NA
The unfortunate queen, who was constantly threatened with divorce,
exile, and trial even, turned pale under her rouge, and could not
refrain from saying, â€œBut why this visit, sire? What can the chancellor
NA
The king turned upon his heel without reply, and almost at the same
instant the captain of the Guards, M. de Guitant, announced the visit of
the chancellor.
When the chancellor appeared, the king had already gone out by another
door.
The chancellor entered, half smiling, half blushing. As we shall
probably meet with him again in the course of our history, it may be
well for our readers to be made at once acquainted with him.
This chancellor was a pleasant man. He was Des Roches le Masle, canon of
Notre Dame, who had formerly been valet of a bishop, who introduced him
to his Eminence as a perfectly devout man. The cardinal trusted him, and
therein found his advantage.
There are many stories related of him, and among them this. After a wild
youth, he had retired into a convent, there to expiate, at least for
some time, the follies of adolescence. On entering this holy place, the
poor penitent was unable to shut the door so close as to prevent the
passions he fled from entering with him. He was incessantly attacked by
them, and the superior, to whom he had confided this misfortune, wishing
as much as in him lay to free him from them, had advised him, in order
to conjure away the tempting demon, to have recourse to the bell rope,
and ring with all his might. At the denunciating sound, the monks would
be rendered aware that temptation was besieging a brother, and all the
community would go to prayers.
This advice appeared good to the future chancellor. He conjured the evil
spirit with abundance of prayers offered up by the monks. But the devil
does not suffer himself to be easily dispossessed from a place in which
he has fixed his garrison. In proportion as they redoubled the exorcisms
he redoubled the temptations; so that day and night the bell was ringing
full swing, announcing the extreme desire for mortification which the
penitent experienced.
The monks had no longer an instant of repose. By day they did nothing
but ascend and descend the steps which led to the chapel; at night, in
addition to complines and matins, they were further obliged to leap
twenty times out of their beds and prostrate themselves on the floor of
their cells.
It is not known whether it was the devil who gave way, or the monks who
grew tired; but within three months the penitent reappeared in the world
with the reputation of being the most terrible POSSESSED that ever
existed.
On leaving the convent he entered into the magistracy, became president
on the place of his uncle, embraced the cardinalâ€™s party, which did not
prove want of sagacity, became chancellor, served his Eminence with zeal
in his hatred against the queen-mother and his vengeance against Anne of
Austria, stimulated the judges in the affair of Calais, encouraged the
attempts of M. de Laffemas, chief gamekeeper of France; then, at length,
invested with the entire confidence of the cardinal--a confidence which
he had so well earned--he received the singular commission for the
execution of which he presented himself in the queenâ€™s apartments.
The queen was still standing when he entered; but scarcely had she
perceived him then she reseated herself in her armchair, and made a sign
to her women to resume their cushions and stools, and with an air of
supreme hauteur, said, â€œWhat do you desire, monsieur, and with what
NA
â€œTo make, madame, in the name of the king, and without prejudice to the
respect which I have the honor to owe to your Majesty a close

â€œHow, monsieur, an investigation of my papers--mine! Truly, this is an

the instrument which the king employs. Has not his Majesty just left

NA
For formâ€™s sake the chancellor paid a visit to the pieces of furniture
named; but he well knew that it was not in a piece of furniture that the
queen would place the important letter she had written that day.
When the chancellor had opened and shut twenty times the drawers of the
secretaries, it became necessary, whatever hesitation he might
experience--it became necessary, I say, to come to the conclusion of the
affair; that is to say, to search the queen herself. The chancellor
advanced, therefore, toward Anne of Austria, and said with a very
perplexed and embarrassed air, â€œAnd now it remains for me to make the

NA
not willing to understand.
â€œHis majesty is certain that a letter has been written by you during the
day; he knows that it has not yet been sent to its address. This letter
is not in your table nor in your secretary; and yet this letter must be

drawing herself up to her full height, and fixing her eyes upon the
chancellor with an expression almost threatening.
â€œI am a faithful subject of the king, madame, and all that his Majesty

NA

â€œIf the king had desired that the letter should be given to him, madame,
he would have demanded it of you himself. But I repeat to you, I am

NA
NA
NA
â€œThat my orders go far, madame; and that I am authorized to seek for the
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
whom the imperious blood of Spain and Austria began to rise.
The chancellor made a profound reverence. Then, with the intention quite
patent of not drawing back a foot from the accomplishment of the
commission with which he was charged, and as the attendant of an
executioner might have done in the chamber of torture, he approached
Anne of Austria, from whose eyes at the same instant sprang tears of
rage.
The queen was, as we have said, of great beauty. The commission might
well be called delicate; and the king had reached, in his jealousy of
Buckingham, the point of not being jealous of anyone else.
Without doubt the chancellor Seguier looked about at that moment for the
rope of the famous bell; but not finding it he summoned his resolution,
and stretched forth his hands toward the place where the queen had
acknowledged the paper was to be found.
Anne of Austria took one step backward, became so pale that it might be
said she was dying, and leaning with her left hand upon a table behind
her to keep herself from falling, she with her right hand drew the paper
from her bosom and held it out to the keeper of the seals.
NA
and trembling voice; â€œtake it, and deliver me from your odious
NA
The chancellor, who, on his part, trembled with an emotion easily to be
conceived, took the letter, bowed to the ground, and retired. The door
was scarcely closed upon him, when the queen sank, half fainting, into
the arms of her women.
The chancellor carried the letter to the king without having read a
single word of it. The king took it with a trembling hand, looked for
the address, which was wanting, became very pale, opened it slowly, then
seeing by the first words that it was addressed to the King of Spain, he
read it rapidly.
It was nothing but a plan of attack against the cardinal. The queen
pressed her brother and the Emperor of Austria to appear to be wounded,
as they really were, by the policy of Richelieu--the eternal object of
which was the abasement of the house of Austria--to declare war against
France, and as a condition of peace, to insist upon the dismissal of the
cardinal; but as to love, there was not a single word about it in all
the letter.
The king, quite delighted, inquired if the cardinal was still at the
Louvre; he was told that his Eminence awaited the orders of his Majesty
in the business cabinet.
The king went straight to him.
NA
intrigue is political, and there is not the least question of love in

The cardinal took the letter, and read it with the greatest attention;
then, when he had arrived at the end of it, he read it a second time.

Monsieur de Conde, Monsieur de Bassopierre, or some valiant gentleman
whose business is war, and not me, who am a churchman, and who am

your Majesty on the side of your honor, it would be quite another thing,
and I should be the first to say, â€˜No grace, sire--no grace for the

Thereupon the cardinal, hearing the clock strike eleven, bowed low,
asking permission of the king to retire, and supplicating him to come to
a good understanding with the queen.
Anne of Austria, who, in consequence of the seizure of her letter,
expected reproaches, was much astonished the next day to see the king
make some attempts at reconciliation with her. Her first movement was
repellent. Her womanly pride and her queenly dignity had both been so
cruelly offended that she could not come round at the first advance;
but, overpersuaded by the advice of her women, she at last had the
appearance of beginning to forget. The king took advantage of this
favorable moment to tell her that he had the intention of shortly giving
a fete.
A fete was so rare a thing for poor Anne of Austria that at this
announcement, as the cardinal had predicted, the last trace of her
resentment disappeared, if not from her heart, at least from her
countenance. She asked upon what day this fete would take place, but the
king replied that he must consult the cardinal upon that head.
Indeed, every day the king asked the cardinal when this fete should take
place; and every day the cardinal, under some pretext, deferred fixing
it. Ten days passed away thus.
On the eighth day after the scene we have described, the cardinal
received a letter with the London stamp which only contained these
lines: â€œI have them; but I am unable to leave London for want of money.
Send me five hundred pistoles, and four or five days after I have

On the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his
customary question to him.
Richelieu counted on his fingers, and said to himself, â€œShe will arrive,
she says, four or five days after having received the money. It will
require four or five days for the transmission of the money, four or
five days for her to return; that makes ten days. Now, allowing for
contrary winds, accidents, and a womanâ€™s weakness, there are twelve

Majesty the evening before the fete that you should like to see how her

17 BONACIEUX AT HOME
It was the second time the cardinal had mentioned these diamond studs to
the king. Louis XIII was struck with this insistence, and began to fancy
that this recommendation concealed some mystery.
More than once the king had been humiliated by the cardinal, whose
police, without having yet attained the perfection of the modern police,
were excellent, being better informed than himself, even upon what was
going on in his own household. He hoped, then, in a conversation with
Anne of Austria, to obtain some information from that conversation, and
afterward to come upon his Eminence with some secret which the cardinal
either knew or did not know, but which, in either case, would raise him
infinitely in the eyes of his minister.
He went then to the queen, and according to custom accosted her with
fresh menaces against those who surrounded her. Anne of Austria lowered
her head, allowed the torrent to flow on without replying, hoping that
it would cease of itself; but this was not what Louis XIII meant. Louis
XIII wanted a discussion from which some light or other might break,
convinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was
preparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his Eminence was
so skillful in getting up. He arrived at this end by his persistence in
accusation.
NA
you do not tell me all that you have in your heart. What have I done,
then? Let me know what crime I have committed. It is impossible that
your Majesty can make all this ado about a letter written to my

The king, attacked in a manner so direct, did not know what to answer;
and he thought that this was the moment for expressing the desire which
he was not going to have made until the evening before the fete.

The answer was terrible. Anne of Austria believed that Louis XIII knew
all, and that the cardinal had persuaded him to employ this long
dissimulation of seven or eight days, which, likewise, was
characteristic. She became excessively pale, leaned her beautiful hand
upon a CONSOLE, which hand appeared then like one of wax, and looking at
the king with terror in her eyes, she was unable to reply by a single
syllable.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The queenâ€™s paleness, if possible, increased; the king perceived it, and
enjoyed it with that cold cruelty which was one of the worst sides of
his character.
NA
NA
NA
Louis XIII felt instinctively that he ought not to reply to this
question, the queen having put it in an almost dying voice.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, and what does it signify whether it was he or I? Is there any

The queen made a curtsy, less from etiquette than because her knees were
sinking under her. The king went away enchanted.
NA

NA
She knelt upon a cushion and prayed, with her head buried between her
palpitating arms.
In fact, her position was terrible. Buckingham had returned to London;
Mme. de Chevreuse was at Tours. More closely watched than ever, the
queen felt certain, without knowing how to tell which, that one of her
women had betrayed her. Laporte could not leave the Louvre; she had not
a soul in the world in whom she could confide. Thus, while contemplating
the misfortune which threatened her and the abandonment in which she was
left, she broke out into sobs and tears.
NA
sweetness and pity.
The queen turned sharply round, for there could be no deception in the
expression of that voice; it was a friend who spoke thus.
In fact, at one of the doors which opened into the queenâ€™s apartment
appeared the pretty Mme. Bonacieux. She had been engaged in arranging
the dresses and linen in a closet when the king entered; she could not
get out and had heard all.
The queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprised--for in
her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been
given to her by Laporte.
NA
weeping herself at the queenâ€™s sorrows; â€œI am your Majestyâ€™s, body and
soul, and however far I may be from you, however inferior may be my
position, I believe I have discovered a means of extricating your

This expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart, and, like the
first, there was no mistaking it.

The queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion,
gazed at her as if to read her very heart, and, seeing nothing but
sincerity in her beautiful eyes, embraced her tenderly.
NA
NA
â€œDo not exaggerate the service I have the happiness to render your
Majesty. I have nothing to save for your Majesty; you are only the

The queen ran to a little table, on which were ink, paper, and pens. She
wrote two lines, sealed the letter with her private seal, and gave it to
Mme. Bonacieux.
NA
NA
NA
Mme. Bonacieux blushed.
NA
NA
NA
â€œHe has some, but he is very avaricious; that is his fault.

NA
NA
Mme. Bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen, concealed the paper in the
bosom of her dress, and disappeared with the lightness of a bird.
Ten minutes afterward she was at home. As she told the queen, she had
not seen her husband since his liberation; she was ignorant of the
change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal--a
change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from the
Comte de Rochefort, who had become the best friend of Bonacieux, and had
persuaded him, without much trouble, that no culpable sentiments had
prompted the abduction of his wife, but that it was only a political
precaution.
She found M. Bonacieux alone; the poor man was recovering with
difficulty the order in his house, in which he had found most of the
furniture broken and the closets nearly emptied--justice not being one
of the three things which King Solomon names as leaving no traces of
their passage. As to the servant, she had run away at the moment of her
masterâ€™s arrest. Terror had had such an effect upon the poor girl that
she had never ceased walking from Paris till she reached Burgundy, her
native place.
The worthy mercer had, immediately upon re-entering his house, informed
his wife of his happy return, and his wife had replied by congratulating
him, and telling him that the first moment she could steal from her
duties should be devoted to paying him a visit.
This first moment had been delayed five days, which, under any other
circumstances, might have appeared rather long to M. Bonacieux; but he
had, in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits
Rochefort had made him, ample subjects for reflection, and as everybody
knows, nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection.
This was the more so because Bonacieuxâ€™s reflections were all
rose-colored. Rochefort called him his friend, his dear Bonacieux, and
never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him.
The mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and
fortune.
On her side Mme. Bonacieux had also reflected; but, it must be admitted,
upon something widely different from ambition. In spite of herself her
thoughts constantly reverted to that handsome young man who was so brave
and appeared to be so much in love. Married at eighteen to M. Bonacieux,
having always lived among her husbandâ€™s friends--people little capable
of inspiring any sentiment whatever in a young woman whose heart was
above her position--Mme. Bonacieux had remained insensible to vulgar
seductions; but at this period the title of gentleman had great
influence with the citizen class, and dâ€™Artagnan was a gentleman.
Besides, he wore the uniform of the Guards, which, next to that of the
Musketeers, was most admired by the ladies. He was, we repeat, handsome,
young, and bold; he spoke of love like a man who did love and was
anxious to be loved in return. There was certainly enough in all this to
turn a head only twenty-three years old, and Mme. Bonacieux had just
attained that happy period of life.
The couple, then, although they had not seen each other for eight days,
and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were
concerned, accosted each other with a degree of preoccupation.
Nevertheless, Bonacieux manifested real joy, and advanced toward his
wife with open arms. Madame Bonacieux presented her cheek to him.

â€œI heard of it the day it happened; but as you were not guilty of any

him on his weak side. But a man, were he even a mercer, when he had
talked for ten minutes with Cardinal Richelieu, is no longer the same
man.

Bonacieux was repeating, word for word, a sentence which he had heard
from the Comte de Rochefort; but the poor wife, who had reckoned on her
husband, and who, in that hope, had answered for him to the queen, did
not tremble the less, both at the danger into which she had nearly cast
herself and at the helpless state to which she was reduced.
Nevertheless, knowing the weakness of her husband, and more particularly
his cupidity, she did not despair of bringing him round to her purpose.

Bonacieux was cowardly and avaricious, but he loved his wife. He was

Bonacieux fell into a profound reflection. He weighed the two angers in
his brain--that of the cardinal and that of the queen; that of the

At once Mme. Bonacieux saw that she had gone too far, and she was
terrified at having communicated so much. She for a moment contemplated
with fright that stupid countenance, impressed with the invincible
resolution of a fool that is overcome by fear.

But the more the young woman excused herself, the more important
Bonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to him. He
resolved then to hasten immediately to the residence of the Comte de

send to London.

Mme. Bonacieux looked at the young man, restrained for a minute by a
last hesitation; but there was such an ardor in his eyes, such
persuasion in his voice, that she felt herself constrained to confide in
him. Besides, she found herself in circumstances where everything must
be risked for the sake of everything. The queen might be as much injured

decided her to speak.

Mme. Bonacieux pronounced these words with tears in her eyes. Dâ€™Artagnan
saw those tears, and much disturbed, softened, he threw himself at her
feet.
â€œWith me you will be as safe as in a temple; I give you my word of a
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan drew back the bolt with precaution, and both, light as
shadows, glided through the interior door into the passage, ascended the
stairs as quietly as possible, and entered dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s chambers.
Once there, for greater security, the young man barricaded the door.
They both approached the window, and through a slit in the shutter they
saw Bonacieux talking with a man in a cloak.
At sight of this man, dâ€™Artagnan started, and half drawing his sword,
sprang toward the door.
It was the man of Meung.
NA
NA
NA
â€œYour life is devoted from this moment, and does not belong to you. In
the name of the queen I forbid you to throw yourself into any peril
NA
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan drew near the window, and lent his ear.
M Bonacieux had opened his door, and seeing the apartment, had returned
to the man in the cloak, whom he had left alone for an instant.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI do not think he is; as you see, his shutter is closed, and you can
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Bonacieux re-entered the house, passed through the same door that had
afforded a passage for the two fugitives, went up to dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s door,
and knocked.
No one answered. Porthos, in order to make a greater display, had that
evening borrowed Planchet. As to dâ€™Artagnan, he took care not to give
the least sign of existence.
The moment the hand of Bonacieux sounded on the door, the two young
people felt their hearts bound within them.
NA
â€œNever mind. Let us return to your apartment. We shall be safer there
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan raised the three or four boards which made his chamber
another ear of Dionysius, spread a carpet on the floor, went upon his
knees, and made a sign to Mme. Bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the
opening.

NA
The stranger went out.
NA
NA
A terrible howling interrupted these reflections of dâ€™Artagnan and Mme.
Bonacieux. It was her husband, who had discovered the disappearance of
NA
NA
Bonacieux called a long time; but as such cries, on account of their
frequency, brought nobody in the Rue des Fossoyeurs, and as lately the
mercerâ€™s house had a bad name, finding that nobody came, he went out
continuing to call, his voice being heard fainter and fainter as he went
in the direction of the Rue du Bac.
NA
â€œCourage, my friend, but above all, prudence, and think what you owe to

The young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her
cheeks. A few seconds afterward dâ€™Artagnan also went out enveloped in a
large cloak, which ill-concealed the sheath of a long sword.
Mme. Bonacieux followed him with her eyes, with that long, fond look
with which he had turned the angle of the street, she fell on her knees,

19 PLAN OF CAMPAIGN
Dâ€™Artagnan went straight to M. de Trevilleâ€™s. He had reflected that in a
few minutes the cardinal would be warned by this cursed stranger, who
appeared to be his agent, and he judged, with reason, he had not a
moment to lose.
The heart of the young man overflowed with joy. An opportunity presented
itself to him in which there would be at the same time glory to be
acquired, and money to be gained; and as a far higher encouragement, it
brought him into close intimacy with a woman he adored. This chance did,
then, for him at once more than he would have dared to ask of
Providence.
M de Treville was in his saloon with his habitual court of gentlemen.
Dâ€™Artagnan, who was known as a familiar of the house, went straight to
his office, and sent word that he wished to see him on something of
importance.
Dâ€™Artagnan had been there scarcely five minutes when M. de Treville
entered. At the first glance, and by the joy which was painted on his
countenance, the worthy captain plainly perceived that something new was
on foot.
All the way along dâ€™Artagnan had been consulting with himself whether he
should place confidence in M. de Treville, or whether he should only ask
him to give him CARTE BLANCHE for some secret affair. But M. de Treville
had always been so thoroughly his friend, had always been so devoted to
the king and queen, and hated the cardinal so cordially, that the young
man resolved to tell him everything.

â€œWe are sworn, once for all, to implicit confidence and devotedness
against all proof. Besides, you can tell them that you have full

â€œI can send to each of them leave of absence for fifteen days, that is

first write your request to Dessessart. Perhaps you had a spy at your
heels; and your visit, if it should ever be known to the cardinal, will

Dâ€™Artagnan drew up his request, and M. de Treville, on receiving it,
assured him that by two oâ€™clock in the morning the four leaves of
absence should be at the respective domiciles of the travelers.
â€œHave the goodness to send mine to Athosâ€™s residence. I should dread
NA
NA
Treville, calling him back.
Dâ€™Artagnan returned.
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket.
NA
NA
â€œOh, plenty! That would carry you to the end of the world. Begone,
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan saluted M. de Treville, who held out his hand to him;
dâ€™Artagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude. Since his
first arrival at Paris, he had had constant occasion to honor this
excellent man, whom he had always found worthy, loyal, and great.
His first visit was to Aramis, at whose residence he had not been since
the famous evening on which he had followed Mme. Bonacieux. Still
further, he had seldom seen the young Musketeer; but every time he had
seen him, he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance.
This evening, especially, Aramis was melancholy and thoughtful.
Dâ€™Artagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy. Aramis
pleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of St.
Augustine, which he was forced to write in Latin for the following week,
and which preoccupied him a good deal.
After the two friends had been chatting a few moments, a servant from M.
de Treville entered, bringing a sealed packet.
NA
NA
NA
NA
there is a demipistole for your trouble; you will tell Monsieur de
NA
The lackey bowed to the ground and departed.
NA
NA
NA
Aramis stopped.
NA
NA
NA
NA
as death.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œTo Tours? Yes, that may be. You evidently know her. But why did she
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
despised, betrayed. I was so delighted to see her again! I could not
have believed she would risk her liberty for me, and yet for what other

NA
NA
â€œOh, youâ€™ll know it someday, Aramis; but at present I must imitate the

Aramis smiled, as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a
certain evening. â€œWell, then, since she has left Paris, and you are sure
of it, dâ€™Artagnan, nothing prevents me, and I am ready to follow you.
NA
â€œTo see Athos now, and if you will come thither, I beg you to make
NA
NA
â€œPerhaps so. At all events, it is best that he should follow us to
NA
Aramis called Bazin, and, after having ordered him to join them at
NA
cloak, sword, and three pistols, opening uselessly two or three drawers
to see if he could not find stray coin. When well assured this search
was superfluous, he followed dâ€™Artagnan, wondering to himself how this
young Guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had
given hospitality, and that he should know better than himself what had
become of her.
Only as they went out Aramis placed his hand upon the arm of dâ€™Artagnan,
NA
he.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Tranquil on this important point, Aramis continued his way with
dâ€™Artagnan, and both soon arrived at Athosâ€™s dwelling. They found him
holding his leave of absence in one hand, and M. de Trevilleâ€™s note in
the other.
â€œCan you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this
NA
My dear Athos,
I wish, as your health absolutely requires it, that you should rest for
a fortnight. Go, then, and take the waters of Forges, or any that may be
more agreeable to you, and recuperate yourself as quickly as possible.
Yours affectionate,
de Treville
â€œWell, this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow

NA

jauntily, â€˜Gentlemen, there is fighting going on in Gascony or in

pistoles which came from I donâ€™t know where. So let us go and get killed

Each Musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general hotel, as at a
barrack, his own horse and that of his lackey. Planchet, Grimaud,

Each one, stretching out his hand to the bag, took his seventy-five
pistoles, and made his preparations to set out at the time appointed.
20 THE JOURNEY
At two oâ€™clock in the morning, our four adventurers left Paris by the
Barriere St. Denis. As long as it was dark they remained silent; in
spite of themselves they submitted to the influence of the obscurity,
and apprehended ambushes on every side.
With the first rays of day their tongues were loosened; with the sun
gaiety revived. It was like the eve of a battle; the heart beat, the
eyes laughed, and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to
lose, was, after all, a good thing.
Besides, the appearance of the caravan was formidable. The black horses
of the Musketeers, their martial carriage, with the regimental step of
these noble companions of the soldier, would have betrayed the most
strict incognito. The lackeys followed, armed to the teeth.
All went well till they arrived at Chantilly, which they reached about
eight oâ€™clock in the morning. They needed breakfast, and alighted at the
door of an AUBERGE, recommended by a sign representing St. Martin giving
half his cloak to a poor man. They ordered the lackeys not to unsaddle
the horses, and to hold themselves in readiness to set off again
immediately.
They entered the common hall, and placed themselves at table. A
gentleman, who had just arrived by the route of Dammartin, was seated at
the same table, and was breakfasting. He opened the conversation about
rain and fine weather; the travelers replied. He drank to their good
health, and the travelers returned his politeness.
But at the moment Mousqueton came to announce that the horses were
ready, and they were arising from table, the stranger proposed to
Porthos to drink the health of the cardinal. Porthos replied that he
asked no better if the stranger, in his turn, would drink the health of
the king. The stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his
Eminence. Porthos called him drunk, and the stranger drew his sword.
NA
helped; there is no drawing back. Kill the fellow, and rejoin us as soon
NA
All three remounted their horses, and set out at a good pace, while
Porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the
thrusts known in the fencing schools.
NA
NA
asked Aramis.
â€œBecause, as Porthos was talking louder than the rest of us, he took him
NA
NA
murmured Athos; and the travelers continued their route.
At Beauvais they stopped two hours, as well to breathe their horses a
little as to wait for Porthos. At the end of two hours, as Porthos did
not come, not any news of him, they resumed their journey.
At a league from Beauvais, where the road was confined between two high
banks, they fell in with eight or ten men who, taking advantage of the
road being unpaved in this spot, appeared to be employed in digging
holes and filling up the ruts with mud.
Aramis, not liking to soil his boots with this artificial mortar,
apostrophized them rather sharply. Athos wished to restrain him, but it
was too late. The laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their
insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool Athos, who urged on
his horse against one of them.
Then each of these men retreated as far as the ditch, from which each
took a concealed musket; the result was that our seven travelers were
outnumbered in weapons. Aramis received a ball which passed through his
shoulder, and Mousqueton another ball which lodged in the fleshy part
which prolongs the lower portion of the loins. Therefore Mousqueton
alone fell from his horse, not because he was severely wounded, but not
being able to see the wound, he judged it to be more serious than it
really was.
NA
NA
Aramis, wounded as he was, seized the mane of his horse, which carried
him on with the others. Mousquetonâ€™s horse rejoined them, and galloped
by the side of his companions.
NA
NA
by a ball. By my faith, it is very fortunate that the letter was not in

NA
NA
said Athos. â€œMy opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not

They continued at their best speed for two hours, although the horses
were so fatigued that it was to be feared they would soon refuse
service.
The travelers had chosen crossroads in the hope that they might meet
with less interruption; but at Crevecoeur, Aramis declared he could
proceed no farther. In fact, it required all the courage which he
concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so
far. He grew more pale every minute, and they were obliged to support
him on his horse. They lifted him off at the door of a cabaret, left
Bazin with him, who, besides, in a skirmish was more embarrassing than
useful, and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at Amiens.
NA
two masters and Grimaud and Planchet! MORBLEU! I wonâ€™t be their dupe, I
will answer for it. I will neither open my mouth nor draw my sword
NA
NA
NA
And the travelers buried their rowels in their horsesâ€™ flanks, who thus
vigorously stimulated recovered their energies. They arrived at Amiens
at midnight, and alighted at the AUBERGE of the Golden Lily.
The host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth. He
received the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton
nightcap in the other. He wished to lodge the two travelers each in a
charming chamber; but unfortunately these charming chambers were at the
opposite extremities of the hotel. Dâ€™Artagnan and Athos refused them.
The host replied that he had no other worthy of their Excellencies; but
the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber, each on a
mattress which might be thrown upon the ground. The host insisted; but
the travelers were firm, and he was obliged to do as they wished.
They had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within, when
someone knocked at the yard shutter; they demanded who was there, and
recognizing the voices of their lackeys, opened the shutter. It was
indeed Planchet and Grimaud.
NA
willing, gentlemen, I will sleep across your doorway, and you will then
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Planchet mounted by the window and installed himself across the doorway,
while Grimaud went and shut himself up in the stable, undertaking that
by five oâ€™clock in the morning he and the four horses should be ready.
The night was quiet enough. Toward two oâ€™clock in the morning somebody
endeavored to open the door; but as Planchet awoke in an instant and
NA
away.
At four oâ€™clock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the
stables. Grimaud had tried to waken the stable boys, and the stable boys
had beaten him. When they opened the window, they saw the poor lad lying
senseless, with his head split by a blow with a pitchfork.
Planchet went down into the yard, and wished to saddle the horses; but
the horses were all used up. Mousquetonâ€™s horse which had traveled for
five or six hours without a rider the day before, might have been able
to pursue the journey; but by an inconceivable error the veterinary
surgeon, who had been sent for, as it appeared, to bleed one of the
hostâ€™s horses, had bled Mousquetonâ€™s.
This began to be annoying. All these successive accidents were perhaps
the result of chance; but they might be the fruits of a plot. Athos and
dâ€™Artagnan went out, while Planchet was sent to inquire if there were
not three horses for sale in the neighborhood. At the door stood two
horses, fresh, strong, and fully equipped. These would just have suited
them. He asked where their masters were, and was informed that they had
passed the night in the inn, and were then settling their bill with the
host.
Athos went down to pay the reckoning, while dâ€™Artagnan and Planchet
stood at the street door. The host was in a lower and back room, to
which Athos was requested to go.
Athos entered without the least mistrust, and took out two pistoles to
pay the bill. The host was alone, seated before his desk, one of the
drawers of which was partly open. He took the money which Athos offered
to him, and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands,
suddenly cried out that it was bad, and that he would have him and his
companions arrested as forgers.
NA
NA
At the same instant, four men, armed to the teeth, entered by side
doors, and rushed upon Athos.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan and Planchet did not require twice bidding; they unfastened
the two horses that were waiting at the door, leaped upon them, buried
their spurs in their sides, and set off at full gallop.
NA
they galloped on.
NA
and he appeared to me, through the glass door, to be fighting with his
NA
NA
to leave him; maybe the same fate awaits us two paces hence. Forward,
NA
NA
NA
And both, with free use of the spur, arrived at St. Omer without drawing
bit. At St. Omer they breathed their horses with the bridles passed
under their arms for fear of accident, and ate a morsel from their hands
on the stones of the street, after they departed again.
At a hundred paces from the gates of Calais, dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s horse gave
out, and could not by any means be made to get up again, the blood
flowing from his eyes and his nose. There still remained Planchetâ€™s
horse; but he stopped short, and could not be made to move a step.
Fortunately, as we have said, they were within a hundred paces of the
city; they left their two nags upon the high road, and ran toward the
quay. Planchet called his masterâ€™s attention to a gentleman who had just
arrived with his lackey, and only preceded them by about fifty paces.
They made all speed to come up to this gentleman, who appeared to be in
great haste. His boots were covered with dust, and he inquired if he
could not instantly cross over to England.
NA
sail, â€œbut this morning came an order to let no one leave without
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAt a quarter of a league from the city. Look, you may see it from
NA
NA
to the governorâ€™s country house.
Dâ€™Artagnan and Planchet followed the gentleman at a distance of five
hundred paces. Once outside the city, dâ€™Artagnan overtook the gentleman
as he was entering a little wood.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI have performed that same distance in forty hours, and by ten oâ€™clock
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, then, I wish that order of which you are bearer, seeing that I
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œMy brave young man, I will blow out your brains. HOLA, Lubin, my
NA
NA
NA
Planchet, emboldened by the first exploit, sprang upon Lubin; and being
strong and vigorous, he soon got him on the broad of his back, and
placed his knee upon his breast.
NA
NA
Seeing this, the gentleman drew his sword, and sprang upon dâ€™Artagnan;
but he had too strong an adversary. In three seconds dâ€™Artagnan had
wounded him three times, exclaiming at each thrust, â€œOne for Athos, one
NA
At the third hit the gentleman fell like a log. Dâ€™Artagnan believed him
to be dead, or at least insensible, and went toward him for the purpose
of taking the order; but the moment he extended his hand to search for
it, the wounded man, who had not dropped his sword, plunged the point
NA
NA
him to the earth with a fourth thrust through his body.
This time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted. Dâ€™Artagnan searched
his pockets, and took from one of them the order for the passage. It was
in the name of Comte de Wardes.
Then, casting a glance on the handsome young man, who was scarcely
twenty-five years of age, and whom he was leaving in his gore, deprived
of sense and perhaps dead, he gave a sigh for that unaccountable destiny
which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of people who
are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist.
But he was soon aroused from these reflections by Lubin, who uttered
loud cries and screamed for help with all his might.
Planchet grasped him by the throat, and pressed as hard as he could.
NA
cry, Iâ€™ll be bound; but as soon as I let go he will howl again. I know
NA
In fact, tightly held as he was, Lubin endeavored still to cry out.
NA
NA
This being properly done, they drew the Comte de Wardes close to his
servant; and as night was approaching, and as the wounded man and the
bound man were at some little distance within the wood, it was evident
they were likely to remain there till the next day.
NA
NA
â€œOh, thatâ€™s nothing! Let us attend to what is more pressing first, and
then we will attend to my wound; besides, it does not seem very
NA
And they both set forward as fast as they could toward the country house
of the worthy functionary.
The Comte de Wardes was announced, and dâ€™Artagnan was introduced.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œIt appears that his Eminence is anxious to prevent someone from
NA
â€œYes; a certain dâ€™Artagnan, a Bearnese gentleman who left Paris in
company with three of his friends, with the intention of going to
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
And dâ€™Artagnan gave, feature for feature, a description of the Comte de
Wardes.
NA
NA
â€œWe will keep a sharp lookout for them; and if we lay hands on them his
Eminence may be assured they will be reconducted to Paris under a good
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Delighted with this assurance the governor countersigned the passport
and delivered it to dâ€™Artagnan. Dâ€™Artagnan lost no time in useless
compliments. He thanked the governor, bowed, and departed. Once outside,
he and Planchet set off as fast as they could; and by making a long
detour avoided the wood and reentered the city by another gate.
The vessel was quite ready to sail, and the captain was waiting on the
NA
NA
â€œAnd that other gentleman?
NA
NA
NA
NA
He leaped with Planchet into the boat, and five minutes after they were
on board. It was time; for they had scarcely sailed half a league, when
dâ€™Artagnan saw a flash and heard a detonation. It was the cannon which
announced the closing of the port.
He had now leisure to look to his wound. Fortunately, as dâ€™Artagnan had
thought, it was not dangerous. The point of the sword had touched a rib,
and glanced along the bone. Still further, his shirt had stuck to the
wound, and he had lost only a few drops of blood.
Dâ€™Artagnan was worn out with fatigue. A mattress was laid upon the deck
for him. He threw himself upon it, and fell asleep.
On the morrow, at break of day, they were still three or four leagues
from the coast of England. The breeze had been so light all night, they
had made but little progress. At ten oâ€™clock the vessel cast anchor in
the harbor of Dover, and at half past ten dâ€™Artagnan placed his foot on
NA
But that was not all; they must get to London. In England the post was
well served. Dâ€™Artagnan and Planchet took each a post horse, and a
postillion rode before them. In a few hours they were in the capital.
Dâ€™Artagnan did not know London; he did not know a word of English; but
he wrote the name of Buckingham on a piece of paper, and everyone
pointed out to him the way to the dukeâ€™s hotel.
The duke was at Windsor hunting with the king. Dâ€™Artagnan inquired for
the confidential valet of the duke, who, having accompanied him in all
his voyages, spoke French perfectly well; he told him that he came from
Paris on an affair of life and death, and that he must speak with his
master instantly.
The confidence with which dâ€™Artagnan spoke convinced Patrick, which was
the name of this minister of the minister. He ordered two horses to be
saddled, and himself went as guide to the young Guardsman. As for
Planchet, he had been lifted from his horse as stiff as a rush; the poor
ladâ€™s strength was almost exhausted. Dâ€™Artagnan seemed iron.
On their arrival at the castle they learned that Buckingham and the king
were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues away. In twenty minutes
they were on the spot named. Patrick soon caught the sound of his
masterâ€™s voice calling his falcon.

Patrick galloped off, reached the duke, and announced to him in the
terms directed that a messenger awaited him.
Buckingham at once remembered the circumstance, and suspecting that
something was going on in France of which it was necessary he should be
informed, he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was, and
recognizing from afar the uniform of the Guards, he put his horse into a
gallop, and rode straight up to dâ€™Artagnan. Patrick discreetly kept in
the background.

21 THE COUNTESS DE WINTER
As they rode along, the duke endeavored to draw from dâ€™Artagnan, not all
that had happened, but what dâ€™Artagnan himself knew. By adding all that
he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances, he was
enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the seriousness of
which, for the rest, the queenâ€™s letter, short but explicit, gave him
the clue. But that which astonished him most was that the cardinal, so
deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in
England, had not succeeded in arresting him on the road. It was then,
upon the manifestation of this astonishment, that dâ€™Artagnan related to
him the precaution taken, and how, thanks to the devotion of his three
friends, whom he had left scattered and bleeding on the road, he had
succeeded in coming off with a single sword thrust, which had pierced
the queenâ€™s letter and for which he had repaid M. de Wardes with such
terrible coin. While he was listening to this recital, delivered with
the greatest simplicity, the duke looked from time to time at the young
man with astonishment, as if he could not comprehend how so much
prudence, courage, and devotedness could be allied with a countenance
which indicated not more than twenty years.
The horses went like the wind, and in a few minutes they were at the
gates of London. Dâ€™Artagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke
would slacken his pace, but it was not so. He kept on his way at the
same rate, heedless about upsetting those whom he met on the road. In
fact, in crossing the city two or three accidents of this kind happened;
but Buckingham did not even turn his head to see what became of those he
had knocked down. Dâ€™Artagnan followed him amid cries which strongly
resembled curses.
On entering the court of his hotel, Buckingham sprang from his horse,
and without thinking what became of the animal, threw the bridle on his
neck, and sprang toward the vestibule. Dâ€™Artagnan did the same, with a
little more concern, however, for the noble creatures, whose merits he
fully appreciated; but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four
grooms run from the kitchens and the stables, and busy themselves with
the steeds.
The duke walked so fast that dâ€™Artagnan had some trouble in keeping up
with him. He passed through several apartments, of an elegance of which
even the greatest nobles of France had not even an idea, and arrived at
length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of
richness. In the alcove of this chamber was a door concealed in the
tapestry which the duke opened with a little gold key which he wore
suspended from his neck by a chain of the same metal. With discretion
dâ€™Artagnan remained behind; but at the moment when Buckingham crossed
the threshold, he turned round, and seeing the hesitation of the young
NA
NA
Encouraged by this invitation, dâ€™Artagnan followed the duke, who closed
the door after them. The two found themselves in a small chapel covered
with a tapestry of Persian silk worked with gold, and brilliantly
lighted with a vast number of candles. Over a species of altar, and
beneath a canopy of blue velvet, surmounted by white and red plumes, was
a full-length portrait of Anne of Austria, so perfect in its resemblance
that dâ€™Artagnan uttered a cry of surprise on beholding it. One might
believe the queen was about to speak. On the altar, and beneath the
portrait, was the casket containing the diamond studs.
The duke approached the altar, knelt as a priest might have done before

he was about to part. All at once he uttered a terrible cry.

The valet went out with a mute promptitude which showed him accustomed
to obey blindly and without reply.
But although the jeweler had been mentioned first, it was the secretary
who first made his appearance. This was simply because he lived in the
hotel. He found Buckingham seated at a table in his bedchamber, writing
orders with his own hand.

Dâ€™Artagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the
unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king in
the prosecution of his intrigues. Buckingham saw by the expression of
the young manâ€™s face what was passing in his mind, and he smiled.

richly paid for that obedience? It was to that obedience I owe her
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the
destinies of nations and the lives of men are suspended. He was lost in
these reflections when the goldsmith entered. He was an Irishman--one of
the most skillful of his craft, and who himself confessed that he gained
a hundred thousand livres a year by the Duke of Buckingham.

The goldsmith cast a glance at the elegant manner in which they were
set, calculated, one with another, what the diamonds were worth, and

The goldsmith knew the duke. He knew all objection would be useless, and
instantly determined how to act.
NA
â€œOh, you may even see her if you like, my dear Mr. Oâ€™Reilly. Your
captivity shall be mild, be assured; and as every inconvenience deserves
its indemnification, here is, in addition to the price of the studs, an
order for a thousand pistoles, to make you forget the annoyance I cause
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan could not get over the surprise created in him by this
minister, who thus open-handed, sported with men and millions.
As to the goldsmith, he wrote to his wife, sending her the order for the
thousand pistoles, and charging her to send him, in exchange, his most
skillful apprentice, an assortment of diamonds, of which he gave the
names and the weight, and the necessary tools.
Buckingham conducted the goldsmith to the chamber destined for him, and
which, at the end of half an hour, was transformed into a workshop. Then
he placed a sentinel at each door, with an order to admit nobody upon
any pretense but his VALET DE CHAMBRE, Patrick. We need not add that the
goldsmith, Oâ€™Reilly, and his assistant, were prohibited from going out
under any pretext. This point, settled, the duke turned to dâ€™Artagnan.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Buckingham gave dâ€™Artagnan a chamber adjoining his own. He wished to
have the young man at hand--not that he at all mistrusted him, but for
the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the
queen.
In one hour after, the ordinance was published in London that no vessel
bound for France should leave port, not even the packet boat with
letters. In the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between
the two kingdoms.
On the day after the morrow, by eleven oâ€™clock, the two diamond studs
were finished, and they were so completely imitated, so perfectly alike,
that Buckingham could not tell the new ones from the old ones, and
experts in such matters would have been deceived as he was. He

Dâ€™Artagnan blushed up to the whites of his eyes. He saw that the duke
was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea
that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with
English gold was strangely repugnant to him.
NA

in the service of the King and Queen of France, and form part of the
company of Monsieur Dessessart, who, as well as his brother-in-law,
Monsieur de Treville, is particularly attached to their Majesties. What
I have done, then, has been for the queen, and not at all for your
Grace. And still further, it is very probable I should not have done
anything of this, if it had not been to make myself agreeable to someone

or the corridors of the Louvre--all which, however, will not prevent me
from executing to the very point my commission or from laying down my
life, if there be need of it, to accomplish it; but I repeat it to your
Grace, without your having personally on that account more to thank me

Dâ€™Artagnan bowed to the duke, and was retiring.

each of these relays your address in Paris, the four horses will follow
you thither. You already know two of them, and you appeared to
appreciate them like a judge. They were those we rode on; and you may
rely upon me for the others not being inferior to them. These horses are
equipped for the field. However proud you may be, you will not refuse to
accept one of them, and to request your three companions to accept the
others--that is, in order to make war against us. Besides, the end

field of battle; but in the meantime we shall part good friends, I

NA
NA

Dâ€™Artagnan bowed to the duke, and made his way as quickly as possible to
the riverside. Opposite the Tower of London he found the vessel that had
been named to him, delivered his letter to the captain, who after having
it examined by the governor of the port made immediate preparations to
sail.
Fifty vessels were waiting to set out. Passing alongside one of them,
dâ€™Artagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of Meung--the same
whom the unknown gentleman had called Milady, and whom dâ€™Artagnan had
thought so handsome; but thanks to the current of the stream and a fair
wind, his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than a
glimpse of her.
The next day about nine oâ€™clock in the morning, he landed at St. Valery.
Dâ€™Artagnan went instantly in search of the inn, and easily discovered it
by the riotous noise which resounded from it. War between England and
France was talked of as near and certain, and the jolly sailors were
having a carousal.
Dâ€™Artagnan made his way through the crowd, advanced toward the host, and

follow, went out with him by a door which opened into a yard, led him to
the stable, where a saddled horse awaited him, and asked him if he stood
in need of anything else.
NA
â€œGo from hence to Blangy, and from Blangy to Neufchatel. At Neufchatel,

NA
NA

Four hours later he was in Neufchatel. He strictly followed the
instructions he had received. At Neufchatel, as at St. Valery, he found
a horse quite ready and awaiting him. He was about to remove the pistols
from the saddle he had quit to the one he was about to fill, but he
found the holsters furnished with similar pistols.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThat of Rouen; but you will leave the city on your right. You must stop
at the little village of Eccuis, in which there is but one tavern--the
Shield of France. Donâ€™t condemn it from appearances; you will find a

NA
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan shook his head, and set off at full speed. At Eccuis, the
same scene was repeated. He found as provident a host and a fresh horse.
He left his address as he had done before, and set off again at the same
pace for Pontoise. At Pontoise he changed his horse for the last time,
and at nine oâ€™clock galloped into the yard of Trevilleâ€™s hotel. He had
made nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve hours.
M de Treville received him as if he had seen him that same morning;
only, when pressing his hand a little more warmly than usual, he
informed him that the company of Dessessart was on duty at the Louvre,
and that he might repair at once to his post.
22 THE BALLET OF LA MERLAISON
On the morrow, nothing was talked of in Paris but the ball which the
aldermen of the city were to give to the king and queen, and in which
their Majesties were to dance the famous La Merlaison--the favorite
ballet of the king.
Eight days had been occupied in preparations at the Hotel de Ville for
this important evening. The city carpenters had erected scaffolds upon
which the invited ladies were to be placed; the city grocer had
ornamented the chambers with two hundred FLAMBEAUX of white wax, a piece
of luxury unheard of at that period; and twenty violins were ordered,
and the price for them fixed at double the usual rate, upon condition,
said the report, that they should be played all night.
At ten oâ€™clock in the morning the Sieur de la Coste, ensign in the
kingâ€™s Guards, followed by two officers and several archers of that
body, came to the city registrar, named Clement, and demanded of him all
the keys of the rooms and offices of the hotel. These keys were given up
to him instantly. Each of them had ticket attached to it, by which it
might be recognized; and from that moment the Sieur de la Coste was
charged with the care of all the doors and all the avenues.
At eleven oâ€™clock came in his turn Duhallier, captain of the Guards,
bringing with him fifty archers, who were distributed immediately
through the Hotel de Ville, at the doors assigned them.
At three oâ€™clock came two companies of the Guards, one French, the other
Swiss. The company of French guards was composed of half of M.
Duhallierâ€™s men and half of M. Dessessartâ€™s men.
At six in the evening the guests began to come. As fast as they entered,
they were placed in the grand saloon, on the platforms prepared for
them.
At nine oâ€™clock Madame la Premiere Presidente arrived. As next to the
queen, she was the most considerable personage of the fete, she was
received by the city officials, and placed in a box opposite to that
which the queen was to occupy.
At ten oâ€™clock, the kingâ€™s collation, consisting of preserves and other
delicacies, was prepared in the little room on the side of the church of
St. Jean, in front of the silver buffet of the city, which was guarded
by four archers.
At midnight great cries and loud acclamations were heard. It was the
king, who was passing through the streets which led from the Louvre to
the Hotel de Ville, and which were all illuminated with colored
lanterns.
Immediately the aldermen, clothed in their cloth robes and preceded by
six sergeants, each holding a FLAMBEAU in his hand, went to attend upon
the king, whom they met on the steps, where the provost of the merchants
made him the speech of welcome--a compliment to which his Majesty
replied with an apology for coming so late, laying the blame upon the
cardinal, who had detained him till eleven oâ€™clock, talking of affairs
of state.
His Majesty, in full dress, was accompanied by his royal Highness, M. le
Comte de Soissons, by the Grand Prior, by the Duc de Longueville, by the
Duc dâ€™Euboeuf, by the Comte dâ€™Harcourt, by the Comte de la Roche-Guyon,
by M. de Liancourt, by M. de Baradas, by the Comte de Cramail, and by
the Chevalier de Souveray. Everybody noticed that the king looked dull
and preoccupied.
A private room had been prepared for the king and another for Monsieur.
In each of these closets were placed masquerade dresses. The same had
been done for the queen and Madame the President. The nobles and ladies
of their Majestiesâ€™ suites were to dress, two by two, in chambers
prepared for the purpose. Before entering his closet the king desired to
be informed the moment the cardinal arrived.
Half an hour after the entrance of the king, fresh acclamations were
heard; these announced the arrival of the queen. The aldermen did as
they had done before, and preceded by their sergeants, advanced to
receive their illustrious guest. The queen entered the great hall; and
it was remarked that, like the king, she looked dull and even weary.
At the moment she entered, the curtain of a small gallery which to that
time had been closed, was drawn, and the pale face of the cardinal
appeared, he being dressed as a Spanish cavalier. His eyes were fixed
upon those of the queen, and a smile of terrible joy passed over his
lips; the queen did not wear her diamond studs.
The queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the
city dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies. All at
once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the
hall. The cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice, and the king was
very pale.
The king made his way through the crowd without a mask, and the ribbons
of his doublet scarcely tied. He went straight to the queen, and in an
altered voice said, â€œWhy, madame, have you not thought proper to wear
your diamond studs, when you know it would give me so much

The queen cast a glance around her, and saw the cardinal behind, with a
diabolical smile on his countenance.
NA

NA
â€œAnd you were wrong, madame. If I made you that present it was that you

The voice of the king was tremulous with anger. Everybody looked and
listened with astonishment, comprehending nothing of what passed.
NA
NA
â€œDo so, madame, do so, and that at once; for within an hour the ballet
NA
The queen bent in token of submission, and followed the ladies who were
to conduct her to her room. On his part the king returned to his
apartment.
There was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly. Everybody
had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen; but
both of them had spoken so low that everybody, out of respect, withdrew
several steps, so that nobody had heard anything. The violins began to
sound with all their might, but nobody listened to them.
The king came out first from his room. He was in a most elegant hunting
costume; and Monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like him. This
was the costume that best became the king. So dressed, he really
appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom.
The cardinal drew near to the king, and placed in his hand a small
casket. The king opened it, and found in it two diamond studs.
NA
NA
I very much doubt, count them, sire, and if you only find ten, ask her
NA
The king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him; but he had not
time to address any question to him--a cry of admiration burst from
every mouth. If the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his
kingdom, the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in France.
It is true that the habit of a huntress became her admirably. She wore a
beaver hat with blue feathers, a surtout of gray-pearl velvet, fastened
with diamond clasps, and a petticoat of blue satin, embroidered with
silver. On her left shoulder sparkled the diamond studs, on a bow of the
same color as the plumes and the petticoat.
The king trembled with joy and the cardinal with vexation; although,
distant as they were from the queen, they could not count the studs. The
queen had them. The only question was, had she ten or twelve?
At that moment the violins sounded the signal for the ballet. The king
advanced toward Madame the President, with whom he was to dance, and his
Highness Monsieur with the queen. They took their places, and the ballet
began.
The king danced facing the queen, and every time he passed by her, he
devoured with his eyes those studs of which he could not ascertain the
number. A cold sweat covered the brow of the cardinal.
The ballet lasted an hour, and had sixteen ENTREES. The ballet ended
amid the applause of the whole assemblage, and everyone reconducted his
lady to her place; but the king took advantage of the privilege he had
of leaving his lady, to advance eagerly toward the queen.
NA

With these words he held out to the queen the two studs the cardinal had
given him.

NA
Then saluting the king and the cardinal, the queen resumed her way to
the chamber in which she had dressed, and where she was to take off her
costume.
The attention which we have been obliged to give, during the
commencement of the chapter, to the illustrious personages we have
introduced into it, has diverted us for an instant from him to whom Anne
of Austria owed the extraordinary triumph she had obtained over the
cardinal; and who, confounded, unknown, lost in the crowd gathered at
one of the doors, looked on at this scene, comprehensible only to four
persons--the king, the queen, his Eminence, and himself.
The queen had just regained her chamber, and dâ€™Artagnan was about to
retire, when he felt his shoulder lightly touched. He turned and saw a
young woman, who made him a sign to follow her. The face of this young
woman was covered with a black velvet mask; but notwithstanding this
precaution, which was in fact taken rather against others than against
him, he at once recognized his usual guide, the light and intelligent
Mme. Bonacieux.
On the evening before, they had scarcely seen each other for a moment at
the apartment of the Swiss guard, Germain, whither dâ€™Artagnan had sent
for her. The haste which the young woman was in to convey to the queen
the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented the
two lovers from exchanging more than a few words. Dâ€™Artagnan therefore
followed Mme. Bonacieux moved by a double sentiment--love and curiosity.
All the way, and in proportion as the corridors became more deserted,
dâ€™Artagnan wished to stop the young woman, seize her and gaze upon her,
were it only for a minute; but quick as a bird she glided between his
hands, and when he wished to speak to her, her finger placed upon her
mouth, with a little imperative gesture full of grace, reminded him that
he was under the command of a power which he must blindly obey, and
which forbade him even to make the slightest complaint. At length, after
winding about for a minute or two, Mme. Bonacieux opened the door of a
closet, which was entirely dark, and led dâ€™Artagnan into it. There she
made a fresh sign of silence, and opened a second door concealed by
tapestry. The opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light, and she
disappeared.
Dâ€™Artagnan remained for a moment motionless, asking himself where he
could be; but soon a ray of light which penetrated through the chamber,
together with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same
aperture, the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once
NA
indicated clearly that he was in a closet attached to the queenâ€™s
apartment. The young man waited in comparative darkness and listened.
The queen appeared cheerful and happy, which seemed to astonish the
persons who surrounded her and who were accustomed to see her almost
always sad and full of care. The queen attributed this joyous feeling to
the beauty of the fete, to the pleasure she had experienced in the
ballet; and as it is not permissible to contradict a queen, whether she
smile or weep, everybody expatiated on the gallantry of the aldermen of
the city of Paris.
Although dâ€™Artagnan did not at all know the queen, he soon distinguished
her voice from the others, at first by a slightly foreign accent, and
next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal
words. He heard her approach and withdraw from the partially open door;
and twice or three times he even saw the shadow of a person intercept
the light.
At length a hand and an arm, surpassingly beautiful in their form and
whiteness, glided through the tapestry. Dâ€™Artagnan at once comprehended
that this was his recompense. He cast himself on his knees, seized the
hand, and touched it respectfully with his lips. Then the hand was
withdrawn, leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a ring. The
door immediately closed, and dâ€™Artagnan found himself again in complete
obscurity.
Dâ€™Artagnan placed the ring on his finger, and again waited; it was
evident that all was not yet over. After the reward of his devotion,
that of his love was to come. Besides, although the ballet was danced,
the evening had scarcely begun. Supper was to be served at three, and
the clock of St. Jean had struck three quarters past two.
The sound of voices diminished by degrees in the adjoining chamber. The
company was then heard departing; then the door of the closet in which
dâ€™Artagnan was, was opened, and Mme. Bonacieux entered.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
At these words she opened the door of the corridor, and pushed
dâ€™Artagnan out of the room. Dâ€™Artagnan obeyed like a child, without the
least resistance or objection, which proved that he was really in love.
23 THE RENDEZVOUS
Dâ€™Artagnan ran home immediately, and although it was three oâ€™clock in
the morning and he had some of the worst quarters of Paris to traverse,
he met with no misadventure. Everyone knows that drunkards and lovers
have a protecting deity.
He found the door of his passage open, sprang up the stairs and knocked
softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey. Planchet*,
whom he had sent home two hours before from the Hotel de Ville, telling
him to sit up for him, opened the door for him.

NA
            Buckingham perhaps sent him to Paris, as he did the
            horses._

NA
NA
NA
â€œI mean to say that when I came in, although I had the key of your
apartment in my pocket, and that key had never quit me, I found a letter

NA
â€œI left it where I found it, monsieur. It is not natural for letters to
enter peopleâ€™s houses in this manner. If the window had been open or
even ajar, I should think nothing of it; but, no--all was hermetically

Meanwhile, the young man had darted in to his chamber, and opened the
letter. It was from Mme. Bonacieux, and was expressed in these terms:
â€œThere are many thanks to be offered to you, and to be transmitted to
you. Be this evening about ten oâ€™clock at St. Cloud, in front of the

While reading this letter, dâ€™Artagnan felt his heart dilated and
compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the
hearts of lovers.
It was the first billet he had received; it was the first rendezvous
that had been granted him. His heart, swelled by the intoxication of
joy, felt ready to dissolve away at the very gate of that terrestrial
paradise called Love!
NA
and pale successively, â€œdid I not guess truly? Is it not some bad

And Planchet retired, shaking his head with an air of doubt, which the
liberality of dâ€™Artagnan had not entirely effaced.
Left alone, dâ€™Artagnan read and reread his billet. Then he kissed and
rekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful
mistress. At length he went to bed, fell asleep, and had golden dreams.
At seven oâ€™clock in the morning he arose and called Planchet, who at the
second summons opened the door, his countenance not yet quite freed from
the anxiety of the preceding night.

NA
M Bonacieux was at his door. Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s intention was to go out
without speaking to the worthy mercer; but the latter made so polite and
friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged, not only to stop,
but to enter into conversation with him.
Besides, how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a
husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same
evening at St. Cloud, opposite Dâ€™Estreesâ€™s pavilion? Dâ€™Artagnan
approached him with the most amiable air he could assume.
The conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man.
M. Bonacieux, who was ignorant that dâ€™Artagnan had overheard his
conversation with the stranger of Meung, related to his young tenant the
persecutions of that monster, M. de Laffemas, whom he never ceased to
designate, during his account, by the title of the â€œcardinalâ€™s
NA
bolts, the wickets, the dungeons, the gratings, the instruments of
torture.
Dâ€™Artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance, and when he had
finished said, â€œAnd Madame Bonacieux, do you know who carried her
off?--For I do not forget that I owe to that unpleasant circumstance the
NA
NA
wife, on her part, has sworn to me by all thatâ€™s sacred that she does

that dâ€™Artagnan did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary
shade which, an instant before, had darkened the countenance of the
worthy man.

NA
NA
â€œNo; but since my arrest and the robbery that was committed in my house,

with as much impatience as I do; perhaps this evening Madame Bonacieux

happy, I wish all the world to be so; but it appears that is not

The young man departed, laughing at the joke, which he thought he alone
could comprehend.
NA
But dâ€™Artagnan was too far off to hear him; and if he had heard him in
the disposition of mind he then enjoyed, he certainly would not have
remarked it.
He took his way toward the hotel of M. de Treville; his visit of the day
before, it is to be remembered, had been very short and very little
explicative.
He found Treville in a joyful mood. He had thought the king and queen
charming at the ball. It is true the cardinal had been particularly
ill-tempered. He had retired at one oâ€™clock under the pretense of being
indisposed. As to their Majesties, they did not return to the Louvre
till six oâ€™clock in the morning.
NA
of the apartment to see if they were alone, â€œnow let us talk about
yourself, my young friend; for it is evident that your happy return has
something to do with the joy of the king, the triumph of the queen, and

â€œEverything, believe me. The cardinal is not the man to forget a
mystification until he has settled account with the mystifier; and the
mystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young Gascon

â€œDo you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself, and
NA
â€œThe devil! You have been to London! Was it from London you brought that
beautiful diamond that glitters on your finger? Beware, my dear
dâ€™Artagnan! A present from an enemy is not a good thing. Are there not

NA
the first rudiments of that language into his head, and who had by his

day. Stop a minute--ah, this is it: â€˜Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes,â€™

â€œWell, then, off to the nearest goldsmithâ€™s, and sell that diamond for

he will give you at least eight hundred pistoles. Pistoles have no name,
young man, and that ring has a terrible one, which may betray him who

â€œPARDIEU! They did not scruple much in the case of Athos. At all events,
young man, rely upon one who has been thirty years at court. Do not lull
yourself in security, or you will be lost; but, on the contrary--and it
is I who say it--see enemies in all directions. If anyone seeks a
quarrel with you, shun it, were it with a child of ten years old. If you
are attacked by day or by night, fight, but retreat, without shame; if
you cross a bridge, feel every plank of it with your foot, lest one
should give way beneath you; if you pass before a house which is being
built, look up, for fear a stone should fall upon your head; if you stay
out late, be always followed by your lackey, and let your lackey be
armed--if, by the by, you can be sure of your lackey. Mistrust
everybody, your friend, your brother, your mistress--your mistress above

Dâ€™Artagnan blushed.
NA
NA
â€œBecause a mistress is one of the cardinalâ€™s favorite means; he has not
one that is more expeditious. A woman will sell you for ten pistoles,
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan thought of the appointment Mme. Bonacieux had made with him
for that very evening; but we are bound to say, to the credit of our
hero, that the bad opinion entertained by M. de Treville of women in
general, did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty
hostess.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, I left them on my road--Porthos at Chantilly, with a duel on his
hands; Aramis at Crevecoeur, with a ball in his shoulder; and Athos at

Dâ€™Artagnan left M. de Treville, touched more than ever by his paternal
solicitude for his Musketeers.
He called successively at the abodes of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.
Neither of them had returned. Their lackeys likewise were absent, and
nothing had been heard of either the one or the other. He would have
inquired after them of their mistresses, but he was neither acquainted
with Porthosâ€™s nor Aramisâ€™s, and as to Athos, he had none.
As he passed the Hotel des Gardes, he took a glance in to the stables.
Three of the four horses had already arrived. Planchet, all
astonishment, was busy grooming them, and had already finished two.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œBecause, while you were talking with him, I watched you without
listening to you; and, monsieur, his countenance changed color two or

â€œPreoccupied as Monsieur was with the letter he had received, he did not
observe that; but I, whom the strange fashion in which that letter came

Planchet seeing there was no longer any hope of making his master
renounce his project, heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom
the third horse.
As to dâ€™Artagnan, being at bottom a prudent youth, instead of returning
home, went and dined with the Gascon priest, who, at the time of the
distress of the four friends, had given them a breakfast of chocolate.
24 THE PAVILION
At nine oâ€™clock dâ€™Artagnan was at the Hotel des Gardes; he found
Planchet all ready. The fourth horse had arrived.
Planchet was armed with his musketoon and a pistol. Dâ€™Artagnan had his
sword and placed two pistols in his belt; then both mounted and departed
quietly. It was quite dark, and no one saw them go out. Planchet took
place behind his master, and kept at a distance of ten paces from him.
Dâ€™Artagnan crossed the quays, went out by the gate of La Conference and
followed the road, much more beautiful then than it is now, which leads
to St. Cloud.
As long as he was in the city, Planchet kept at the respectful distance
he had imposed upon himself; but as soon as the road began to be more
lonely and dark, he drew softly nearer, so that when they entered the
Bois de Boulogne he found himself riding quite naturally side by side
with his master. In fact, we must not dissemble that the oscillation of
the tall trees and the reflection of the moon in the dark underwood gave
him serious uneasiness. Dâ€™Artagnan could not help perceiving that
something more than usual was passing in the mind of his lackey and
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œBut why did you not dare to speak aloud, Planchet--because you are
NA
NA
â€œAfraid of being heard! Why, there is nothing improper in our

Planchet followed the movements of his master as if he had been his
shadow, and was soon trotting by his side.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo; I only beg leave to observe to Monsieur that the night will be very
cold, that chills bring on rheumatism, and that a lackey who has the
rheumatism makes but a poor servant, particularly to a master as active
NA
â€œWell, if you are cold, Planchet, you can go into one of those cabarets
that you see yonder, and be in waiting for me at the door by six oâ€™clock
NA
â€œMonsieur, I have eaten and drunk respectfully the crown you gave me

NA
Dâ€™Artagnan sprang from his horse, threw the bridle to Planchet, and
departed at a quick pace, folding his cloak around him.
NA
of his master; and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went
straight to a house set out with all the attributes of a suburban
tavern, and knocked at the door.
In the meantime dâ€™Artagnan, who had plunged into a bypath, continued his
route and reached St. Cloud; but instead of following the main street he
turned behind the chateau, reached a sort of retired lane, and found
himself soon in front of the pavilion named. It was situated in a very
private spot. A high wall, at the angle of which was the pavilion, ran
along one side of this lane, and on the other was a little garden
connected with a poor cottage which was protected by a hedge from
passers-by.
He gained the place appointed, and as no signal had been given him by
which to announce his presence, he waited.
Not the least noise was to be heard; it might be imagined that he was a
hundred miles from the capital. Dâ€™Artagnan leaned against the hedge,
after having cast a glance behind it. Beyond that hedge, that garden,
and that cottage, a dark mist enveloped with its folds that immensity
where Paris slept--a vast void from which glittered a few luminous
points, the funeral stars of that hell!
But for dâ€™Artagnan all aspects were clothed happily, all ideas wore a
smile, all shades were diaphanous. The appointed hour was about to
strike. In fact, at the end of a few minutes the belfry of St. Cloud let
fall slowly ten strokes from its sonorous jaws. There was something
melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the
middle of the night; but each of those strokes, which made up the
expected hour, vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young man.
His eyes were fixed upon the little pavilion situated at the angle of
the wall, of which all the windows were closed with shutters, except one
on the first story. Through this window shone a mild light which
silvered the foliage of two or three linden trees which formed a group
outside the park. There could be no doubt that behind this little
window, which threw forth such friendly beams, the pretty Mme. Bonacieux
expected him.
Wrapped in this sweet idea, dâ€™Artagnan waited half an hour without the
least impatience, his eyes fixed upon that charming little abode of
which he could perceive a part of the ceiling with its gilded moldings,
attesting the elegance of the rest of the apartment.
The belfry of St. Cloud sounded half past ten.
This time, without knowing why, dâ€™Artagnan felt a cold shiver run
through his veins. Perhaps the cold began to affect him, and he took a
perfectly physical sensation for a moral impression.
Then the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly, and that the
appointment was for eleven oâ€™clock. He drew near to the window, and
placing himself so that a ray of light should fall upon the letter as he
held it, he drew it from his pocket and read it again; but he had not
been mistaken, the appointment was for ten oâ€™clock. He went and resumed
his post, beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and this
solitude.
Eleven oâ€™clock sounded.
Dâ€™Artagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to Mme.
Bonacieux. He clapped his hands three times--the ordinary signal of
lovers; but nobody replied to him, not even an echo.
He then thought, with a touch of vexation, that perhaps the young woman
had fallen asleep while waiting for him. He approached the wall, and
tried to climb it; but the wall had been recently pointed, and
dâ€™Artagnan could get no hold.
At that moment he thought of the trees, upon whose leaves the light
still shone; and as one of them drooped over the road, he thought that
from its branches he might get a glimpse of the interior of the
pavilion.
The tree was easy to climb. Besides, dâ€™Artagnan was but twenty years
old, and consequently had not yet forgotten his schoolboy habits. In an
instant he was among the branches, and his keen eyes plunged through the
transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion.
It was a strange thing, and one which made dâ€™Artagnan tremble from the
sole of his foot to the roots of his hair, to find that this soft light,
this calm lamp, enlightened a scene of fearful disorder. One of the
windows was broken, the door of the chamber had been beaten in and hung,
split in two, on its hinges. A table, which had been covered with an
elegant supper, was overturned. The decanters broken in pieces, and the
fruits crushed, strewed the floor. Everything in the apartment gave
evidence of a violent and desperate struggle. Dâ€™Artagnan even fancied he
could recognize amid this strange disorder, fragments of garments, and
some bloody spots staining the cloth and the curtains. He hastened to
descend into the street, with a frightful beating at his heart; he
wished to see if he could find other traces of violence.
The little soft light shone on in the calmness of the night. Dâ€™Artagnan
then perceived a thing that he had not before remarked--for nothing had
led him to the examination--that the ground, trampled here and
hoofmarked there, presented confused traces of men and horses. Besides,
the wheels of a carriage, which appeared to have come from Paris, had
made a deep impression in the soft earth, which did not extend beyond
the pavilion, but turned again toward Paris.
At length dâ€™Artagnan, in pursuing his researches, found near the wall a
womanâ€™s torn glove. This glove, wherever it had not touched the muddy
ground, was of irreproachable odor. It was one of those perfumed gloves
that lovers like to snatch from a pretty hand.
As dâ€™Artagnan pursued his investigations, a more abundant and more icy
sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead; his heart was oppressed
by a horrible anguish; his respiration was broken and short. And yet he
said, to reassure himself, that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in
common with Mme. Bonacieux; that the young woman had made an appointment
with him before the pavilion, and not in the pavilion; that she might
have been detained in Paris by her duties, or perhaps by the jealousy of
her husband.
But all these reasons were combated, destroyed, overthrown, by that
feeling of intimate pain which, on certain occasions, takes possession
of our being, and cries to us so as to be understood unmistakably that
some great misfortune is hanging over us.
Then dâ€™Artagnan became almost wild. He ran along the high road, took the
path he had before taken, and reaching the ferry, interrogated the
boatman.
About seven oâ€™clock in the evening, the boatman had taken over a young
woman, wrapped in a black mantle, who appeared to be very anxious not to
be recognized; but entirely on account of her precautions, the boatman
had paid more attention to her and discovered that she was young and
pretty.
There were then, as now, a crowd of young and pretty women who came to
St. Cloud, and who had reasons for not being seen, and yet dâ€™Artagnan
did not for an instant doubt that it was Mme. Bonacieux whom the boatman
had noticed.
Dâ€™Artagnan took advantage of the lamp which burned in the cabin of the
ferryman to read the billet of Mme. Bonacieux once again, and satisfy
himself that he had not been mistaken, that the appointment was at St.
Cloud and not elsewhere, before the Dâ€™Estreesâ€™s pavilion and not in
another street. Everything conspired to prove to dâ€™Artagnan that his
presentiments had not deceived him, and that a great misfortune had
happened.
He again ran back to the chateau. It appeared to him that something
might have happened at the pavilion in his absence, and that fresh
information awaited him. The lane was still deserted, and the same calm
soft light shone through the window.
Dâ€™Artagnan then thought of that cottage, silent and obscure, which had
no doubt seen all, and could tell its tale. The gate of the enclosure
was shut; but he leaped over the hedge, and in spite of the barking of a
chained-up dog, went up to the cabin.
No one answered to his first knocking. A silence of death reigned in the
cabin as in the pavilion; but as the cabin was his last resource, he
knocked again.
It soon appeared to him that he heard a slight noise within--a timid
noise which seemed to tremble lest it should be heard.
Then dâ€™Artagnan ceased knocking, and prayed with an accent so full of
anxiety and promises, terror and cajolery, that his voice was of a
nature to reassure the most fearful. At length an old, worm-eaten
shutter was opened, or rather pushed ajar, but closed again as soon as
the light from a miserable lamp which burned in the corner had shone
upon the baldric, sword belt, and pistol pommels of dâ€™Artagnan.
Nevertheless, rapid as the movement had been, dâ€™Artagnan had had time to
get a glimpse of the head of an old man.
NA
for someone who has not come. I am dying with anxiety. Has anything
NA
The window was again opened slowly, and the same face appeared, only it
was now still more pale than before.
Dâ€™Artagnan related his story simply, with the omission of names. He told
how he had a rendezvous with a young woman before that pavilion, and
how, not seeing her come, he had climbed the linden tree, and by the
light of the lamp had seen the disorder of the chamber.
The old man listened attentively, making a sign only that it was all so;
and then, when dâ€™Artagnan had ended, he shook his head with an air that
announced nothing good.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA

The old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the
young man that he made him a sign to listen, and repeated in a low
voice: â€œIt was scarcely nine oâ€™clock when I heard a noise in the street,
and was wondering what it could be, when on coming to my door, I found
that somebody was endeavoring to open it. As I am very poor and am not
afraid of being robbed, I went and opened the gate and saw three men at
a few paces from it. In the shadow was a carriage with two horses, and
some saddlehorses. These horses evidently belonged to the three men, who
were dressed as cavaliers. â€˜Ah, my worthy gentlemen,â€™ cried I, â€˜what do
you want?â€™ â€˜You must have a ladder?â€™ said he who appeared to be the
leader of the party. â€˜Yes, monsieur, the one with which I gather my
fruit.â€™ â€˜Lend it to us, and go into your house again; there is a crown
for the annoyance we have caused you. Only remember this--if you speak a
word of what you may see or what you may hear (for you will look and you
will listen, I am quite sure, however we may threaten you), you are
lost.â€™ At these words he threw me a crown, which I picked up, and he
took the ladder. After shutting the gate behind them, I pretended to
return to the house, but I immediately went out a back door, and
stealing along in the shade of the hedge, I gained yonder clump of
elder, from which I could hear and see everything. The three men brought
the carriage up quietly, and took out of it a little man, stout, short,
elderly, and commonly dressed in clothes of a dark color, who ascended
the ladder very carefully, looked suspiciously in at the window of the
pavilion, came down as quietly as he had gone up, and whispered, â€˜It is
she!â€™ Immediately, he who had spoken to me approached the door of the
pavilion, opened it with a key he had in his hand, closed the door and
disappeared, while at the same time the other two men ascended the
ladder. The little old man remained at the coach door; the coachman took
care of his horses, the lackey held the saddlehorses. All at once great
cries resounded in the pavilion, and a woman came to the window, and
opened it, as if to throw herself out of it; but as soon as she
perceived the other two men, she fell back and they went into the
chamber. Then I saw no more; but I heard the noise of breaking
furniture. The woman screamed, and cried for help; but her cries were
soon stifled. Two of the men appeared, bearing the woman in their arms,
and carried her to the carriage, into which the little old man got after
her. The leader closed the window, came out an instant after by the
door, and satisfied himself that the woman was in the carriage. His two
companions were already on horseback. He sprang into his saddle; the
lackey took his place by the coachman; the carriage went off at a quick
pace, escorted by the three horsemen, and all was over. From that moment
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan, entirely overcome by this terrible story, remained
motionless and mute, while all the demons of anger and jealousy were
howling in his heart.

despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would
have done, â€œdo not take on so; they did not kill her, and thatâ€™s a

With a heavy heart, dâ€™Artagnan again bent his way toward the ferry.
Sometimes he hoped it could not be Mme. Bonacieux, and that he should
find her next day at the Louvre; sometimes he feared she had had an
intrigue with another, who, in a jealous fit, had surprised her and
carried her off. His mind was torn by doubt, grief, and despair.
NA
least, some hopes of finding her; but who knows what has become of
NA
It was past midnight; the next thing was to find Planchet. Dâ€™Artagnan
went successively into all the cabarets in which there was a light, but
could not find Planchet in any of them.
At the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather dubious.
Dâ€™Artagnan had appointed six oâ€™clock in the morning for his lackey, and
wherever he might be, he was right.
Besides, it came into the young manâ€™s mind that by remaining in the
environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed, he would,
perhaps, have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair. At the sixth
cabaret, then, as we said, dâ€™Artagnan stopped, asked for a bottle of
wine of the best quality, and placing himself in the darkest corner of
the room, determined thus to wait till daylight; but this time again his
hopes were disappointed, and although he listened with all his ears, he
heard nothing, amid the oaths, coarse jokes, and abuse which passed
between the laborers, servants, and carters who comprised the honorable
society of which he formed a part, which could put him upon the least
track of her who had been stolen from him. He was compelled, then, after
having swallowed the contents of his bottle, to pass the time as well as
to evade suspicion, to fall into the easiest position in his corner and
to sleep, whether well or ill. Dâ€™Artagnan, be it remembered, was only
twenty years old, and at that age sleep has its imprescriptible rights
which it imperiously insists upon, even with the saddest hearts.
Toward six oâ€™clock dâ€™Artagnan awoke with that uncomfortable feeling
which generally accompanies the break of day after a bad night. He was
not long in making his toilet. He examined himself to see if advantage
had been taken of his sleep, and having found his diamond ring on his
finger, his purse in his pocket, and his pistols in his belt, he rose,
paid for his bottle, and went out to try if he could have any better
luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before.
The first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest
Planchet, who, with the two horses in hand, awaited him at the door of a
little blind cabaret, before which dâ€™Artagnan had passed without even a
suspicion of its existence.
25 PORTHOS
Instead of returning directly home, dâ€™Artagnan alighted at the door of
M. de Treville, and ran quickly up the stairs. This time he had decided
to relate all that had passed. M. de Treville would doubtless give him
good advice as to the whole affair. Besides, as M. de Treville saw the
queen almost daily, he might be able to draw from her Majesty some
intelligence of the poor young woman, whom they were doubtless making
pay very dearly for her devotedness to her mistress.
M de Treville listened to the young manâ€™s account with a seriousness
which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love
affair. When dâ€™Artagnan had finished, he said, â€œHum! All this savors of
NA
NA
â€œNothing, absolutely nothing, at present, but quitting Paris, as I told
you, as soon as possible. I will see the queen; I will relate to her the
details of the disappearance of this poor woman, of which she is no
doubt ignorant. These details will guide her on her part, and on your
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan knew that, although a Gascon, M. de Treville was not in the
habit of making promises, and that when by chance he did promise, he
more than kept his word. He bowed to him, then, full of gratitude for
the past and for the future; and the worthy captain, who on his side
felt a lively interest in this young man, so brave and so resolute,
pressed his hand kindly, wishing him a pleasant journey.
Determined to put the advice of M. de Treville in practice instantly,
dâ€™Artagnan directed his course toward the Rue des Fossoyeurs, in order
to superintend the packing of his valise. On approaching the house, he
perceived M. Bonacieux in morning costume, standing at his threshold.
All that the prudent Planchet had said to him the preceding evening
about the sinister character of the old man recurred to the mind of
dâ€™Artagnan, who looked at him with more attention than he had done
before. In fact, in addition to that yellow, sickly paleness which
indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood, and which might,
besides, be accidental, dâ€™Artagnan remarked something perfidiously
significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance. A
rogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does; a
hypocrite does not shed the tears of a man of good faith. All falsehood
is a mask; and however well made the mask may be, with a little
attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true face.
It appeared, then, to dâ€™Artagnan that M. Bonacieux wore a mask, and
likewise that that mask was most disagreeable to look upon. In
consequence of this feeling of repugnance, he was about to pass without
speaking to him, but, as he had done the day before, M. Bonacieux
accosted him.
NA
oâ€™clock in the morning! PESTE! You seem to reverse ordinary customs, and
NA
NA
said the young man; â€œyou are a model for regular people. It is true that
when a man possesses a young and pretty wife, he has no need to seek
happiness elsewhere. Happiness comes to meet him, does it not, Monsieur
NA
Bonacieux became as pale as death, and grinned a ghastly smile.
NA
devil were you gladding last night, my young master? It does not appear
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan glanced down at his boots, all covered with mud; but that
same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer, and it
might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud heap. Both
were stained with splashes of mud of the same appearance.
Then a sudden idea crossed the mind of dâ€™Artagnan. That little stout
man, short and elderly, that sort of lackey, dressed in dark clothes,
treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the
escort, was Bonacieux himself. The husband had presided at the abduction
of his wife.
A terrible inclination seized dâ€™Artagnan to grasp the mercer by the
throat and strangle him; but, as we have said, he was a very prudent
youth, and he restrained himself. However, the revolution which appeared
upon his countenance was so visible that Bonacieux was terrified at it,
and he endeavored to draw back a step or two; but as he was standing
before the half of the door which was shut, the obstacle compelled him
to keep his place.
NA
me that if my boots need a sponge, your stockings and shoes stand in
equal need of a brush. May you not have been philandering a little also,
Monsieur Bonacieux? Oh, the devil! Thatâ€™s unpardonable in a man of your

one; and the roads were so bad that I brought back all this mud, which I

The place named by Bonacieux as that which had been the object of his
journey was a fresh proof in support of the suspicions dâ€™Artagnan had
conceived. Bonacieux had named Mande because Mande was in an exactly
opposite direction from St. Cloud. This probability afforded him his
first consolation. If Bonacieux knew where his wife was, one might, by
extreme means, force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret
escape. The question, then, was how to change this probability into a
certainty.
NA
said dâ€™Artagnan, â€œbut nothing makes one so thirsty as want of sleep. I
am parched with thirst. Allow me to take a glass of water in your
NA
Without waiting for the permission of his host, dâ€™Artagnan went quickly
into the house, and cast a rapid glance at the bed. It had not been
used. Bonacieux had not been abed. He had only been back an hour or two;
he had accompanied his wife to the place of her confinement, or else at
least to the first relay.
NA
is all I wanted of you. I will now go up into my apartment. I will make
Planchet brush my boots; and when he has done, I will, if you like, send

He left the mercer quite astonished at his singular farewell, and asking
himself if he had not been a little inconsiderate.
At the top of the stairs he found Planchet in a great fright.
NA
NA
NA
â€œOh! I give you a hundred, I give you a thousand times to guess,

smiling.
â€œOh, I saw the snare, and I answered you would be quite in despair on
your return.
â€œâ€˜Where has he gone?â€™ asked Monsieur de Cavois.
â€œâ€˜To Troyes, in Champagne,â€™ I answered.
â€œâ€˜And when did he set out?â€™
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou will understand, monsieur, I thought there would be still time, if
you wish, to see Monsieur de Cavois to contradict me by saying you were
not yet gone. The falsehood would then lie at my door, and as I am not a

â€œThatâ€™s the advice I was about to give Monsieur; and where are we going,
NA

Besides, are you not as anxious to learn news of Grimaud, Mousqueton,
and Bazin as I am to know what has become of Athos, Porthos, and

NA
Indeed, I think provincial air will suit us much better just now than
NA
â€œSo then, pack up our luggage, Planchet, and let us be off. On my part,
I will go out with my hands in my pockets, that nothing may be
suspected. You may join me at the Hotel des Gardes. By the way,
Planchet, I think you are right with respect to our host, and that he is
NA
â€œAh, monsieur, you may take my word when I tell you anything. I am a

Dâ€™Artagnan went out first, as had been agreed upon. Then, in order that
he might have nothing to reproach himself with, he directed his steps,
for the last time, toward the residences of his three friends. No news
had been received of them; only a letter, all perfumed and of an elegant
writing in small characters, had come for Aramis. Dâ€™Artagnan took charge
of it. Ten minutes afterward Planchet joined him at the stables of the
Hotel des Gardes. Dâ€™Artagnan, in order that there might be no time lost,
had saddled his horse himself.
NA
NA
â€œDo you think, then, monsieur, that we shall travel faster with two
NA
NA
may bring back our three friends, if we should have the good fortune to

NA
NA
NA
As they went from the Hotel des Gardes, they separated, leaving the
street at opposite ends, one having to quit Paris by the Barriere de la
Villette and the other by the Barriere Montmartre, to meet again beyond
St. Denis--a strategic maneuver which, having been executed with equal
punctuality, was crowned with the most fortunate results. Dâ€™Artagnan and
Planchet entered Pierrefitte together.
Planchet was more courageous, it must be admitted, by day than by night.
His natural prudence, however, never forsook him for a single instant.
He had forgotten not one of the incidents of the first journey, and he
looked upon everybody he met on the road as an enemy. It followed that
his hat was forever in his hand, which procured him some severe
reprimands from dâ€™Artagnan, who feared that his excess of politeness
would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no consequence.
Nevertheless, whether the passengers were really touched by the urbanity
of Planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young manâ€™s
road, our two travelers arrived at Chantilly without any accident, and
alighted at the tavern of Great St. Martin, the same at which they had
stopped on their first journey.
The host, on seeing a young man followed by a lackey with two extra
horses, advanced respectfully to the door. Now, as they had already
traveled eleven leagues, dâ€™Artagnan thought it time to stop, whether
Porthos were or were not in the inn. Perhaps it would not be prudent to
ask at once what had become of the Musketeer. The result of these
reflections was that dâ€™Artagnan, without asking information of any kind,
alighted, commended the horses to the care of his lackey, entered a
small room destined to receive those who wished to be alone, and desired
the host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a breakfast
as possible--a desire which further corroborated the high opinion the
innkeeper had formed of the traveler at first sight.
Dâ€™Artagnan was therefore served with miraculous celerity. The regiment
of the Guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom;
and dâ€™Artagnan, followed by a lackey, and traveling with four
magnificent horses, despite the simplicity of his uniform, could not
fail to make a sensation. The host desired himself to serve him; which
dâ€™Artagnan perceiving, ordered two glasses to be brought, and commenced
the following conversation.
NA
asked for a bottle of your best wine, and if you have deceived me, you
will be punished in what you have sinned; for seeing that I hate
drinking by myself, you shall drink with me. Take your glass, then, and
let us drink. But what shall we drink to, so as to avoid wounding any
NA
NA
NA
NA
toast than perhaps you may think--for it is only in prosperous
establishments that one is well received. In hotels that do not
flourish, everything is in confusion, and the traveler is a victim to
the embarrassments of his host. Now, I travel a great deal, particularly
NA
NA
NA
â€œBah, I have passed perhaps ten times through Chantilly, and out of the
ten times I have stopped three or four times at your house at least. Why
I was here only ten or twelve days ago. I was conducting some friends,
Musketeers, one of whom, by the by, had a dispute with a stranger--a man

NA
NA
â€œYes, that is my companionâ€™s name. My God, my dear host, tell me if

â€œAh, monsieur, you infuse genuine balm into my blood. We have made
considerable advances; and this very morning the surgeon declared that
if Monsieur Porthos did not pay him, he should look to me, as it was I

NA
NA
â€œWhat! You cannot tell me? Surely you ought to be able to tell me better
NA
â€œYes; but in our situation we must not say all we know--particularly as
NA
NA
â€œCertainly, monsieur. Take the stairs on your right; go up the first
NA
NA

â€œMonsieur Porthos may imagine you belong to the house, and in a fit of

NA
NA
â€œThe devil! Ah, I can understand that. It is a demand that Porthos takes

â€œWe thought so, too, monsieur. As our house is carried on very
regularly, and we make out our bills every week, at the end of eight
days we presented our account; but it appeared we had chosen an unlucky
moment, for at the first word on the subject, he sent us to all the
NA
NA
â€œLord, who can say, monsieur? With some gentleman who was traveling this
NA
NA
â€œEven to his horse, monsieur; for when the gentleman was about to set
out, we perceived that his lackey was saddling Monsieur Porthosâ€™s horse,
as well as his masterâ€™s. When we observed this to him, he told us all to
trouble ourselves about our own business, as this horse belonged to him.
We also informed Monsieur Porthos of what was going on; but he told us
we were scoundrels to doubt a gentlemanâ€™s word, and that as he had said
NA
NA
NA
not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to payment, I
hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the favor of his
custom to my brother host of the Golden Eagle; but Monsieur Porthos
replied that, my house being the best, he should remain where he was.
This reply was too flattering to allow me to insist on his departure. I
confined myself then to begging him to give up his chamber, which is the
handsomest in the hotel, and to be satisfied with a pretty little room
on the third floor; but to this Monsieur Porthos replied that as he
every moment expected his mistress, who was one of the greatest ladies
in the court, I might easily comprehend that the chamber he did me the
honor to occupy in my house was itself very mean for the visit of such a
personage. Nevertheless, while acknowledging the truth of what he said,
I thought proper to insist; but without even giving himself the trouble
to enter into any discussion with me, he took one of his pistols, laid
it on his table, day and night, and said that at the first word that
should be spoken to him about removing, either within the house or out
of it, he would blow out the brains of the person who should be so
imprudent as to meddle with a matter which only concerned himself. Since
NA
NA
â€œOh, yes, monsieur. Five days after your departure, he came back, and in
a very bad condition, too. It appears that he had met with
disagreeableness, likewise, on his journey. Unfortunately, he is more
nimble than his master; so that for the sake of his master, he puts us
all under his feet, and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for,
NA
NA
NA
â€œThat is possible, monsieur; but suppose I should happen to be brought
in contact, even four times a year, with such intelligence and

NA
NA
â€œThe favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced

â€œWell, monsieur, you understand that uneasiness makes us do many

â€œMonsieur Porthos gave us a note for his duchess, ordering us to put it
in the post. This was before his servant came. As he could not leave his

NA
â€œInstead of putting the letter in the post, which is never safe, I took
advantage of the journey of one of my lads to Paris, and ordered him to
convey the letter to this duchess himself. This was fulfilling the
intentions of Monsieur Porthos, who had desired us to be so careful of
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œDo you know who this pretended duchess is?
NA
â€œWhy, she is the old wife of a procurator* of the Chatelet, monsieur,
named Madame Coquenard, who, although she is at least fifty, still gives
herself jealous airs. It struck me as very odd that a princess should

    _*Attorney_
NA
â€œBecause she flew into a great passion on receiving the letter, saying
that Monsieur Porthos was a weathercock, and that she was sure it was
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œZounds, monsieur! Because he had boasted that he would perforate the
stranger with whom you left him in dispute; whereas the stranger, on the
contrary, in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him on his
back. As Monsieur Porthos is a very boastful man, he insists that nobody
shall know he has received this wound except the duchess, whom he
NA
NA
â€œAh, and a master stroke, too, I assure you. Your friendâ€™s soul must

NA
â€œMonsieur, I followed them from curiosity, so that I saw the combat
NA
NA
â€œOh! The affair was not long, I assure you. They placed themselves on
guard; the stranger made a feint and a lunge, and that so rapidly that
when Monsieur Porthos came to the PARADE, he had already three inches of
steel in his breast. He immediately fell backward. The stranger placed
the point of his sword at his throat; and Monsieur Porthos, finding
himself at the mercy of his adversary, acknowledged himself conquered.
Upon which the stranger asked his name, and learning that it was
Porthos, and not dâ€™Artagnan, he assisted him to rise, brought him back
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œVery well; I know all that I wish to know. Porthosâ€™s chamber is, you
NA
â€œYes, monsieur, the handsomest in the inn--a chamber that I could have
NA
NA
NA
â€œOh, monsieur, procuratorâ€™s wife or duchess, if she will but loosen her
pursestrings, it will be all the same; but she positively answered that
she was tired of the exigencies and infidelities of Monsieur Porthos,
NA
NA
â€œWe took good care not to do that; he would have found in what fashion
NA
NA
â€œOh, Lord, yes, monsieur! Yesterday he wrote again; but it was his

NA
â€œFifty at least, monsieur, and not at all handsome, according to

â€œIn that case, you may be quite at ease; she will soon be softened.
NA
â€œHow, not much! Twenty good pistoles, already, without reckoning the

â€œNever mind; if his mistress abandons him, he will find friends, I will
answer for it. So, my dear host, be not uneasy, and continue to take all

â€œMonsieur has promised me not to open his mouth about the procuratorâ€™s

NA
NA
NA
Saying these words, dâ€™Artagnan went upstairs, leaving his host a little
better satisfied with respect to two things in which he appeared to be
very much interested--his debt and his life.
At the top of the stairs, upon the most conspicuous door of the
NA
knocked, and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside, he
entered the chamber.
Porthos was in bed, and was playing a game at LANSQUENET with
Mousqueton, to keep his hand in; while a spit loaded with partridges was
turning before the fire, and on each side of a large chimneypiece, over
two chafing dishes, were boiling two stewpans, from which exhaled a
double odor of rabbit and fish stews, rejoicing to the smell. In
addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble
of a commode were covered with empty bottles.
At the sight of his friend, Porthos uttered a loud cry of joy; and
Mousqueton, rising respectfully, yielded his place to him, and went to
give an eye to the two stewpans, of which he appeared to have the
particular inspection.
NA
NA
dâ€™Artagnan with a certain degree of uneasiness, â€œyou know what has

NA
NA
NA
Porthos seemed to breathe more freely.
NA
â€œWhy, on making a thrust at my adversary, whom I had already hit three
times, and whom I meant to finish with the fourth, I put my foot on a
NA
NA
â€œHonor! Luckily for the rascal, for I should have left him dead on the

NA
â€œOh, I donâ€™t know; he had enough, and set off without waiting for the

NA
NA
NA
â€œWhy did you not have yourself conveyed to Paris? You must be cruelly
NA
â€œThat was my intention; but, my dear friend, I have one thing to confess
NA
NA
â€œIt is that as I was cruelly bored, as you say, and as I had the
seventy-five pistoles in my pocket which you had distributed to me, in
order to amuse myself I invited a gentleman who was traveling this way
to walk up, and proposed a cast of dice. He accepted my challenge, and,
my faith, my seventy-five pistoles passed from my pocket to his, without
reckoning my horse, which he won into the bargain. But you, my dear
NA
â€œWhat can you expect, my dear Porthos; a man is not privileged in all
NA
love.â€™ You are too fortunate in your love for play not to take its
revenge. What consequence can the reverses of fortune be to you? Have
you not, happy rogue that you are--have you not your duchess, who cannot

NA
Porthos, with the most careless air in the world. â€œI wrote to her to
send me fifty louis or so, of which I stood absolutely in need on

NA
NA
NA
â€œNo; so I yesterday addressed another epistle to her, still more
pressing than the first. But you are here, my dear fellow, let us speak

â€œBut your host behaves very well toward you, as it appears, my dear

full stewpans and the empty bottles.
NA
jackanapes gave me his bill, and I was forced to turn both him and his
bill out of the door; so that I am here something in the fashion of a
conqueror, holding my position, as it were, my conquest. So you see,
being in constant fear of being forced from that position, I am armed to

Mousqueton, you see that we have a reinforcement, and we must have an

NA
NA
â€œYou must give your recipe to Planchet. I may be besieged in my turn,
and I shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same
NA
NA
modest air. â€œOne only needs to be sharp, thatâ€™s all. I was brought up in
the country, and my father in his leisure time was something of a
NA
NA
â€œMonsieur, he carried on a trade which I have always thought
NA
NA
â€œAs it was a time of war between the Catholics and the Huguenots, and as
he saw the Catholics exterminate the Huguenots and the Huguenots
exterminate the Catholics--all in the name of religion--he adopted a
mixed belief which permitted him to be sometimes Catholic, sometimes a
Huguenot. Now, he was accustomed to walk with his fowling piece on his
shoulder, behind the hedges which border the roads, and when he saw a
Catholic coming alone, the Protestant religion immediately prevailed in
his mind. He lowered his gun in the direction of the traveler; then,
when he was within ten paces of him, he commenced a conversation which
almost always ended by the travelerâ€™s abandoning his purse to save his
life. It goes without saying that when he saw a Huguenot coming, he felt
himself filled with such ardent Catholic zeal that he could not
understand how, a quarter of an hour before, he had been able to have
any doubts upon the superiority of our holy religion. For my part,
monsieur, I am Catholic--my father, faithful to his principles, having
NA
NA
â€œOh, of the most unfortunate kind, monsieur. One day he was surprised in
a lonely road between a Huguenot and a Catholic, with both of whom he
had before had business, and who both knew him again; so they united
against him and hanged him on a tree. Then they came and boasted of
their fine exploit in the cabaret of the next village, where my brother
NA
NA
NA
leaving the cabaret they took different directions, my brother went and
hid himself on the road of the Catholic, and I on that of the Huguenot.
Two hours after, all was over; we had done the business of both,
admiring the foresight of our poor father, who had taken the precaution
NA
â€œWell, I must allow, as you say, your father was a very intelligent
fellow. And you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a
NA
â€œYes, monsieur, and it was he who taught me to lay a snare and ground a
line. The consequence is that when I saw our laborers, which did not at
all suit two such delicate stomachs as ours, I had recourse to a little
of my old trade. While walking near the wood of Monsieur le Prince, I
laid a few snare in the runs; and while reclining on the banks of his
Highnessâ€™s pieces of water, I slipped a few lines into his fish ponds.
So that now, thanks be to God, we do not want, as Monsieur can testify,
for partridges, rabbits, carp or eels--all light, wholesome food,
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œHe furnishes it, it is true, but he does not know that he has that
NA
â€œExplain yourself, Mousqueton; your conversation is full of instructive
NA
â€œThat is it, monsieur. It has so chanced that I met with a Spaniard in
my peregrinations who had seen many countries, and among them the New
NA
â€œWhat connection can the New World have with the bottles which are on
NA
NA
â€œThis Spaniard had in his service a lackey who had accompanied him in
his voyage to Mexico. This lackey was my compatriot; and we became the
more intimate from there being many resemblances of character between
us. We loved sporting of all kinds better than anything; so that he
related to me how in the plains of the Pampas the natives hunt the tiger
and the wild bull with simple running nooses which they throw to a
distance of twenty or thirty paces the end of a cord with such nicety;
but in face of the proof I was obliged to acknowledge the truth of the
recital. My friend placed a bottle at the distance of thirty paces, and
at each cast he caught the neck of the bottle in his running noose. I
practiced this exercise, and as nature has endowed me with some
faculties, at this day I can throw the lasso with any man in the world.
Well, do you understand, monsieur? Our host has a well-furnished cellar
the key of which never leaves him; only this cellar has a ventilating
hole. Now through this ventilating hole I throw my lasso, and as I now
know in which part of the cellar is the best wine, thatâ€™s my point for
sport. You see, monsieur, what the New World has to do with the bottles
which are on the commode and the wardrobe. Now, will you taste our wine,
NA
â€œThank you, my friend, thank you; unfortunately, I have just
NA

breakfast, dâ€™Artagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during

While Porthos and Mousqueton were breakfasting, with the appetites of
convalescents and with that brotherly cordiality which unites men in
misfortune, dâ€™Artagnan related how Aramis, being wounded, was obliged to
stop at Crevecoeur, how he had left Athos fighting at Amiens with four
men who accused him of being a coiner, and how he, dâ€™Artagnan, had been
forced to run the Comtes de Wardes through the body in order to reach
England.
But there the confidence of dâ€™Artagnan stopped. He only added that on
his return from Great Britain he had brought back four magnificent
horses--one for himself, and one for each of his companions; then he
informed Porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in
the stable of the tavern.
At this moment Planchet entered, to inform his master that the horses
were sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at
Clermont.
As dâ€™Artagnan was tolerably reassured with regard to Porthos, and as he
was anxious to obtain news of his two other friends, he held out his
hand to the wounded man, and told him he was about to resume his route
in order to continue his researches. For the rest, as he reckoned upon
returning by the same route in seven or eight days, if Porthos were
still at the Great St. Martin, he would call for him on his way.
Porthos replied that in all probability his sprain would not permit him
to depart yet awhile. Besides, it was necessary he should stay at
Chantilly to wait for the answer from his duchess.
Dâ€™Artagnan wished that answer might be prompt and favorable; and having
again recommended Porthos to the care of Mousqueton, and paid his bill
to the host, he resumed his route with Planchet, already relieved of one
of his led horses.
26 ARAMIS AND HIS THESIS
Dâ€™Artagnan had said nothing to Porthos of his wound or of his
procuratorâ€™s wife. Our Bearnais was a prudent lad, however young he
might be. Consequently he had appeared to believe all that the
vainglorious Musketeer had told him, convinced that no friendship will
hold out against a surprised secret. Besides, we feel always a sort of
mental superiority over those whose lives we know better than they
suppose. In his projects of intrigue for the future, and determined as
he was to make his three friends the instruments of his fortune,
dâ€™Artagnan was not sorry at getting into his grasp beforehand the
invisible strings by which he reckoned upon moving them.
And yet, as he journeyed along, a profound sadness weighed upon his
heart. He thought of that young and pretty Mme. Bonacieux who was to
have paid him the price of his devotedness; but let us hasten to say
that this sadness possessed the young man less from the regret of the
happiness he had missed, than from the fear he entertained that some
serious misfortune had befallen the poor woman. For himself, he had no
doubt she was a victim of the cardinalâ€™s vengeance; and, as was well
known, the vengeance of his Eminence was terrible. How he had found
grace in the eyes of the minister, he did not know; but without doubt M.
de Cavois would have revealed this to him if the captain of the Guards
had found him at home.
Nothing makes time pass more quickly or more shortens a journey than a
thought which absorbs in itself all the faculties of the organization of
him who thinks. External existence then resembles a sleep of which this
thought is the dream. By its influence, time has no longer measure,
space has no longer distance. We depart from one place, and arrive at
another, that is all. Of the interval passed, nothing remains in the
memory but a vague mist in which a thousand confused images of trees,
mountains, and landscapes are lost. It was as a prey to this
hallucination that dâ€™Artagnan traveled, at whatever pace his horse
pleased, the six or eight leagues that separated Chantilly from
Crevecoeur, without his being able to remember on his arrival in the
village any of the things he had passed or met with on the road.
There only his memory returned to him. He shook his head, perceived the
cabaret at which he had left Aramis, and putting his horse to the trot,
he shortly pulled up at the door.
This time it was not a host but a hostess who received him. Dâ€™Artagnan
was a physiognomist. His eye took in at a glance the plump, cheerful
countenance of the mistress of the place, and he at once perceived there
was no occasion for dissembling with her, or of fearing anything from
one blessed with such a joyous physiognomy.

Dâ€™Artagnan walked quickly in the direction indicated, and found one of
those exterior staircases that are still to be seen in the yards of our
old-fashioned taverns. But there was no getting at the place of sojourn
of the future abbe; the defiles of the chamber of Aramis were as well
guarded as the gardens of Armida. Bazin was stationed in the corridor,
and barred his passage with the more intrepidity that, after many years
of trial, Bazin found himself near a result of which he had ever been
ambitious.
In fact, the dream of poor Bazin had always been to serve a churchman;
and he awaited with impatience the moment, always in the future, when
Aramis would throw aside the uniform and assume the cassock. The
daily-renewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long be
delayed, had alone kept him in the service of a Musketeer--a service in
which, he said, his soul was in constant jeopardy.
Bazin was then at the height of joy. In all probability, this time his
master would not retract. The union of physical pain with moral
uneasiness had produced the effect so long desired. Aramis, suffering at
once in body and mind, had at length fixed his eyes and his thoughts
upon religion, and he had considered as a warning from heaven the double
accident which had happened to him; that is to say, the sudden
disappearance of his mistress and the wound in his shoulder.
It may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his
master nothing could be more disagreeable to Bazin than the arrival of
dâ€™Artagnan, which might cast his master back again into that vortex of
mundane affairs which had so long carried him away. He resolved, then,
to defend the door bravely; and as, betrayed by the mistress of the inn,
he could not say that Aramis was absent, he endeavored to prove to the
newcomer that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his
master in his pious conference, which had commenced with the morning and
would not, as Bazin said, terminate before night.
But dâ€™Artagnan took very little heed of the eloquent discourse of M.
Bazin; and as he had no desire to support a polemic discussion with his
friendâ€™s valet, he simply moved him out of the way with one hand, and
with the other turned the handle of the door of Number Five. The door
opened, and dâ€™Artagnan went into the chamber.
Aramis, in a black gown, his head enveloped in a sort of round flat cap,
not much unlike a CALOTTE, was seated before an oblong table, covered
with rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio. At his right hand was
placed the superior of the Jesuits, and on his left the curate of
Montdidier. The curtains were half drawn, and only admitted the
mysterious light calculated for beatific reveries. All the mundane
objects that generally strike the eye on entering the room of a young
man, particularly when that young man is a Musketeer, had disappeared as
if by enchantment; and for fear, no doubt, that the sight of them might
bring his master back to ideas of this world, Bazin had laid his hands
upon sword, pistols, plumed hat, and embroideries and laces of all kinds
and sorts. In their stead dâ€™Artagnan thought he perceived in an obscure
corner a discipline cord suspended from a nail in the wall.
At the noise made by dâ€™Artagnan in entering, Aramis lifted up his head,
and beheld his friend; but to the great astonishment of the young man,
the sight of him did not produce much effect upon the Musketeer, so
completely was his mind detached from the things of this world.

Dâ€™Artagnan, whose erudition we are well acquainted with, evinced no more

greatly delighted, turned upon dâ€™Artagnan a look full of gratitude.
â€œWell, let us see what is to be derived from this gloss. Moses, the
servant of God-he was but a servant, please to understand-Moses blessed
with the hands; he held out both his arms while the Hebrews beat their
enemies, and then he blessed them with his two hands. Besides, what does
the Gospel say? IMPONITE MANUS, and not MANUM-place the HANDS, not the

All crossed themselves. Dâ€™Artagnan thought it was proper to follow this
example.
â€œThe Pope is the successor of St. Peter, and represents the three divine
powers; the rest-ORDINES INFERIORES-of the ecclesiastical hierarchy
bless in the name of the holy archangels and angels. The most humble
clerks such as our deacons and sacristans, bless with holy water
sprinklers, which resemble an infinite number of blessing fingers. There

Dâ€™Artagnan, who for an hour past had been gnawing his nails with
impatience, was beginning to attack the quick.
The two men in black rose, bowed to Aramis and dâ€™Artagnan, and advanced
toward the door. Bazin, who had been standing listening to all this
controversy with a pious jubilation, sprang toward them, took the
breviary of the curate and the missal of the Jesuit, and walked
respectfully before them to clear their way.
Aramis conducted them to the foot of the stairs, and then immediately
came up again to dâ€™Artagnan, whose senses were still in a state of
confusion.
When left alone, the two friends at first kept an embarrassed silence.
It however became necessary for one of them to break it first, and as
dâ€™Artagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion,

â€œI had been at the seminary from nine years old; in three days I should
have been twenty. I was about to become an abbe, and all was arranged.
One evening I went, according to custom, to a house which I frequented
with much pleasure: when one is young, what can be expected?--one is
weak. An officer who saw me, with a jealous eye, reading the LIVES OF
THE SAINTS to the mistress of the house, entered suddenly and without
being announced. That evening I had translated an episode of Judith, and
had just communicated my verses to the lady, who gave me all sorts of
compliments, and leaning on my shoulder, was reading them a second time
with me. Her pose, which I must admit was rather free, wounded this
officer. He said nothing; but when I went out he followed, and quickly
came up with me. â€˜Monsieur the Abbe,â€™ said he, â€˜do you like blows with a
cane?â€™ â€˜I cannot say, monsieur,â€™ answered I; â€˜no one has ever dared to
give me any.â€™ â€˜Well, listen to me, then, Monsieur the Abbe! If you
venture again into the house in which I have met you this evening, I
will dare it myself.â€™ I really think I must have been frightened. I
became very pale; I felt my legs fail me; I sought for a reply, but
could find none-I was silent. The officer waited for his reply, and
seeing it so long coming, he burst into a laugh, turned upon his heel,
and re-entered the house. I returned to the seminary.
â€œI am a gentleman born, and my blood is warm, as you may have remarked,
my dear dâ€™Artagnan. The insult was terrible, and although unknown to the
rest of the world, I felt it live and fester at the bottom of my heart.
I informed my superiors that I did not feel myself sufficiently prepared
for ordination, and at my request the ceremony was postponed for a year.
I sought out the best fencing master in Paris, I made an agreement with
him to take a lesson every day, and every day for a year I took that
lesson. Then, on the anniversary of the day on which I had been
insulted, I hung my cassock on a peg, assumed the costume of a cavalier,
and went to a ball given by a lady friend of mine and to which I knew my
man was invited. It was in the Rue des France-Bourgeois, close to La
Force. As I expected, my officer was there. I went up to him as he was
singing a love ditty and looking tenderly at a lady, and interrupted him
exactly in the middle of the second couplet. â€˜Monsieur,â€™ said I, â€˜does
it still displease you that I should frequent a certain house of La Rue
Payenne? And would you still cane me if I took it into my head to
disobey you? The officer looked at me with astonishment, and then said,
â€˜What is your business with me, monsieur? I do not know you.â€™ â€˜I am,â€™
said I, â€˜the little abbe who reads LIVES OF THE SAINTS, and translates
Judith into verse.â€™ â€˜Ah, ah! I recollect now,â€™ said the officer, in a
jeering tone; â€˜well, what do you want with me?â€™ â€˜I want you to spare
time to take a walk with me.â€™ â€˜Tomorrow morning, if you like, with the
greatest pleasure.â€™ â€˜No, not tomorrow morning, if you please, but
immediately.â€™ â€˜If you absolutely insist.â€™ â€˜I do insist upon it.â€™ â€˜Come,
then. Ladies,â€™ said the officer, â€˜do not disturb yourselves; allow me
time just to kill this gentleman, and I will return and finish the last
couplet.â€™
â€œWe went out. I took him to the Rue Payenne, to exactly the same spot
where, a year before, at the very same hour, he had paid me the
compliment I have related to you. It was a superb moonlight night. We
NA
NA
NA
back, and as he was found in the Rue Payenne with a great sword wound
through his body, it was supposed that I had accommodated him thus; and
the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock
for a time. Athos, whose acquaintance I made about that period, and
Porthos, who had in addition to my lessons taught me some effective
tricks of fence, prevailed upon me to solicit the uniform of a
Musketeer. The king entertained great regard for my father, who had
fallen at the siege of Arras, and the uniform was granted. You may
understand that the moment has come for me to re-enter the bosom of the

Bazin sighed.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, but my poor Bazin, reflect a little. Of what use is it to be a
churchman, pray? You do not avoid going to war by that means; you see,
the cardinal is about to make the next campaign, helm on head and
partisan in hand. And Monsieur de Nogaret de la Valette, what do you say
of him? He is a cardinal likewise. Ask his lackey how often he has had

curvets of the noble animal his rider felt his pains come on so
insupportably that he turned pale and became unsteady in his seat.
Dâ€™Artagnan, who, foreseeing such an event, had kept his eye on him,
sprang toward him, caught him in his arms, and assisted him to his
chamber.
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo, I have good luck, that is all. But how do you mean to pass your
time till I come back? No more theses, no more glosses upon the fingers

They took leave of each other, and in ten minutes, after having

How was he going to find Athos? Should he find him at all? The position
in which he had left him was critical. He probably had succumbed. This
idea, while darkening his brow, drew several sighs from him, and caused
him to formulate to himself a few vows of vengeance. Of all his friends,
Athos was the eldest, and the least resembling him in appearance, in his
tastes and sympathies.
Yet he entertained a marked preference for this gentleman. The noble and
distinguished air of Athos, those flashes of greatness which from time
to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself,
that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant
companion in the world, that forced and cynical gaiety, that bravery
which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the
rarest coolness--such qualities attracted more than the esteem, more
than the friendship of dâ€™Artagnan; they attracted his admiration.
Indeed, when placed beside M. de Treville, the elegant and noble
courtier, Athos in his most cheerful days might advantageously sustain a
comparison. He was of middle height; but his person was so admirably
shaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles
with Porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was
proverbial among the Musketeers. His head, with piercing eyes, a
straight nose, a chin cut like that of Brutus, had altogether an
indefinable character of grandeur and grace. His hands, of which he took
little care, were the despair of Aramis, who cultivated his with almond
paste and perfumed oil. The sound of his voice was at once penetrating
and melodious; and then, that which was inconceivable in Athos, who was
always retiring, was that delicate knowledge of the world and of the
usages of the most brilliant society--those manners of a high degree
which appeared, as if unconsciously to himself, in his least actions.
If a repast were on foot, Athos presided over it better than any other,
placing every guest exactly in the rank which his ancestors had earned
for him or that he had made for himself. If a question in heraldry were
started, Athos knew all the noble families of the kingdom, their
genealogy, their alliances, their coats of arms, and the origin of them.
Etiquette had no minutiae unknown to him. He knew what were the rights
of the great land owners. He was profoundly versed in hunting and
falconry, and had one day when conversing on this great art astonished
even Louis XIII himself, who took a pride in being considered a past
master therein.
Like all the great nobles of that period, Athos rode and fenced to
perfection. But still further, his education had been so little
neglected, even with respect to scholastic studies, so rare at this time
among gentlemen, that he smiled at the scraps of Latin which Aramis
sported and which Porthos pretended to understand. Two or three times,
even, to the great astonishment of his friends, he had, when Aramis
allowed some rudimental error to escape him, replaced a verb in its
right tense and a noun in its case. Besides, his probity was
irreproachable, in an age in which soldiers compromised so easily with
their religion and their consciences, lovers with the rigorous delicacy
of our era, and the poor with Godâ€™s Seventh Commandment. This Athos,
then, was a very extraordinary man.
And yet this nature so distinguished, this creature so beautiful, this
essence so fine, was seen to turn insensibly toward material life, as
old men turn toward physical and moral imbecility. Athos, in his hours
of gloom--and these hours were frequent--was extinguished as to the
whole of the luminous portion of him, and his brilliant side disappeared
as into profound darkness.
Then the demigod vanished; he remained scarcely a man. His head hanging
down, his eye dull, his speech slow and painful, Athos would look for
hours together at his bottle, his glass, or at Grimaud, who, accustomed
to obey him by signs, read in the faint glance of his master his least
desire, and satisfied it immediately. If the four friends were assembled
at one of these moments, a word, thrown forth occasionally with a
violent effort, was the share Athos furnished to the conversation. In
exchange for his silence Athos drank enough for four, and without
appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more marked
constriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness.
Dâ€™Artagnan, whose inquiring disposition we are acquainted with, had
not--whatever interest he had in satisfying his curiosity on this
subject--been able to assign any cause for these fits, or for the
periods of their recurrence. Athos never received any letters; Athos
never had concerns which all his friends did not know.
It could not be said that it was wine which produced this sadness; for
in truth he only drank to combat this sadness, which wine however, as we
have said, rendered still darker. This excess of bilious humor could not
be attributed to play; for unlike Porthos, who accompanied the
variations of chance with songs or oaths, Athos when he won remained as
unmoved as when he lost. He had been known, in the circle of the
Musketeers, to win in one night three thousand pistoles; to lose them
even to the gold-embroidered belt for gala days, win all this again with
the addition of a hundred louis, without his beautiful eyebrow being
heightened or lowered half a line, without his hands losing their pearly
hue, without his conversation, which was cheerful that evening, ceasing
to be calm and agreeable.
Neither was it, as with our neighbors, the English, an atmospheric
influence which darkened his countenance; for the sadness generally
became more intense toward the fine season of the year. June and July
were the terrible months with Athos.
For the present he had no anxiety. He shrugged his shoulders when people
spoke of the future. His secret, then, was in the past, as had often
been vaguely said to dâ€™Artagnan.
This mysterious shade, spread over his whole person, rendered still more
interesting the man whose eyes or mouth, even in the most complete
intoxication, had never revealed anything, however skillfully questions
had been put to him.
NA
and dead by my fault--for it was I who dragged him into this affair, of
which he did not know the origin, of which he is ignorant of the result,
NA
NA
expressed reflections, â€œthat we perhaps owe our lives to him. Do you
remember how he cried, â€˜On, dâ€™Artagnan, on, I am takenâ€™? And when he had
discharged his two pistols, what a terrible noise he made with his
sword! One might have said that twenty men, or rather twenty mad devils,
NA
These words redoubled the eagerness of dâ€™Artagnan, who urged his horse,
though he stood in need of no incitement, and they proceeded at a rapid
pace. About eleven oâ€™clock in the morning they perceived Amiens, and at
half past eleven they were at the door of the cursed inn.
Dâ€™Artagnan had often meditated against the perfidious host one of those
hearty vengeances which offer consolation while they are hoped for. He
entered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes, his left hand on
the pommel of the sword, and cracking his whip with his right hand.
NA
NA
dazzled by the brilliant style in which dâ€™Artagnan traveled.
NA
NA
â€œWell, two words will refresh your memory. What have you done with that
gentleman against whom you had the audacity, about twelve days ago, to

The host became as pale as death; for dâ€™Artagnan had assumed a
threatening attitude, and Planchet modeled himself after his master.
NA
pitiable voice imaginable. â€œAh, monseigneur, how dearly have I paid for
NA
NA
â€œDeign to listen to me, monseigneur, and be merciful! Sit down, in

Dâ€™Artagnan, mute with anger and anxiety, took a seat in the threatening
attitude of a judge. Planchet glared fiercely over the back of his
armchair.
NA
recollect you. It was you who rode off at the moment I had that
NA
â€œYes, it was I; so you may plainly perceive that you have no mercy to

NA
NA
â€œI had been warned by the authorities that a celebrated coiner of bad
money would arrive at my inn, with several of his companions, all
disguised as Guards or Musketeers. Monseigneur, I was furnished with a
description of your horses, your lackeys, your countenances--nothing was
NA
NA
exact description had come.
â€œI took then, in conformity with the orders of the authorities, who sent
me a reinforcement of six men, such measures as I thought necessary to
NA
NA
repetition of this word COINERs.
â€œPardon me, monseigneur, for saying such things, but they form my
excuse. The authorities had terrified me, and you know that an innkeeper

â€œBut once again, that gentleman--where is he? What has become of him? Is

â€œPatience, monseigneur, we are coming to it. There happened then that
NA
host, with an acuteness that did not escape dâ€™Artagnan, â€œappeared to
authorize the issue. That gentleman, your friend, defended himself
desperately. His lackey, who, by an unforeseen piece of ill luck, had
NA
NA
then! And I really donâ€™t know what prevents me from exterminating you
NA
â€œAlas, monseigneur, we were not in the plot, as you will soon see.
Monsieur your friend (pardon for not calling him by the honorable name
which no doubt he bears, but we do not know that name), Monsieur your
friend, having disabled two men with his pistols, retreated fighting
with his sword, with which he disabled one of my men, and stunned me
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhile fighting and retreating, as I have told Monseigneur, he found the
door of the cellar stairs behind him, and as the door was open, he took
out the key, and barricaded himself inside. As we were sure of finding
NA
NA
NA
â€œGood God! To imprison him, monseigneur? Why, he imprisoned himself, I
swear to you he did. In the first place he had made rough work of it;
one man was killed on the spot, and two others were severely wounded.
The dead man and the two wounded were carried off by their comrades, and
I have heard nothing of either of them since. As for myself, as soon as
I recovered my senses I went to Monsieur the Governor, to whom I related
all that had passed, and asked, what I should do with my prisoner.
Monsieur the Governor was all astonishment. He told me he knew nothing
about the matter, that the orders I had received did not come from him,
and that if I had the audacity to mention his name as being concerned in
this disturbance he would have me hanged. It appears that I had made a
mistake, monsieur, that I had arrested the wrong person, and that he

NA
NA
NA
the innkeeper, â€œI took my way straight to the cellar in order to set him
at liberty. Ah, monsieur, he was no longer a man, he was a devil! To my
offer of liberty, he replied that it was nothing but a snare, and that
before he came out he intended to impose his own conditions. I told him
very humbly--for I could not conceal from myself the scrape I had got
into by laying hands on one of his Majestyâ€™s Musketeers--I told him I
was quite ready to submit to his conditions.
â€œâ€˜In the first place,â€™ said he, â€˜I wish my lackey placed with me, fully
armed.â€™ We hastened to obey this order; for you will please to
understand, monsieur, we were disposed to do everything your friend
could desire. Monsieur Grimaud (he told us his name, although he does
not talk much)--Monsieur Grimaud, then, went down to the cellar, wounded
as he was; then his master, having admitted him, barricaded the door
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œMerciful heaven! No, monsieur! We keep him in the cellar! You do not
know what he is about in the cellar. Ah! If you could but persuade him
to come out, monsieur, I should owe you the gratitude of my whole life;
NA
NA
â€œWithout doubt you will, monsieur; he persists in remaining there. We
every day pass through the air hole some bread at the end of a fork, and
some meat when he asks for it; but alas! It is not of bread and meat of
which he makes the greatest consumption. I once endeavored to go down
with two of my servants; but he flew into terrible rage. I heard the
noise he made in loading his pistols, and his servant in loading his
musketoon. Then, when we asked them what were their intentions, the
master replied that he had forty charges to fire, and that he and his
lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow a single soul of
us to set foot in the cellar. Upon this I went and complained to the
governor, who replied that I only had what I deserved, and that it would
teach me to insult honorable gentlemen who took up their abode in my
NA
NA
refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the host.
NA
most miserable life imaginable; for you must know, monsieur, that all
our provisions are in the cellar. There is our wine in bottles, and our
wine in casks; the beer, the oil, and the spices, the bacon, and
sausages. And as we are prevented from going down there, we are forced
to refuse food and drink to the travelers who come to the house; so that
our hostelry is daily going to ruin. If your friend remains another week
NA
â€œAnd not more than justice, either, you ass! Could you not perceive by
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, the English like good wine, as you may know, monsieur; these have
asked for the best. My wife has perhaps requested permission of Monsieur
Athos to go into the cellar to satisfy these gentlemen; and he, as
usual, has refused. Ah, good heaven! There is the hullabaloo louder than
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan, in fact, heard a great noise on the side next the cellar. He
rose, and preceded by the host wringing his hands, and followed by
Planchet with his musketoon ready for use, he approached the scene of
action.
The two gentlemen were exasperated; they had had a long ride, and were
dying with hunger and thirst.
NA
with a foreign accent, â€œthat this madman will not allow these good
people access to their own wine! Nonsense, let us break open the door,
NA
NA
NA
NA
door, â€œlet them just come in, these devourers of little children, and we

Brave as they appeared to be, the two English gentlemen looked at each
other hesitatingly. One might have thought there was in that cellar one
of those famished ogres--the gigantic heroes of popular legends, into
whose cavern nobody could force their way with impunity.
There was a moment of silence; but at length the two Englishmen felt
ashamed to draw back, and the angrier one descended the five or six
steps which led to the cellar, and gave a kick against the door enough
to split a wall.
NA
the one at the top; you look to the one below. Ah, gentlemen, you want
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The gentlemen had drawn their swords, but they found themselves taken
between two fires. They still hesitated an instant; but, as before,
pride prevailed, and a second kick split the door from bottom to top.
NA
NA
NA
â€œgentlemen, think of what you are about. Patience, Athos! You are
running your heads into a very silly affair; you will be riddled. My
lackey and I will have three shots at you, and you will get as many from
the cellar. You will then have our swords, with which, I can assure you,
my friend and I can play tolerably well. Let me conduct your business
NA
NA
The host felt a cold sweat creep down his back.
NA
NA
satisfied of that; these two cannot have drunk all the cellar.
NA
NA
NA
And dâ€™Artagnan set the example. Then, turning toward Planchet, he made
him a sign to uncock his musketoon.
The Englishmen, convinced of these peaceful proceedings, sheathed their
swords grumblingly. The history of Athosâ€™s imprisonment was then related
to them; and as they were really gentlemen, they pronounced the host in
the wrong.
NA
NA
The Englishmen bowed and went upstairs.
NA
NA
NA
Then was heard a great noise of fagots being removed and of the groaning
of posts; these were the counterscarps and bastions of Athos, which the
besieged himself demolished.
An instant after, the broken door was removed, and the pale face of
Athos appeared, who with a rapid glance took a survey of the
surroundings.
Dâ€™Artagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tenderly. He then
tried to draw him from his moist abode, but to his surprise he perceived
that Athos staggered.
NA
â€œI! Not at all. I am dead drunk, thatâ€™s all, and never did a man more
strongly set about getting so. By the Lord, my good host! I must at
NA
NA
NA
â€œGrimaud is a well-bred lackey. He would never think of faring in the
same manner as his master; he only drank from the cask. Hark! I donâ€™t
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan burst into a laugh which changed the shiver of the host into
a burning fever.
In the meantime, Grimaud appeared in his turn behind his master, with
the musketoon on his shoulder, and his head shaking. Like one of those
drunken satyrs in the pictures of Rubens. He was moistened before and
behind with a greasy liquid which the host recognized as his best olive
oil.
The four crossed the public room and proceeded to take possession of the
best apartment in the house, which dâ€™Artagnan occupied with authority.
In the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the
cellar, which had so long been interdicted to them and where a frightful
spectacle awaited them.
Beyond the fortifications through which Athos had made a breach in order
to get out, and which were composed of fagots, planks, and empty casks,
heaped up according to all the rules of the strategic art, they found,
swimming in puddles of oil and wine, the bones and fragments of all the
hams they had eaten; while a heap of broken bottles filled the whole
left-hand corner of the cellar, and a tun, the cock of which was left
running, was yielding, by this means, the last drop of its blood. â€œThe
NA
NA
Of fifty large sausages, suspended from the joists, scarcely ten
remained.
Then the lamentations of the host and hostess pierced the vault of the
cellar. Dâ€™Artagnan himself was moved by them. Athos did not even turn
his head.
To grief succeeded rage. The host armed himself with a spit, and rushed
into the chamber occupied by the two friends.
NA
NA
more than a hundred pistolesâ€™ worth! I am a ruined man, lost,
NA
NA
â€œIf you had been contented with drinking, well and good; but you have
NA
NA
NA
â€œOil is a sovereign balm for wounds; and my poor Grimaud here was

NA
NA
NA
NA
had tried his strength to the utmost. Dâ€™Artagnan came to his relief with
his whip in his hand.
The host drew back and burst into tears.
NA
NA
NA
NA
will all four go and shut ourselves up in your cellar, and we will see
NA
NA
pardon to every sin! You are gentlemen, and I am a poor innkeeper. You
NA
NA
and the tears will flow from my eyes as the wine flowed from the cask.
We are not such devils as we appear to be. Come hither, and let us
NA
The host approached with hesitation.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œBut Monseigneur knows very well that justice never lets go that which
it once lays hold of. If it were bad money, there might be some hopes;
NA
â€œManage the matter as well as you can, my good man; it does not concern
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, since there is another finer and younger, why, you may take the
NA
NA
â€œSome of that at the bottom, near the laths. There are twenty-five
bottles of it left; all the rest were broken by my fall. Bring six of
NA
NA
here a fortnight, and pays for what he drinks, I shall soon re-establish

NA
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan related how he had found Porthos in bed with a strained knee,
and Aramis at a table between two theologians. As he finished, the host
entered with the wine ordered and a ham which, fortunately for him, had
been left out of the cellar.
NA
â€œhereâ€™s to Porthos and Aramis! But you, dâ€™Artagnan, what is the matter
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œPresently! And why presently? Because you think I am drunk? Dâ€™Artagnan,
remember this! My ideas are never so clear as when I have had plenty of

Dâ€™Artagnan related his adventure with Mme. Bonacieux. Athos listened to
him without a frown; and when he had finished, said, â€œTrifles, only
NA
NA
NA
The drink-deadened eye of Athos flashed out, but only for a moment; it
became as dull and vacant as before.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI say that love is a lottery in which he who wins, wins death! You are
very fortunate to have lost, believe me, my dear dâ€™Artagnan. And if I
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou child, why, there is not a man who has not believed, as you do,
that his mistress loved him, and there lives not a man who has not been

NA
NA
NA
NA
should like to know what you would say if I were to relate to you a real

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Athos collected himself, and in proportion as he did so, dâ€™Artagnan saw
that he became pale. He was at that period of intoxication in which
vulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to sleep. He kept himself
upright and dreamed, without sleeping. This somnambulism of drunkenness
had something frightful in it.
NA
NA
â€œBe it then as you desire. One of my friends--one of my friends, please
NA
melancholy smile, â€œone of the counts of my province--that is to say, of
Berry--noble as a Dandolo or a Montmorency, at twenty-five years of age
fell in love with a girl of sixteen, beautiful as fancy can paint.
Through the ingenuousness of her age beamed an ardent mind, not of the
woman, but of the poet. She did not please; she intoxicated. She lived
in a small town with her brother, who was a curate. Both had recently
come into the country. They came nobody knew whence; but when seeing her
so lovely and her brother so pious, nobody thought of asking whence they
came. They were said, however, to be of good extraction. My friend, who
was seigneur of the country, might have seduced her, or taken her by
force, at his will--for he was master. Who would have come to the
assistance of two strangers, two unknown persons? Unfortunately he was
NA
NA
NA
lady in the province; and in justice it must be allowed that she
NA
NA
NA
in a low voice, and speaking very quickly, â€œshe fell from her horse and
fainted. The count flew to her to help, and as she appeared to be
oppressed by her clothes, he ripped them open with his poniard, and in
NA
NA
NA
NA
Athos emptied at a single draught the glass he held in his hand.
NA
â€œTruth, my friend. The angel was a demon; the poor young girl had stolen
NA
NA
â€œThe count was of the highest nobility. He had on his estates the rights
of high and low tribunals. He tore the dress of the countess to pieces;
NA
NA
NA
and he seized by the neck the last bottle that was left, put it to his
mouth, and emptied it at a single draught, as he would have emptied an
ordinary glass.
Then he let his head sink upon his two hands, while dâ€™Artagnan stood
before him, stupefied.
NA
Athos, after a considerable pause, raising his head, and forgetting to
continue the fiction of the count. â€œGod grant you as much! Let us

NA

NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œOh, I inquired after him for the purpose of hanging him likewise; but

worthy man, who had pretended to be a curate for the purpose of getting
his mistress married, and securing her a position. He has been hanged

â€œWhat a pity it is there were only four like this in the cellar. I could

Dâ€™Artagnan could no longer endure this conversation, which had made him
bewildered. Allowing his head to sink upon his two hands, he pretended
to sleep.

28 THE RETURN
Dâ€™Artagnan was astounded by the terrible confidence of Athos; yet many
things appeared very obscure to him in this half revelation. In the
first place it had been made by a man quite drunk to one who was half
drunk; and yet, in spite of the incertainty which the vapor of three or
four bottles of Burgundy carries with it to the brain, dâ€™Artagnan, when
awaking on the following morning, had all the words of Athos as present
to his memory as if they then fell from his mouth--they had been so
impressed upon his mind. All this doubt only gave rise to a more lively
desire of arriving at a certainty, and he went into his friendâ€™s chamber
with a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the preceding
evening; but he found Athos quite himself again--that is to say, the
most shrewd and impenetrable of men. Besides which, the Musketeer, after
having exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with him, broached the
matter first.
NA
my tongue, which was swollen and hot this morning, and by my pulse,
which was very tremulous. I wager that I uttered a thousand

While saying this he looked at his friend with an earnestness that
embarrassed him.
NA
NA
NA
And he looked at the young man as if he would read the bottom of his
heart.
NA
NA
Athos did not trust this reply, and he resumed; â€œyou cannot have failed
to remark, my dear friend, that everyone has his particular kind of
drunkenness, sad or gay. My drunkenness is always sad, and when I am
thoroughly drunk my mania is to relate all the lugubrious stories which
my foolish nurse inculcated into my brain. That is my failing--a capital
NA
Athos spoke this in so natural a manner that dâ€™Artagnan was shaken in
his conviction.
NA
truth, â€œit is that, then, I remember as we remember a dream. We were
NA
NA
attempting to laugh; â€œI was sure it was so--the hanging of people is my

NA

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
dâ€™Artagnan, looking intently at Athos.
â€œWell, you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know
NA
himself an object of pity. â€œI certainly never will get drunk again,
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan remained silent; and then changing the conversation all at
once, Athos said:
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou are mistaken; I rode him nearly ten leagues in less than an hour
and a half, and he appeared no more distressed than if he had only made
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhy, here is the simple fact. This morning I awoke at six oâ€™clock. You
were still fast asleep, and I did not know what to do with myself; I was
still stupid from our yesterdayâ€™s debauch. As I came into the public
room, I saw one of our Englishman bargaining with a dealer for a horse,
his own having died yesterday from bleeding. I drew near, and found he
was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut nag. â€˜PARDIEU,â€™ said I,
â€˜my good gentleman, I have a horse to sell, too.â€™ â€˜Ay, and a very fine
one! I saw him yesterday; your friendâ€™s lackey was leading him.â€™ â€˜Do you
think he is worth a hundred pistoles?â€™ â€˜Yes! Will you sell him to me for
that sum?â€™ â€˜No; but I will play for him.â€™ â€˜What?â€™ â€˜At dice.â€™ No sooner
said than done, and I lost the horse. Ah, ah! But please to observe I

Dâ€™Artagnan looked much disconcerted.
NA
NA
have identified us in the day of battle. It was a pledge, a remembrance.
NA
NA
â€œI was hipped to death; and still further, upon my honor, I donâ€™t like
English horses. If it is only to be recognized, why the saddle will
suffice for that; it is quite remarkable enough. As to the horse, we can
easily find some excuse for its disappearance. Why the devil! A horse is

Dâ€™Artagnan did not smile.
NA
NA
NA
â€œAfter having lost my own horse, nine against ten--see how near--I

â€œMy dear lad, that was yesterday, when I was telling you silly stories,
it was proper to tell me that, and not this morning. I lost him then,
NA
NA
â€œStop a minute; you donâ€™t know all yet. I should make an excellent
gambler if I were not too hot-headed; but I was hot-headed, just as if I

NA
â€œOh, yes, my friend; there was still that diamond left which sparkles on

NA
â€œAnd as I am a connoisseur in such things, having had a few of my own

NA
â€œOn the contrary, my dear friend, this diamond became our only resource;
with it I might regain our horses and their harnesses, and even money to

NA
â€œI mentioned your diamond then to my adversary, who had likewise
remarked it. What the devil, my dear, do you think you can wear a star

NA
NA
anger began to take by the hair, as Minerva takes Achilles, in the
ILLIAD.
â€œNo, I do not jest, MORDIEU! I should like to have seen you in my place!
I had been fifteen days without seeing a human face, and had been left
NA
NA
his hand with a nervous spasm.
â€œHear the end. Ten parts of a hundred pistoles each, in ten throws,
without revenge; in thirteen throws I had lost all--in thirteen throws.
The number thirteen was always fatal to me; it was on the thirteenth of

present day making him forget that of the preceding one.

me that he had made him proposals to enter into his service. I staked

Dâ€™Artagnan breathed as if the whole hostelry had been removed from his
breast.

NA
â€œWell; the Englishman and his companion are still here. I remarked that
he regretted the horse furniture very much. You appear to think much of
your horse. In your place I would stake the furniture against the

Athos went in quest of the Englishman, whom he found in the stable,
examining the harnesses with a greedy eye. The opportunity was good. He
proposed the conditions--the two harnesses, either against one horse or
a hundred pistoles. The Englishman calculated fast; the two harnesses
were worth three hundred pistoles. He consented.
Dâ€™Artagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand, and turned up the
number three; his paleness terrified Athos, who, however, consented
himself with saying, â€œThatâ€™s a sad throw, comrade; you will have the

The Englishman, quite triumphant, did not even give himself the trouble
to shake the dice. He threw them on the table without looking at them,

humor.

The Englishman looked, and was seized with astonishment. Dâ€™Artagnan
looked, and was seized with pleasure.

prancing along by my side on that magnificent charger. For my part, I
should not hesitate a moment; I should take the hundred pistoles. We

Dâ€™Artagnan only required one reason to be satisfied. This last reason
appeared convincing. Besides, he feared that by resisting longer he
should appear selfish in the eyes of Athos. He acquiesced, therefore,
and chose the hundred pistoles, which the Englishman paid down on the
spot.
They then determined to depart. Peace with the landlord, in addition to
Athosâ€™s old horse, cost six pistoles. Dâ€™Artagnan and Athos took the nags
of Planchet and Grimaud, and the two lackeys started on foot, carrying
the saddles on their heads.
However ill our two friends were mounted, they were soon far in advance
of their servants, and arrived at Creveccoeur. From a distance they
perceived Aramis, seated in a melancholy manner at his window, looking
out, like Sister Anne, at the dust in the horizon.

At the same instant a market cart, which some minutes before had
appeared upon the Amiens road, pulled up at the inn, and Planchet and
Grimaud came out of it with the saddles on their heads. The cart was
returning empty to Paris, and the two lackeys had agreed, for their
transport, to slake the wagonerâ€™s thirst along the route.

are going to rejoin that good fellow, Porthos. So much the better. You
canâ€™t think how I have missed him, the great simpleton. To see him so
self-satisfied reconciles me with myself. He would not sell his horse;
not for a kingdom! I think I can see him now, mounted upon his superb
animal and seated in his handsome saddle. I am sure he will look like

They made a halt for an hour to refresh their horses. Aramis discharged
his bill, placed Bazin in the cart with his comrades, and they set
forward to join Porthos.
They found him up, less pale than when dâ€™Artagnan left him after his
first visit, and seated at a table on which, though he was alone, was
spread enough for four persons. This dinner consisted of meats nicely
dressed, choice wines, and superb fruit.

NA
The friends, at ease with regard to the future, did honor to the repast,
the remains of which were abandoned to Mousqueton, Bazin, Planchet, and
Grimaud.
On arriving in Paris, dâ€™Artagnan found a letter from M. de Treville,
which informed him that, at his request, the king had promised that he
should enter the company of the Musketeers.
As this was the height of dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s worldly ambition--apart, be it
well understood, from his desire of finding Mme. Bonacieux--he ran, full
of joy, to seek his comrades, whom he had left only half an hour before,
but whom he found very sad and deeply preoccupied. They were assembled
in council at the residence of Athos, which always indicated an event of
some gravity. M. de Treville had intimated to them his Majestyâ€™s fixed
intention to open the campaign on the first of May, and they must
immediately prepare their outfits.
The four philosophers looked at one another in a state of bewilderment.
M. de Treville never jested in matters relating to discipline.
NA
â€œOh, we can scarcely say. We have made our calculations with Spartan
NA
NA

coolly; â€œbut as to dâ€™Artagnan, gentlemen, the idea of belonging to OURS

NA
29 HUNTING FOR THE EQUIPMENTS
The most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly dâ€™Artagnan,
although he, in his quality of Guardsman, would be much more easily
equipped than Messieurs the Musketeers, who were all of high rank; but
our Gascon cadet was, as may have been observed, of a provident and
almost avaricious character, and with that (explain the contradiction)
so vain as almost to rival Porthos. To this preoccupation of his vanity,
dâ€™Artagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish.
Notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting Mme. Bonacieux, he could
obtain no intelligence of her. M. de Treville had spoken of her to the
queen. The queen was ignorant where the mercerâ€™s young wife was, but had
promised to have her sought for; but this promise was very vague and did
not at all reassure dâ€™Artagnan.
Athos did not leave his chamber; he made up his mind not to take a
single step to equip himself.
NA
if at the end of a fortnight I have found nothing, or rather if nothing
has come to find me, as I, too good a Catholic to kill myself with a
pistol bullet, I will seek a good quarrel with four of his Eminenceâ€™s
Guards or with eight Englishmen, and I will fight until one of them has
killed me, which, considering the number, cannot fail to happen. It will
then be said of me that I died for the king; so that I shall have

Porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him, tossing his
NA
Aramis, anxious and negligently dressed, said nothing.
It may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in
the community.
The lackeys on their part, like the coursers of Hippolytus, shared the
sadness of their masters. Mousqueton collected a store of crusts; Bazin,
who had always been inclined to devotion, never quit the churches;
Planchet watched the flight of flies; and Grimaud, whom the general
distress could not induce to break the silence imposed by his master,
heaved sighs enough to soften the stones.
The three friends--for, as we have said, Athos had sworn not to stir a
foot to equip himself--went out early in the morning, and returned late
at night. They wandered about the streets, looking at the pavement as if
to see whether the passengers had not left a purse behind them. They
might have been supposed to be following tracks, so observant were they
wherever they went. When they met they looked desolately at one another,
NA
However, as Porthos had first found an idea, and had thought of it
earnestly afterward, he was the first to act. He was a man of execution,
this worthy Porthos. Dâ€™Artagnan perceived him one day walking toward the
church of St. Leu, and followed him instinctively. He entered, after
having twisted his mustache and elongated his imperial, which always
announced on his part the most triumphant resolutions. As dâ€™Artagnan
took some precautions to conceal himself, Porthos believed he had not
been seen. Dâ€™Artagnan entered behind him. Porthos went and leaned
against the side of a pillar. Dâ€™Artagnan, still unperceived, supported
himself against the other side.
There happened to be a sermon, which made the church very full of
people. Porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the women.
Thanks to the cares of Mousqueton, the exterior was far from announcing
the distress of the interior. His hat was a little napless, his feather
was a little faded, his gold lace was a little tarnished, his laces were
a trifle frayed; but in the obscurity of the church these things were
not seen, and Porthos was still the handsome Porthos.
Dâ€™Artagnan observed, on the bench nearest to the pillar against which
Porthos leaned, a sort of ripe beauty, rather yellow and rather dry, but
erect and haughty under her black hood. The eyes of Porthos were
furtively cast upon this lady, and then roved about at large over the
nave.
On her side the lady, who from time to time blushed, darted with the
rapidity of lightning a glance toward the inconstant Porthos; and then
immediately the eyes of Porthos wandered anxiously. It was plain that
this mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood, for she bit
her lips till they bled, scratched the end of her nose, and could not
sit still in her seat.
Porthos, seeing this, retwisted his mustache, elongated his imperial a
second time, and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near
the choir, and who not only was a beautiful lady, but still further, no
doubt, a great lady--for she had behind her a Negro boy who had brought
the cushion on which she knelt, and a female servant who held the
emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the
Mass.
The lady with the black hood followed through all their wanderings the
looks of Porthos, and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the
velvet cushion, the little Negro, and the maid-servant.
During this time Porthos played close. It was almost imperceptible
motions of his eyes, fingers placed upon the lips, little assassinating
smiles, which really did assassinate the disdained beauty.
NA
breast so vigorously that everybody, even the lady with the red cushion,
turned round toward her. Porthos paid no attention. Nevertheless, he
understood it all, but was deaf.
The lady with the red cushion produced a great effect--for she was very
handsome--upon the lady with the black hood, who saw in her a rival
really to be dreaded; a great effect upon Porthos, who thought her much
prettier than the lady with the black hood; a great effect upon
dâ€™Artagnan, who recognized in her the lady of Meung, of Calais, and of
Dover, whom his persecutor, the man with the scar, had saluted by the
name of Milady.
Dâ€™Artagnan, without losing sight of the lady of the red cushion,
continued to watch the proceedings of Porthos, which amused him greatly.
He guessed that the lady of the black hood was the procuratorâ€™s wife of
the Rue aux Ours, which was the more probable from the church of St. Leu
being not far from that locality.
He guessed, likewise, by induction, that Porthos was taking his revenge
for the defeat of Chantilly, when the procuratorâ€™s wife had proved so
refractory with respect to her purse.
Amid all this, dâ€™Artagnan remarked also that not one countenance
responded to the gallantries of Porthos. There were only chimeras and
illusions; but for real love, for true jealousy, is there any reality
except illusions and chimeras?
The sermon over, the procuratorâ€™s wife advanced toward the holy font.
Porthos went before her, and instead of a finger, dipped his whole hand
in. The procuratorâ€™s wife smiled, thinking that it was for her Porthos
had put himself to this trouble; but she was cruelly and promptly
undeceived. When she was only about three steps from him, he turned his
head round, fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red
cushion, who had risen and was approaching, followed by her black boy
and her woman.
When the lady of the red cushion came close to Porthos, Porthos drew his
dripping hand from the font. The fair worshipper touched the great hand
of Porthos with her delicate fingers, smiled, made the sign of the
cross, and left the church.
This was too much for the procuratorâ€™s wife; she doubted not there was
an intrigue between this lady and Porthos. If she had been a great lady
she would have fainted; but as she was only a procuratorâ€™s wife, she
contented herself saying to the Musketeer with concentrated fury, â€œEh,
NA
Porthos, at the sound of that voice, started like a man awakened from a
sleep of a hundred years.

NA

who laughs at the dupe he is about to pluck.

glance at Porthos, and beheld this triumphant look.

Porthos, yielding to the pressure of the arm of the procuratorâ€™s wife,

children at play.

30 Dâ€™ARTAGNAN AND THE ENGLISHMAN
Dâ€™Artagnan followed Milady without being perceived by her. He saw her
get into her carriage, and heard her order the coachman to drive to St.
Germain.
It was useless to try to keep pace on foot with a carriage drawn by two
powerful horses. Dâ€™Artagnan therefore returned to the Rue Ferou.
In the Rue de Seine he met Planchet, who had stopped before the house of
a pastry cook, and was contemplating with ecstasy a cake of the most
appetizing appearance.
He ordered him to go and saddle two horses in M. de Trevilleâ€™s
stables--one for himself, dâ€™Artagnan, and one for Planchet--and bring
them to Athosâ€™s place. Once for all, Treville had placed his stable at
dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s service.
Planchet proceeded toward the Rue du Colombier, and dâ€™Artagnan toward
the Rue Ferou. Athos was at home, emptying sadly a bottle of the famous
Spanish wine he had brought back with him from his journey into Picardy.
He made a sign for Grimaud to bring a glass for dâ€™Artagnan, and Grimaud
obeyed as usual.
Dâ€™Artagnan related to Athos all that had passed at the church between
Porthos and the procuratorâ€™s wife, and how their comrade was probably by
that time in a fair way to be equipped.
NA
NA
â€œHandsome, well-bred, noble lord as you are, my dear Athos, neither
NA
NA
he made a sign to Grimaud to bring another bottle.
At that moment Planchet put his head modestly in at the half-open door,
and told his master that the horses were ready.
NA
â€œTwo horses that Monsieur de Treville lends me at my pleasure, and with
NA
NA
Athos.
Then dâ€™Artagnan described the meeting which he had at the church, and
how he had found that lady who, with the seigneur in the black cloak and
with the scar near his temple, filled his mind constantly.
â€œThat is to say, you are in love with this lady as you were with Madame
NA
pitied human weakness.
NA
mystery to which she is attached. I do not know why, but I imagine that
this woman, wholly unknown to me as she is, and wholly unknown to her as
NA
NA
is worth the trouble of being sought for when she is once lost. Madame

it at the end of the world, I would go to free her from the hands of her
enemies; but I am ignorant. All my researches have been useless. What is
NA
â€œAmuse yourself with Milady, my dear dâ€™Artagnan; I wish you may with all

NA
NA
NA
NA
any other person would have offended him, â€œI ride what I can get; I am
NA
NA
bottle he had just brought.
Dâ€™Artagnan and Planchet mounted, and took the road to St. Germain.
All along the road, what Athos had said respecting Mme. Bonacieux
recurred to the mind of the young man. Although dâ€™Artagnan was not of a
very sentimental character, the mercerâ€™s pretty wife had made a real
impression upon his heart. As he said, he was ready to go to the end of
the world to seek her; but the world, being round, has many ends, so
that he did not know which way to turn. Meantime, he was going to try to
find out Milady. Milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak;
therefore she knew him. Now, in the opinion of dâ€™Artagnan, it was
certainly the man in the black cloak who had carried off Mme. Bonacieux
the second time, as he had carried her off the first. Dâ€™Artagnan then
only half-lied, which is lying but little, when he said that by going in
search of Milady he at the same time went in search of Constance.
Thinking of all this, and from time to time giving a touch of the spur
to his horse, dâ€™Artagnan completed his short journey, and arrived at St.
Germain. He had just passed by the pavilion in which ten years later
Louis XIV was born. He rode up a very quiet street, looking to the right
and the left to see if he could catch any vestige of his beautiful
Englishwoman, when from the ground floor of a pretty house, which,
according to the fashion of the time, had no window toward the street,
he saw a face peep out with which he thought he was acquainted. This
person walked along the terrace, which was ornamented with flowers.
Planchet recognized him first.

NA
NA
the lackey of the Comte de Wardes--he whom you took such good care of a

NA
NA
â€œMy faith, monsieur, he was in such trouble that I doubt if he can have

NA
NA
Planchet dismounted and went straight up to Lubin, who did not at all
remember him, and the two lackeys began to chat with the best
understanding possible; while dâ€™Artagnan turned the two horses into a
lane, went round the house, and came back to watch the conference from
behind a hedge of filberts.
At the end of an instantâ€™s observation he heard the noise of a vehicle,
and saw Miladyâ€™s carriage stop opposite to him. He could not be
mistaken; Milady was in it. Dâ€™Artagnan leaned upon the neck of his
horse, in order that he might see without being seen.
Milady put her charming blond head out at the window, and gave her
orders to her maid.
The latter--a pretty girl of about twenty or twenty-two years, active
and lively, the true SOUBRETTE of a great lady--jumped from the step
upon which, according to the custom of the time, she was seated, and
took her way toward the terrace upon which dâ€™Artagnan had perceived
Lubin.
Dâ€™Artagnan followed the soubrette with his eyes, and saw her go toward
the terrace; but it happened that someone in the house called Lubin, so
that Planchet remained alone, looking in all directions for the road
where dâ€™Artagnan had disappeared.
The maid approached Planchet, whom she took for Lubin, and holding out a

Thereupon she ran toward the carriage, which had turned round toward the
way it came, jumped upon the step, and the carriage drove off.
Planchet turned and returned the billet. Then, accustomed to passive
obedience, he jumped down from the terrace, ran toward the lane, and at
the end of twenty paces met dâ€™Artagnan, who, having seen all, was coming
to him.

Dâ€™Artagnan opened the letter, and read these words:

â€œNo, monsieur, he is as well as a man can be with four sword wounds in

â€œWell done, Planchet! you are the king of lackeys. Now jump onto your

This did not take long. At the end of five minutes they perceived the
carriage drawn up by the roadside; a cavalier, richly dressed, was close
to the door.
The conversation between Milady and the cavalier was so animated that
dâ€™Artagnan stopped on the other side of the carriage without anyone but
the pretty SOUBRETTE perceiving his presence.
The conversation took place in English--a language which dâ€™Artagnan
could not understand; but by the accent the young man plainly saw that
the beautiful Englishwoman was in a great rage. She terminated it by an
action which left no doubt as to the nature of this conversation; this
was a blow with her fan, applied with such force that the little
feminine weapon flew into a thousand pieces.
The cavalier laughed aloud, which appeared to exasperate Milady still
more.
Dâ€™Artagnan thought this was the moment to interfere. He approached the
other door, and taking off his hat respectfully, said, â€œMadame, will you
permit me to offer you my services? It appears to me that this cavalier
has made you very angry. Speak one word, madame, and I take upon myself

At the first word Milady turned, looking at the young man with
astonishment; and when he had finished, she said in very good French,

It might be thought that Milady, timid as women are in general, would
have interposed in this commencement of mutual provocations in order to
prevent the quarrel from going too far; but on the contrary, she threw
herself back in her carriage, and called out coolly to the coachman, â€œGo
NA
The pretty SOUBRETTE cast an anxious glance at dâ€™Artagnan, whose good
looks seemed to have made an impression on her.
The carriage went on, and left the two men facing each other; no
material obstacle separated them.
The cavalier made a movement as if to follow the carriage; but
dâ€™Artagnan, whose anger, already excited, was much increased by
recognizing in him the Englishman of Amiens who had won his horse and
had been very near winning his diamond of Athos, caught at his bridle
and stopped him.

â€œYes; and that reminds me that I have a revenge to take. We will see, my

horse with the spur, he cantered back to Paris. As he was accustomed to
do in all cases of any consequence, dâ€™Artagnan went straight to the
residence of Athos.
He found Athos reclining upon a large sofa, where he was waiting, as he
said, for his outfit to come and find him. He related to Athos all that
had passed, except the letter to M. de Wardes.
Athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an Englishman. We
might say that was his dream.
They immediately sent their lackeys for Porthos and Aramis, and on their
arrival made them acquainted with the situation.
Porthos drew his sword from the scabbard, and made passes at the wall,
springing back from time to time, and making contortions like a dancer.
Aramis, who was constantly at work at his poem, shut himself up in
Athosâ€™s closet, and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of
drawing swords.
Athos, by signs, desired Grimaud to bring another bottle of wine.
Dâ€™Artagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan, of which we
shall hereafter see the execution, and which promised him some agreeable
adventure, as might be seen by the smiles which from time to time passed
over his countenance, whose thoughtfulness they animated.
31 ENGLISH AND FRENCH
The hour having come, they went with their four lackeys to a spot behind
the Luxembourg given up to the feeding of goats. Athos threw a piece of
money to the goatkeeper to withdraw. The lackeys were ordered to act as
sentinels.
A silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure, entered, and joined
the Musketeers. Then, according to foreign custom, the presentations
took place.
The Englishmen were all men of rank; consequently the odd names of their
adversaries were for them not only a matter of surprise, but of
annoyance.

four Englishmen with whom he was to fight, and communicated his name in
a low voice.
Porthos and Aramis did the same.

â€œWhy, that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not

NA
â€œBecause I am believed to be dead, and have reasons for wishing nobody

The Englishman looked at Athos, believing that he jested, but Athos did
not jest the least in the world.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun, and
the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice
enemies.
Athos fenced with as much calmness and method as if he had been
practicing in a fencing school.
Porthos, abated, no doubt, of his too-great confidence by his adventure
of Chantilly, played with skill and prudence. Aramis, who had the third
canto of his poem to finish, behaved like a man in haste.
Athos killed his adversary first. He hit him but once, but as he had
foretold, that hit was a mortal one; the sword pierced his heart.
Second, Porthos stretched his upon the grass with a wound through his
thigh, As the Englishman, without making any further resistance, then
surrendered his sword, Porthos took him up in his arms and bore him to
his carriage.
Aramis pushed his so vigorously that after going back fifty paces, the
man ended by fairly taking to his heels, and disappeared amid the
hooting of the lackeys.
As to dâ€™Artagnan, he fought purely and simply on the defensive; and when
he saw his adversary pretty well fatigued, with a vigorous side thrust
sent his sword flying. The baron, finding himself disarmed, took two or
three steps back, but in this movement his foot slipped and he fell
backward.
Dâ€™Artagnan was over him at a bound, and said to the Englishman, pointing
his sword to his throat, â€œI could kill you, my Lord, you are completely
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan was at the height of joy; he had realized the plan he had
imagined beforehand, whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted
upon his face.
The Englishman, delighted at having to do with a gentleman of such a
kind disposition, pressed dâ€™Artagnan in his arms, and paid a thousand
compliments to the three Musketeers, and as Porthosâ€™s adversary was
already installed in the carriage, and as Aramisâ€™s had taken to his
heels, they had nothing to think about but the dead.
As Porthos and Aramis were undressing him, in the hope of finding his
wound not mortal, a large purse dropped from his clothes. Dâ€™Artagnan
picked it up and offered it to Lord de Winter.
NA
NA
â€œHis family will care much about such a trifle as that! His family will
inherit fifteen thousand louis a year from him. Keep the purse for your

Dâ€™Artagnan put the purse into his pocket.
â€œAnd now, my young friend, for you will permit me, I hope, to give you

that she should take you into her good graces; and as she is not in bad
odor at court, she may perhaps on some future day speak a word that will

Dâ€™Artagnan blushed with pleasure, and bowed a sign of assent.
At this time Athos came up to dâ€™Artagnan.
NA

Porthos shrugged his shoulders; Aramis by a movement of his lips
endorsed Athos.
NA

Athos took the purse, and threw it into the hand of the coachman. â€œFor
NA
This greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even
Porthos; and this French generosity, repeated by Lord de Winter and his
friend, was highly applauded, except by MM Grimaud, Bazin, Mousqueton
and Planchet.
Lord de Winter, on quitting dâ€™Artagnan, gave him his sisterâ€™s address.
She lived in the Place Royale--then the fashionable quarter--at Number
6, and he undertook to call and take dâ€™Artagnan with him in order to
introduce him. Dâ€™Artagnan appointed eight oâ€™clock at Athosâ€™s residence.
This introduction to Milady Clarik occupied the head of our Gascon
greatly. He remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto
been mixed up in his destiny. According to his conviction, she was some
creature of the cardinal, and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn
toward her by one of those sentiments for which we cannot account. His
only fear was that Milady would recognize in him the man of Meung and of
Dover. Then she knew that he was one of the friends of M. de Treville,
and consequently, that he belonged body and soul to the king; which
would make him lose a part of his advantage, since when known to Milady
as he knew her, he played only an equal game with her. As to the
commencement of an intrigue between her and M. de Wardes, our
presumptuous hero gave but little heed to that, although the marquis was
young, handsome, rich, and high in the cardinalâ€™s favor. It is not for
nothing we are but twenty years old, above all if we were born at
Tarbes.
Dâ€™Artagnan began by making his most splendid toilet, then returned to
Athosâ€™s, and according to custom, related everything to him. Athos
listened to his projects, then shook his head, and recommended prudence
to him with a shade of bitterness.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan felt the truth of this reproach.
â€œI loved Madame Bonacieux with my heart, while I only love Milady with

â€œThe part she plays, PARDIEU! It is not difficult to divine that, after
all you have told me. She is some emissary of the cardinal; a woman who

NA
Lord de Winter arrived at the appointed time; but Athos, being warned of
his coming, went into the other chamber. He therefore found dâ€™Artagnan
alone, and as it was nearly eight oâ€™clock he took the young man with
him.
An elegant carriage waited below, and as it was drawn by two excellent
horses, they were soon at the Place Royale.
Milady Clarik received dâ€™Artagnan ceremoniously. Her hotel was
remarkably sumptuous, and while the most part of the English had quit,
or were about to quit, France on account of the war, Milady had just
been laying out much money upon her residence; which proved that the
general measure which drove the English from France did not affect her.
NA
young gentleman who has held my life in his hands, and who has not
abused his advantage, although we have been twice enemies, although it
was I who insulted him, and although I am an Englishman. Thank him,
NA
Milady frowned slightly; a scarcely visible cloud passed over her brow,
and so peculiar a smile appeared upon her lips that the young man, who
saw and observed this triple shade, almost shuddered at it.
The brother did not perceive this; he had turned round to play with
Miladyâ€™s favorite monkey, which had pulled him by the doublet.
NA
sweetness contrasted with the symptoms of ill-humor which dâ€™Artagnan had
NA
The Englishman then turned round and described the combat without
omitting a single detail. Milady listened with the greatest attention,
and yet it was easily to be perceived, whatever effort she made to
conceal her impressions, that this recital was not agreeable to her. The
blood rose to her head, and her little foot worked with impatience
beneath her robe.
Lord de Winter perceived nothing of this. When he had finished, he went
to a table upon which was a salver with Spanish wine and glasses. He
filled two glasses, and by a sign invited dâ€™Artagnan to drink.
Dâ€™Artagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an Englishman to refuse
to pledge him. He therefore drew near to the table and took the second
glass. He did not, however, lose sight of Milady, and in a mirror he
perceived the change that came over her face. Now that she believed
herself to be no longer observed, a sentiment resembling ferocity
animated her countenance. She bit her handkerchief with her beautiful
teeth.
That pretty little SOUBRETTE whom dâ€™Artagnan had already observed then
came in. She spoke some words to Lord de Winter in English, who
thereupon requested dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s permission to retire, excusing himself
on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away, and
charging his sister to obtain his pardon.
Dâ€™Artagnan exchanged a shake of the hand with Lord de Winter, and then
returned to Milady. Her countenance, with surprising mobility, had
recovered its gracious expression; but some little red spots on her
handkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood came.
Those lips were magnificent; they might be said to be of coral.
The conversation took a cheerful turn. Milady appeared to have entirely
recovered. She told dâ€™Artagnan that Lord de Winter was her
brother-in-law, and not her brother. She had married a younger brother
of the family, who had left her a widow with one child. This child was
the only heir to Lord de Winter, if Lord de Winter did not marry. All
this showed dâ€™Artagnan that there was a veil which concealed something;
but he could not yet see under this veil.
In addition to this, after a half hourâ€™s conversation dâ€™Artagnan was
convinced that Milady was his compatriot; she spoke French with an
elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head.
Dâ€™Artagnan was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of
devotion. To all the simple things which escaped our Gascon, Milady
replied with a smile of kindness. The hour came for him to retire.
Dâ€™Artagnan took leave of Milady, and left the saloon the happiest of
men.
On the staircase he met the pretty SOUBRETTE, who brushed gently against
him as she passed, and then, blushing to the eyes, asked his pardon for
having touched him in a voice so sweet that the pardon was granted
instantly.
Dâ€™Artagnan came again on the morrow, and was still better received than
on the evening before. Lord de Winter was not at home; and it was Milady
who this time did all the honors of the evening. She appeared to take a
great interest in him, asked him whence he came, who were his friends,
and whether he had not sometimes thought of attaching himself to the
cardinal.
Dâ€™Artagnan, who, as we have said, was exceedingly prudent for a young
man of twenty, then remembered his suspicions regarding Milady. He
launched into a eulogy of his Eminence, and said that he should not have
failed to enter into the Guards of the cardinal instead of the kingâ€™s
Guards if he had happened to know M. de Cavois instead of M. de
Treville.
Milady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation,
and asked dâ€™Artagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had ever
been in England.
Dâ€™Artagnan replied that he had been sent thither by M. de Treville to
treat for a supply of horses, and that he had brought back four as
specimens.
Milady in the course of the conversation twice or thrice bit her lips;
she had to deal with a Gascon who played close.
At the same hour as on the preceding evening, dâ€™Artagnan retired. In the
corridor he again met the pretty Kitty; that was the name of the
SOUBRETTE. She looked at him with an expression of kindness which it was
impossible to mistake; but dâ€™Artagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress
that he noticed absolutely nothing but her.
Dâ€™Artagnan came again on the morrow and the day after that, and each day
Milady gave him a more gracious reception.
Every evening, either in the antechamber, the corridor, or on the
stairs, he met the pretty SOUBRETTE. But, as we have said, dâ€™Artagnan
paid no attention to this persistence of poor Kitty.
32 A PROCURATORâ€™S DINNER
However brilliant had been the part played by Porthos in the duel, it
had not made him forget the dinner of the procuratorâ€™s wife.
On the morrow he received the last touches of Mousquetonâ€™s brush for an
hour, and took his way toward the Rue aux Ours with the steps of a man
who was doubly in favor with fortune.
His heart beat, but not like dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s with a young and impatient
love. No; a more material interest stirred his blood. He was about at
last to pass that mysterious threshold, to climb those unknown stairs by
which, one by one, the old crowns of M. Coquenard had ascended. He was
about to see in reality a certain coffer of which he had twenty times
beheld the image in his dreams--a coffer long and deep, locked, bolted,
fastened in the wall; a coffer of which he had so often heard, and which
the hands--a little wrinkled, it is true, but still not without
elegance--of the procuratorâ€™s wife were about to open to his admiring
looks.
And then he--a wanderer on the earth, a man without fortune, a man
without family, a soldier accustomed to inns, cabarets, taverns, and
restaurants, a lover of wine forced to depend upon chance treats--was
about to partake of family meals, to enjoy the pleasures of a
comfortable establishment, and to give himself up to those little
NA
soldiers say.
To come in the capacity of a cousin, and seat himself every day at a
good table; to smooth the yellow, wrinkled brow of the old procurator;
to pluck the clerks a little by teaching them BASSETTE, PASSE-DIX, and
LANSQUENET, in their utmost nicety, and winning from them, by way of fee
for the lesson he would give them in an hour, their savings of a
month--all this was enormously delightful to Porthos.
The Musketeer could not forget the evil reports which then prevailed,
and which indeed have survived them, of the procurators of the
period--meanness, stinginess, fasts; but as, after all, excepting some
few acts of economy which Porthos had always found very unseasonable,
the procuratorâ€™s wife had been tolerably liberal--that is, be it
understood, for a procuratorâ€™s wife--he hoped to see a household of a
highly comfortable kind.
And yet, at the very door the Musketeer began to entertain some doubts.
The approach was not such as to prepossess people--an ill-smelling, dark
passage, a staircase half-lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer
from a neighboring yard; on the first floor a low door studded with
enormous nails, like the principal gate of the Grand Chatelet.
Porthos knocked with his hand. A tall, pale clerk, his face shaded by a
forest of virgin hair, opened the door, and bowed with the air of a man
forced at once to respect in another lofty stature, which indicated
strength, the military dress, which indicated rank, and a ruddy
countenance, which indicated familiarity with good living.
A shorter clerk came behind the first, a taller clerk behind the second,
a stripling of a dozen years rising behind the third. In all, three
clerks and a half, which, for the time, argued a very extensive
clientage.
Although the Musketeer was not expected before one oâ€™clock, the
procuratorâ€™s wife had been on the watch ever since midday, reckoning
that the heart, or perhaps the stomach, of her lover would bring him
before his time.
Mme. Coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same
moment her guest entered from the stairs, and the appearance of the
worthy lady relieved him from an awkward embarrassment. The clerks
surveyed him with great curiosity, and he, not knowing well what to say
to this ascending and descending scale, remained tongue-tied.
NA
NA
The name of Porthos produced its effect upon the clerks, who began to
laugh; but Porthos turned sharply round, and every countenance quickly
recovered its gravity.
They reached the office of the procurator after having passed through
the antechamber in which the clerks were, and the study in which they
ought to have been. This last apartment was a sort of dark room,
littered with papers. On quitting the study they left the kitchen on the
right, and entered the reception room.
All these rooms, which communicated with one another, did not inspire
Porthos favorably. Words might be heard at a distance through all these
open doors. Then, while passing, he had cast a rapid, investigating
glance into the kitchen; and he was obliged to confess to himself, to
the shame of the procuratorâ€™s wife and his own regret, that he did not
see that fire, that animation, that bustle, which when a good repast is
on foot prevails generally in that sanctuary of good living.
The procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit, as he
expressed no surprise at the sight of Porthos, who advanced toward him
with a sufficiently easy air, and saluted him courteously.
NA
rising, yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane chair.
The old man, wrapped in a large black doublet, in which the whole of his
slender body was concealed, was brisk and dry. His little gray eyes
shone like carbuncles, and appeared, with his grinning mouth, to be the
only part of his face in which life survived. Unfortunately the legs
began to refuse their service to this bony machine. During the last five
or six months that this weakness had been felt, the worthy procurator
had nearly become the slave of his wife.
The cousin was received with resignation, that was all. M. Coquenard,
firm upon his legs, would have declined all relationship with M.
Porthos.
NA
disconcerted, as he had never reckoned upon being received
enthusiastically by the husband.
NA
Porthos did not feel the ridicule of this, and took it for a piece of
simplicity, at which he laughed in his large mustache. Mme. Coquenard,
who knew that a simple-minded procurator was a very rare variety in the
species, smiled a little, and colored a great deal.
M Coquenard had, since the arrival of Porthos, frequently cast his eyes
with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his oak
desk. Porthos comprehended that this chest, although it did not
correspond in shape with that which he had seen in his dreams, must be
the blessed coffer, and he congratulated himself that the reality was
several feet higher than the dream.
M Coquenard did not carry his genealogical investigations any further;
but withdrawing his anxious look from the chest and fixing it upon
Porthos, he contented himself with saying, â€œMonsieur our cousin will do
us the favor of dining with us once before his departure for the

This time Porthos received the blow right in his stomach, and felt it.
It appeared likewise that Mme. Coquenard was not less affected by it on
her part, for she added, â€œMy cousin will not return if he finds that we
do not treat him kindly; but otherwise he has so little time to pass in
Paris, and consequently to spare to us, that we must entreat him to give

NA
tried to smile.
This succor, which came to Porthos at the moment in which he was
attacked in his gastronomic hopes, inspired much gratitude in the
Musketeer toward the procuratorâ€™s wife.
The hour of dinner soon arrived. They passed into the eating room--a
large dark room situated opposite the kitchen.
The clerks, who, as it appeared, had smelled unusual perfumes in the
house, were of military punctuality, and held their stools in hand quite
ready to sit down. Their jaws moved preliminarily with fearful
threatenings.
NA
clerks--for the errand boy, as might be expected, was not admitted to
the honors of the magisterial table, â€œin my cousinâ€™s place, I would not
keep such gourmands! They look like shipwrecked sailors who have not

M Coquenard entered, pushed along upon his armchair with casters by Mme.
Coquenard, whom Porthos assisted in rolling her husband up to the table.
He had scarcely entered when he began to agitate his nose and his jaws
after the example of his clerks.
NA
NA
Porthos, at the sight of a pale liquid, abundant but entirely free from
meat, on the surface of which a few crusts swam about as rare as the
islands of an archipelago.
Mme. Coquenard smiled, and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took
his seat.
M Coquenard was served first, then Porthos. Afterward Mme. Coquenard
filled her own plate, and distributed the crusts without soup to the
impatient clerks. At this moment the door of the dining room unclosed
with a creak, and Porthos perceived through the half-open flap the
little clerk who, not being allowed to take part in the feast, ate his
dry bread in the passage with the double odor of the dining room and
kitchen.
After the soup the maid brought a boiled fowl--a piece of magnificence
which caused the eyes of the diners to dilate in such a manner that they
seemed ready to burst.
NA
procurator, with a smile that was almost tragic. â€œYou are certainly
NA
The poor fowl was thin, and covered with one of those thick, bristly
skins through which the teeth cannot penetrate with all their efforts.
The fowl must have been sought for a long time on the perch, to which it
had retired to die of old age.
NA
NA
And he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion; but on the
contrary, he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring, in
anticipation, that sublime fowl which was the object of his contempt.
Mme. Coquenard drew the dish toward her, skillfully detached the two
great black feet, which she placed upon her husbandâ€™s plate, cut off the
neck, which with the head she put on one side for herself, raised the
wing for Porthos, and then returned the bird otherwise intact to the
servant who had brought it in, who disappeared with it before the
Musketeer had time to examine the variations which disappointment
produces upon faces, according to the characters and temperaments of
those who experience it.
In the place of the fowl a dish of haricot beans made its appearance--an
enormous dish in which some bones of mutton that at first sight one
might have believed to have some meat on them pretended to show
themselves.
But the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit, and their lugubrious
looks settled down into resigned countenances.
Mme. Coquenard distributed this dish to the young men with the
moderation of a good housewife.
The time for wine came. M. Coquenard poured from a very small stone
bottle the third of a glass for each of the young men, served himself in
about the same proportion, and passed the bottle to Porthos and Mme.
Coquenard.
The young men filled up their third of a glass with water; then, when
they had drunk half the glass, they filled it up again, and continued to
do so. This brought them, by the end of the repast, to swallowing a
drink which from the color of the ruby had passed to that of a pale
topaz.
Porthos ate his wing of the fowl timidly, and shuddered when he felt the
knee of the procuratorâ€™s wife under the table, as it came in search of
his. He also drank half a glass of this sparingly served wine, and found
it to be nothing but that horrible Montreuil--the terror of all expert
palates.
M Coquenard saw him swallowing this wine undiluted, and sighed deeply.
NA
NA
NA
NA
There was silence. Porthos could hardly keep his countenance.
The procurator repeated several times, â€œAh, Madame Coquenard! Accept my
NA
M Coquenard had eaten his soup, the black feet of the fowl, and the only
mutton bone on which there was the least appearance of meat.
Porthos fancied they were mystifying him, and began to curl his mustache
and knit his eyebrows; but the knee of Mme. Coquenard gently advised him
to be patient.
This silence and this interruption in serving, which were unintelligible
to Porthos, had, on the contrary, a terrible meaning for the clerks.
Upon a look from the procurator, accompanied by a smile from Mme.
Coquenard, they arose slowly from the table, folded their napkins more
slowly still, bowed, and retired.
NA
procurator, gravely.
The clerks gone, Mme. Coquenard rose and took from a buffet a piece of
cheese, some preserved quinces, and a cake which she had herself made of
almonds and honey.
M Coquenard knit his eyebrows because there were too many good things.
Porthos bit his lips because he saw not the wherewithal to dine. He
looked to see if the dish of beans was still there; the dish of beans
had disappeared.
NA
NA
Porthos looked at the bottle, which was near him, and hoped that with
wine, bread, and cheese, he might make a dinner; but wine was wanting,
the bottle was empty. M. and Mme. Coquenard did not seem to observe it.
NA
He passed his tongue over a spoonful of preserves, and stuck his teeth
into the sticky pastry of Mme. Coquenard.
NA
NA
M Coquenard, after the luxuries of such a repast, which he called an
excess, felt the want of a siesta. Porthos began to hope that the thing
would take place at the present sitting, and in that same locality; but
the procurator would listen to nothing, he would be taken to his room,
and was not satisfied till he was close to his chest, upon the edge of
which, for still greater precaution, he placed his feet.
The procuratorâ€™s wife took Porthos into an adjoining room, and they
began to lay the basis of a reconciliation.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œBut of what, then, does the equipment of your company consist, Monsieur
NA
NA
picked soldiers, and they require many things useless to the Guardsmen
NA
NA
â€œWhy, they may amount to--â€œ, said Porthos, who preferred discussing the
total to taking them one by one.
The procuratorâ€™s wife waited tremblingly.
NA
speech failed her.
NA
livres! I even think that with economy I could manage it with two

NA
Porthos made a most significant grimace; Mme. Coquenard understood it.
NA
in business, I was almost sure of obtaining things at a hundred per cent
NA
NA
â€œYes, dear Monsieur Porthos. Thus, for instance, donâ€™t you in the first
NA
NA
NA
NA
must have the appointments complete, as they include objects which a
Musketeer alone can purchase, and which will not amount, besides, to
NA
NA
procuratorâ€™s wife, with a sigh.
Porthos smiled. It may be remembered that he had the saddle which came
from Buckingham. These three hundred livres he reckoned upon putting
snugly into his pocket.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo; I only thought that a pretty mule makes sometimes as good an
appearance as a horse, and it seemed to me that by getting a pretty mule

But then you understand, Madame Coquenard, a mule with feathers and
NA
NA
NA
NA
five or six valises; you shall choose the best. There is one in
particular which he prefers in his journeys, large enough to hold all
NA
NA
NA
innocence.
NA
NA
Madame uttered fresh sighs. Moliere had not written his scene in
NA
Finally, the rest of the equipment was successively debated in the same
manner; and the result of the sitting was that the procuratorâ€™s wife
should give eight hundred livres in money, and should furnish the horse
and the mule which should have the honor of carrying Porthos and
Mousqueton to glory.
These conditions being agreed to, Porthos took leave of Mme. Coquenard.
The latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances; but
Porthos urged the commands of duty, and the procuratorâ€™s wife was
obliged to give place to the king.
The Musketeer returned home hungry and in bad humor.
33 SOUBRETTE AND MISTRESS
Meantime, as we have said, despite the cries of his conscience and the
wise counsels of Athos, dâ€™Artagnan became hourly more in love with
Milady. Thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her; and the
self-satisfied Gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not
fail to respond.
One day, when he arrived with his head in the air, and as light at heart
as a man who awaits a shower of gold, he found the SOUBRETTE under the
gateway of the hotel; but this time the pretty Kitty was not contented
with touching him as he passed, she took him gently by the hand.
NA
from her mistress; she is about to appoint some rendezvous of which she

the most triumphant air imaginable.
NA
SOUBRETTE.
NA
â€œHere? Impossible! That which I have to say is too long, and above all,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
And Kitty, who had not let go the hand of dâ€™Artagnan, led him up a
little dark, winding staircase, and after ascending about fifteen steps,
opened a door.
NA
NA
NA
â€œIt is mine, Monsieur Chevalier; it communicates with my mistressâ€™s by
that door. But you need not fear. She will not hear what we say; she
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan cast a glance around him. The little apartment was charming
for its taste and neatness; but in spite of himself, his eyes were
directed to that door which Kitty said led to Miladyâ€™s chamber.
Kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man, and heaved
a deep sigh.
NA
NA
Kitty breathed a second sigh.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œOh, no, monsieur; but out of the regard I have for you, I have taken
NA
â€œMuch obliged, my dear Kitty; but for the intention only--for the

NA
â€œWe have always some difficulty in believing such things, my pretty
NA
NA
â€œI confess that unless you deign to give me some proof of what you
NA
NA
Kitty drew a little note from her bosom.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The remembrance of the scene at St. Germain presented itself to the mind
of the presumptuous Gascon. As quick as thought, he tore open the
letter, in spite of the cry which Kitty uttered on seeing what he was
going to do, or rather, what he was doing.
NA
NA
â€œYou have not answered my first note. Are you indisposed, or have you
forgotten the glances you favored me with at the ball of Mme. de Guise?
NA
dâ€™Artagnan became very pale; he was wounded in his SELF-love: he thought
that it was in his LOVE.
NA
compassion, and pressing anew the young manâ€™s hand.
NA
NA
NA
the first time with much attention.
NA
â€œWell, then, instead of pitying me, you would do much better to assist

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI? In what can I have offended her--I who ever since I have known her
NA
â€œI will never confess that but to the man--who should read to the bottom
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan looked at Kitty for the second time. The young girl had
freshness and beauty which many duchesses would have purchased with
their coronets.
NA
NA
poor girl became as red as a cherry.
NA
NA
NA
NA
by the kiss in the first place, and still further by the expression of
NA
Then only dâ€™Artagnan remembered the languishing glances of Kitty, her
constantly meeting him in the antechamber, the corridor, or on the
stairs, those touches of the hand every time she met him, and her deep
sighs; but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady, he had
disdained the soubrette. He whose game is the eagle takes no heed of the
sparrow.
But this time our Gascon saw at a glance all the advantage to be derived
from the love which Kitty had just confessed so innocently, or so
boldly: the interception of letters addressed to the Comte de Wardes,
news on the spot, entrance at all hours into Kittyâ€™s chamber, which was
contiguous to her mistressâ€™s. The perfidious deceiver was, as may
plainly be perceived, already sacrificing, in intention, the poor girl
in order to obtain Milady, willy-nilly.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAre you willing that I should this evening pass with you the time I
NA
NA
NA
in an easy chair; â€œcome, and let me tell you that you are the prettiest
NA
And he did tell her so much, and so well, that the poor girl, who asked
nothing better than to believe him, did believe him. Nevertheless, to
dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s great astonishment, the pretty Kitty defended herself
resolutely.
Time passes quickly when it is passed in attacks and defenses. Midnight
sounded, and almost at the same time the bell was rung in Miladyâ€™s
chamber.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan rose, took his hat, as if it had been his intention to obey,
then, opening quickly the door of a large closet instead of that leading
to the staircase, he buried himself amid the robes and dressing gowns of
Milady.
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan, who had secured the key, shut himself up in the closet
without reply.
NA
NA
And dâ€™Artagnan heard the door of communication opened violently.
NA
her mistress.
Both went into the bedroom, and as the door of communication remained
open, dâ€™Artagnan could hear Milady for some time scolding her maid. She
was at length appeased, and the conversation turned upon him while Kitty
was assisting her mistress.
NA
NA
NA
â€œOh, no; he must have been prevented by Monsieur de Treville or Monsieur
NA
NA
â€œWhat will I do with him? Be easy, Kitty, there is something between
that man and me that he is quite ignorant of: he nearly made me lose my

NA
â€œI love him? I detest him! An idiot, who held the life of Lord de Winter
in his hands and did not kill him, by which I missed three hundred
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan shuddered to the marrow at hearing this suave creature
reproach him, with that sharp voice which she took such pains to conceal
in conversation, for not having killed a man whom he had seen load her
with kindnesses.
NA
myself on him if, and I donâ€™t know why, the cardinal had not requested
NA
â€œOh, yes; but Madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so
NA
â€œWhat, the mercerâ€™s wife of the Rue des Fossoyeurs? Has he not already
NA
A cold sweat broke from dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s brow. Why, this woman was a
monster! He resumed his listening, but unfortunately the toilet was
finished.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan heard the door close; then the noise of two bolts by which
Milady fastened herself in. On her side, but as softly as possible,
Kitty turned the key of the lock, and then dâ€™Artagnan opened the closet
door.
NA
NA
NA
NA
between my chamber and Miladyâ€™s; every word that is uttered in one can
NA
NA
NA
NA
He drew Kitty to him. She had the less motive to resist, resistance
would make so much noise. Therefore Kitty surrendered.
It was a movement of vengeance upon Milady. Dâ€™Artagnan believed it right
to say that vengeance is the pleasure of the gods. With a little more
heart, he might have been contented with this new conquest; but the
principal features of his character were ambition and pride. It must,
however, be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of
his influence over Kitty was to try and find out what had become of Mme.
Bonacieux; but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to dâ€™Artagnan that
she was entirely ignorant on that head, her mistress never admitting her
into half her secrets--only she believed she could say she was not dead.
As to the cause which was near making Milady lose her credit with the
cardinal, Kitty knew nothing about it; but this time dâ€™Artagnan was
better informed than she was. As he had seen Milady on board a vessel at
the moment he was leaving England, he suspected that it was, almost
without a doubt, on account of the diamond studs.
But what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred, the profound
hatred, the inveterate hatred of Milady, was increased by his not having
killed her brother-in-law.
Dâ€™Artagnan came the next day to Miladyâ€™s, and finding her in a very
ill-humor, had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from M. de Wardes
that provoked her thus. Kitty came in, but Milady was very cross with
her. The poor girl ventured a glance at dâ€™Artagnan which said, â€œSee how
NA
Toward the end of the evening, however, the beautiful lioness became
milder; she smilingly listened to the soft speeches of dâ€™Artagnan, and
even gave him her hand to kiss.
Dâ€™Artagnan departed, scarcely knowing what to think, but as he was a
youth who did not easily lose his head, while continuing to pay his
court to Milady, he had framed a little plan in his mind.
He found Kitty at the gate, and, as on the preceding evening, went up to
her chamber. Kitty had been accused of negligence and severely scolded.
Milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the Comte de Wardes,
and she ordered Kitty to come at nine oâ€™clock in the morning to take a
third letter.
Dâ€™Artagnan made Kitty promise to bring him that letter on the following
morning. The poor girl promised all her lover desired; she was mad.
Things passed as on the night before. Dâ€™Artagnan concealed himself in
his closet; Milady called, undressed, sent away Kitty, and shut the
door. As the night before, dâ€™Artagnan did not return home till five
oâ€™clock in the morning.
At eleven oâ€™clock Kitty came to him. She held in her hand a fresh billet
from Milady. This time the poor girl did not even argue with dâ€™Artagnan;
she gave it to him at once. She belonged body and soul to her handsome
soldier.
Dâ€™Artagnan opened the letter and read as follows:
This is the third time I have written to you to tell you that I love
you. Beware that I do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that I
detest you.
If you repent of the manner in which you have acted toward me, the young
girl who brings you this will tell you how a man of spirit may obtain
his pardon.
dâ€™Artagnan colored and grew pale several times in reading this billet.
NA
young manâ€™s countenance for an instant.
â€œNo, Kitty, you are mistaken. I do not love her, but I will avenge
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan took a pen and wrote:
Madame, Until the present moment I could not believe that it was to me
your first two letters were addressed, so unworthy did I feel myself of
such an honor; besides, I was so seriously indisposed that I could not
in any case have replied to them.
But now I am forced to believe in the excess of your kindness, since not
only your letter but your servant assures me that I have the good
fortune to be beloved by you.
She has no occasion to teach me the way in which a man of spirit may
obtain his pardon. I will come and ask mine at eleven oâ€™clock this
evening.
To delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh
offense.
From him whom you have rendered the happiest of men, Comte de Wardes
This note was in the first place a forgery; it was likewise an
indelicacy. It was even, according to our present manners, something
like an infamous action; but at that period people did not manage
affairs as they do today. Besides, dâ€™Artagnan from her own admission
knew Milady culpable of treachery in matters more important, and could
entertain no respect for her. And yet, notwithstanding this want of
respect, he felt an uncontrollable passion for this woman boiling in his
veins--passion drunk with contempt; but passion or thirst, as the reader
pleases.
Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s plan was very simple. By Kittyâ€™s chamber he could gain that
of her mistress. He would take advantage of the first moment of
surprise, shame, and terror, to triumph over her. He might fail, but
something must be left to chance. In eight days the campaign would open,
and he would be compelled to leave Paris; dâ€™Artagnan had no time for a
prolonged love siege.
NA
NA
Poor Kitty became as pale as death; she suspected what the letter
contained.
NA
all this must end, some way or other. Milady may discover that you gave
the first billet to my lackey instead of to the countâ€™s; that it is I
who have opened the others which ought to have been opened by de Wardes.
Milady will then turn you out of doors, and you know she is not the
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA

NA
To this reproach there is always one response which deludes women.
Dâ€™Artagnan replied in such a manner that Kitty remained in her great
delusion. Although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the
letter to her mistress, she did at last so decide, which was all
dâ€™Artagnan wished. Finally he promised that he would leave her
mistressâ€™s presence at an early hour that evening, and that when he left
the mistress he would ascend with the maid. This promise completed poor
Kittyâ€™s consolation.
34 IN WHICH THE EQUIPMENT OF ARAMIS AND PORTHOS IS TREATED OF
Since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments, there
had been no fixed meeting between them. They dined apart from one
another, wherever they might happen to be, or rather where they could.
Duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which was
gliding away so rapidly--only they had agreed to meet once a week, about
one oâ€™clock, at the residence of Athos, seeing that he, in agreement
with the vow he had formed, did not pass over the threshold of his door.
This day of reunion was the same day as that on which Kitty came to find
dâ€™Artagnan. Soon as Kitty left him, dâ€™Artagnan directed his steps toward
the Rue Ferou.
He found Athos and Aramis philosophizing. Aramis had some slight
inclination to resume the cassock. Athos, according to his system,
neither encouraged nor dissuaded him. Athos believed that everyone
should be left to his own free will. He never gave advice but when it
was asked, and even then he required to be asked twice.
NA
they do follow it, it is for the sake of having someone to blame for
NA
Porthos arrived a minute after dâ€™Artagnan. The four friends were
reunited.
The four countenances expressed four different feelings: that of
Porthos, tranquillity; that of dâ€™Artagnan, hope; that of Aramis,
uneasiness; that of Athos, carelessness.
At the end of a momentâ€™s conversation, in which Porthos hinted that a
lady of elevated rank had condescended to relieve him from his
embarrassment, Mousqueton entered. He came to request his master to
return to his lodgings, where his presence was urgent, as he piteously
said.

Porthos rose, saluted his friends, and followed Mousqueton. An instant
after, Bazin made his appearance at the door.

â€œI believe these fellows have managed their business. What do you think,

account. But you, my dear Athos--you, who so generously distributed the
Englishmanâ€™s pistoles, which were our legitimate property--what do you

NA
NA
NA
â€œNot at all. I have acquired certain knowledge that that woman was

â€œYes, I understand now: to find one woman, you court another. It is the

Dâ€™Artagnan was on the point of telling Athos all; but one consideration
restrained him. Athos was a gentleman, punctilious in points of honor;
and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for Milady, he
was sure, certain things that would not obtain the assent of this
Puritan. He was therefore silent; and as Athos was the least inquisitive
of any man on earth, dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s confidence stopped there. We will
therefore leave the two friends, who had nothing important to say to
each other, and follow Aramis.
Upon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came from
Tours, we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed, or rather
went before, Bazin; he ran without stopping from the Rue Ferou to the
Rue de Vaugirard. On entering he found a man of short stature and
intelligent eyes, but covered with rags.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
opening a little ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl, â€œhere it is.
NA
NA
In fact, Bazin, curious to know what the mendicant could want with his
master, kept pace with him as well as he could, and arrived almost at
the same time he did; but his quickness was not of much use to him. At
the hint from the mendicant his master made him a sign to retire, and he
was obliged to obey.
Bazin gone, the mendicant cast a rapid glance around him in order to be
sure that nobody could either see or hear him, and opening his ragged
vest, badly held together by a leather strap, he began to rip the upper
part of his doublet, from which he drew a letter.
Aramis uttered a cry of joy at the sight of the seal, kissed the
superscription with an almost religious respect, and opened the epistle,
which contained what follows:
â€œMy Friend, it is the will of fate that we should be still for some time
separated; but the delightful days of youth are not lost beyond return.
Perform your duty in camp; I will do mine elsewhere. Accept that which
the bearer brings you; make the campaign like a handsome true gentleman,
and think of me, who kisses tenderly your black eyes.
NA
The mendicant continued to rip his garments; and drew from amid his rags
a hundred and fifty Spanish double pistoles, which he laid down on the
table; then he opened the door, bowed, and went out before the young
man, stupefied by his letter, had ventured to address a word to him.
Aramis then reperused the letter, and perceived a postscript:
PS. You may behave politely to the bearer, who is a count and a grandee
of Spain!
NA
yes, we shall yet have happy days! My love, my blood, my life! all, all,
NA
And he kissed the letter with passion, without even vouchsafing a look
at the gold which sparkled on the table.
Bazin scratched at the door, and as Aramis had no longer any reason to
exclude him, he bade him come in.
Bazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold, and forgot that he came to
announce dâ€™Artagnan, who, curious to know who the mendicant could be,
came to Aramis on leaving Athos.
Now, as dâ€™Artagnan used no ceremony with Aramis, seeing that Bazin
forgot to announce him, he announced himself.
NA

that. A poet is as good as an abbe. Ah! Monsieur Aramis, become a poet,

Bazin perceived he was wrong; he bowed and went out.

will lose that letter which is peeping from your doublet, and which also

Aramis blushed to the eyes, crammed in the letter, and re-buttoned his
doublet.
NA
as I am rich, we will today begin to dine together again, expecting that
NA
NA
have had a good dinner; and I, for my part, have a somewhat hazardous
expedition for this evening, and shall not be sorry, I confess, to
NA
NA
Aramis, from whom the letter and the gold had removed, as by magic, his
ideas of conversion.
And having put three or four double pistoles into his pocket to answer
the needs of the moment, he placed the others in the ebony box, inlaid
with mother of pearl, in which was the famous handkerchief which served
him as a talisman.
The two friends repaired to Athosâ€™s, and he, faithful to his vow of not
going out, took upon him to order dinner to be brought to them. As he
was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy, dâ€™Artagnan and
Aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to him.
They went to find Porthos, and at the corner of the Rue Bac met
Mousqueton, who, with a most pitiable air, was driving before him a mule
and a horse.
Dâ€™Artagnan uttered a cry of surprise, which was not quite free from joy.

carcass is not worth eighteen livres. But how did this horse come into

NA
NA
NA
â€œWhy, we are looked upon with a rather favorable eye by a lady of
quality, the Duchesse de--but, your pardon; my master has commanded me
to be discreet. She had forced us to accept a little souvenir, a
magnificent Spanish GENET and an Andalusian mule, which were beautiful
to look upon. The husband heard of the affair; on their way he

â€œNo, PARDIEU; though I should like to have seen Porthos on my yellow
horse. That would give me an idea of how I looked when I arrived in

NA
He continued his way toward the Quai des Grands Augustins, while the two
friends went to ring at the bell of the unfortunate Porthos. He, having
seen them crossing the yard, took care not to answer, and they rang in
vain.
Meanwhile Mousqueton continued on his way, and crossing the Pont Neuf,
still driving the two sorry animals before him, he reached the Rue aux
Ours. Arrived there, he fastened, according to the orders of his master,
both horse and mule to the knocker of the procuratorâ€™s door; then,
without taking any thought for their future, he returned to Porthos, and
told him that his commission was completed.
In a short time the two unfortunate beasts, who had not eaten anything
since the morning, made such a noise in raising and letting fall the
knocker that the procurator ordered his errand boy to go and inquire in
the neighborhood to whom this horse and mule belonged.
Mme. Coquenard recognized her present, and could not at first comprehend
this restitution; but the visit of Porthos soon enlightened her. The
anger which fired the eyes of the Musketeer, in spite of his efforts to
suppress it, terrified his sensitive inamorata. In fact, Mousqueton had
not concealed from his master that he had met dâ€™Artagnan and Aramis, and
that dâ€™Artagnan in the yellow horse had recognized the Bearnese pony
upon which he had come to Paris, and which he had sold for three crowns.
Porthos went away after having appointed a meeting with the procuratorâ€™s
wife in the cloister of St. Magloire. The procurator, seeing he was
going, invited him to dinner--an invitation which the Musketeer refused
with a majestic air.
Mme. Coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of St. Magloire, for
she guessed the reproaches that awaited her there; but she was
fascinated by the lofty airs of Porthos.
All that which a man wounded in his self-love could let fall in the
shape of imprecations and reproaches upon the head of a woman Porthos
let fall upon the bowed head of the procuratorâ€™s wife.

Porthos, without reply, retreated a second step. The procuratorâ€™s wife
fancied she saw him in a brilliant cloud, all surrounded by duchesses
and marchionesses, who cast bags of money at his feet.

35 A GASCON A MATCH FOR CUPID
The evening so impatiently waited for by Porthos and by dâ€™Artagnan at
last arrived.
As was his custom, dâ€™Artagnan presented himself at Miladyâ€™s at about
nine oâ€™clock. He found her in a charming humor. Never had he been so
well received. Our Gascon knew, by the first glance of his eye, that his
billet had been delivered, and that this billet had had its effect.
Kitty entered to bring some sherbet. Her mistress put on a charming
face, and smiled on her graciously; but alas! the poor girl was so sad
that she did not even notice Miladyâ€™s condescension.
Dâ€™Artagnan looked at the two women, one after the other, and was forced
to acknowledge that in his opinion Dame Nature had made a mistake in
their formation. To the great lady she had given a heart vile and venal;
to the SOUBRETTE she had given the heart of a duchess.
At ten oâ€™clock Milady began to appear restless. Dâ€™Artagnan knew what she
wanted. She looked at the clock, rose, reseated herself, smiled at
dâ€™Artagnan with an air which said, â€œYou are very amiable, no doubt, but
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan rose and took his hat; Milady gave him her hand to kiss. The
young man felt her press his hand, and comprehended that this was a
sentiment, not of coquetry, but of gratitude because of his departure.
NA
This time Kitty was nowhere waiting for him; neither in the antechamber,
nor in the corridor, nor beneath the great door. It was necessary that
dâ€™Artagnan should find alone the staircase and the little chamber. She
heard him enter, but she did not raise her head. The young man went to
her and took her hands; then she sobbed aloud.
As dâ€™Artagnan had presumed, on receiving his letter, Milady in a
delirium of joy had told her servant everything; and by way of
recompense for the manner in which she had this time executed the
commission, she had given Kitty a purse.
Returning to her own room, Kitty had thrown the purse into a corner,
where it lay open, disgorging three or four gold pieces on the carpet.
The poor girl, under the caresses of dâ€™Artagnan, lifted her head.
Dâ€™Artagnan himself was frightened by the change in her countenance. She
joined her hands with a suppliant air, but without venturing to speak a
word. As little sensitive as was the heart of dâ€™Artagnan, he was touched
by this mute sorrow; but he held too tenaciously to his projects, above
all to this one, to change the program which he had laid out in advance.
He did not therefore allow her any hope that he would flinch; only he
represented his action as one of simple vengeance.
For the rest this vengeance was very easy; for Milady, doubtless to
conceal her blushes from her lover, had ordered Kitty to extinguish all
the lights in the apartment, and even in the little chamber itself.
Before daybreak M. de Wardes must take his departure, still in
obscurity.
Presently they heard Milady retire to her room. Dâ€™Artagnan slipped into
the wardrobe. Hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded.
Kitty went to her mistress, and did not leave the door open; but the
partition was so thin that one could hear nearly all that passed between
the two women.
Milady seemed overcome with joy, and made Kitty repeat the smallest
details of the pretended interview of the soubrette with de Wardes when
he received the letter; how he had responded; what was the expression of
his face; if he seemed very amorous. And to all these questions poor
Kitty, forced to put on a pleasant face, responded in a stifled voice
whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark, solely
because happiness is egotistical.
Finally, as the hour for her interview with the count approached, Milady
had everything about her darkened, and ordered Kitty to return to her
own chamber, and introduce de Wardes whenever he presented himself.
Kittyâ€™s detention was not long. Hardly had dâ€™Artagnan seen, through a
crevice in his closet, that the whole apartment was in obscurity, than
he slipped out of his concealment, at the very moment when Kitty
reclosed the door of communication.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
At this appeal dâ€™Artagnan drew Kitty quietly away, and slipped into the
chamber.
If rage or sorrow ever torture the heart, it is when a lover receives
under a name which is not his own protestations of love addressed to his
happy rival. Dâ€™Artagnan was in a dolorous situation which he had not
foreseen. Jealousy gnawed his heart; and he suffered almost as much as
poor Kitty, who at that very moment was crying in the next chamber.
NA
in her own, â€œI am happy in the love which your looks and your words have
expressed to me every time we have met. I also--I love you. Oh,
tomorrow, tomorrow, I must have some pledge from you which will prove
NA
she slipped a ring from her finger onto dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s. Dâ€™Artagnan
remembered having seen this ring on the finger of Milady; it was a
magnificent sapphire, encircled with brilliants.
The first movement of dâ€™Artagnan was to return it, but Milady added,
NA
added, in a voice full of emotion, â€œyou render me a much greater service
NA
NA
that instant he felt himself ready to reveal all. He even opened his
mouth to tell Milady who he was, and with what a revengeful purpose he
had come; but she added, â€œPoor angel, whom that monster of a Gascon
NA
The monster was himself.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
It took some time for dâ€™Artagnan to resume this little dialogue; but
then all the ideas of vengeance which he had brought with him had
completely vanished. This woman exercised over him an unaccountable
power; he hated and adored her at the same time. He would not have
believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart,
and by their union constitute a passion so strange, and as it were,
diabolical.
Presently it sounded one oâ€™clock. It was necessary to separate.
Dâ€™Artagnan at the moment of quitting Milady felt only the liveliest
regret at the parting; and as they addressed each other in a
reciprocally passionate adieu, another interview was arranged for the
following week.
Poor Kitty hoped to speak a few words to dâ€™Artagnan when he passed
through her chamber; but Milady herself reconducted him through the
darkness, and only quit him at the staircase.
The next morning dâ€™Artagnan ran to find Athos. He was engaged in an
adventure so singular that he wished for counsel. He therefore told him
all.
NA
less you have done wrong to deceive her. In one fashion or another you

While thus speaking Athos regarded with attention the sapphire set with
diamonds which had taken, on dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s finger, the place of the
queenâ€™s ring, carefully kept in a casket.

dâ€™Artagnan, taking it from his finger.
Athos examined it and became very pale. He tried it on his left hand; it
fit his finger as if made for it.
A shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of
this gentleman.

Dâ€™Artagnan became pensive in his turn; it appeared as if there were
abysses in Miladyâ€™s soul whose depths were dark and unknown. He took
back the ring, but put it in his pocket and not on his finger.

with his thoughts.
On reaching home dâ€™Artagnan found Kitty waiting for him. A month of
fever could not have changed her more than this one night of
sleeplessness and sorrow.
She was sent by her mistress to the false de Wardes. Her mistress was
mad with love, intoxicated with joy. She wished to know when her lover
would meet her a second night; and poor Kitty, pale and trembling,
awaited dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s reply. The counsels of his friend, joined to the
cries of his own heart, made him determine, now his pride was saved and
his vengeance satisfied, not to see Milady again. As a reply, he wrote
the following letter:
Do not depend upon me, madame, for the next meeting. Since my
convalescence I have so many affairs of this kind on my hands that I am
forced to regulate them a little. When your turn comes, I shall have the
honor to inform you of it. I kiss your hands.
Comte de Wardes
Not a word about the sapphire. Was the Gascon determined to keep it as a
weapon against Milady, or else, let us be frank, did he not reserve the
sapphire as a last resource for his outfit? It would be wrong to judge
the actions of one period from the point of view of another. That which
would now be considered as disgraceful to a gentleman was at that time
quite a simple and natural affair, and the younger sons of the best
families were frequently supported by their mistresses. Dâ€™Artagnan gave
the open letter to Kitty, who at first was unable to comprehend it, but
who became almost wild with joy on reading it a second time. She could
scarcely believe in her happiness; and dâ€™Artagnan was forced to renew
with the living voice the assurances which he had written. And whatever
might be--considering the violent character of Milady--the danger which
the poor girl incurred in giving this billet to her mistress, she ran
back to the Place Royale as fast as her legs could carry her.
The heart of the best woman is pitiless toward the sorrows of a rival.
Milady opened the letter with eagerness equal to Kittyâ€™s in bringing it;
but at the first words she read she became livid. She crushed the paper
in her hand, and turning with flashing eyes upon Kitty, she cried, â€œWhat
NA
NA
NA
NA

she was of the color of ashes. She tried to go toward the window for
air, but she could only stretch forth her arms; her legs failed her, and
she sank into an armchair. Kitty, fearing she was ill, hastened toward
her and was beginning to open her dress; but Milady started up, pushing

over her mistressâ€™s face.
â€œI faint? I? I? Do you take me for half a woman? When I am insulted I do

And she made a sign for Kitty to leave the room.
36 DREAM OF VENGEANCE
That evening Milady gave orders that when M. dâ€™Artagnan came as usual,
he should be immediately admitted; but he did not come.
The next day Kitty went to see the young man again, and related to him
all that had passed on the preceding evening. Dâ€™Artagnan smiled; this
jealous anger of Milady was his revenge.
That evening Milady was still more impatient than on the preceding
evening. She renewed the order relative to the Gascon; but as before she
expected him in vain.
The next morning, when Kitty presented herself at dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s, she was
no longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days; but on the
contrary sad as death.
Dâ€™Artagnan asked the poor girl what was the matter with her; but she, as
her only reply, drew a letter from her pocket and gave it to him.
This letter was in Miladyâ€™s handwriting; only this time it was addressed
to M. dâ€™Artagnan, and not to M. de Wardes.
He opened it and read as follows:
Dear M. dâ€™Artagnan, It is wrong thus to neglect your friends,
particularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a
time. My brother-in-law and myself expected you yesterday and the day
before, but in vain. Will it be the same this evening?
Your very grateful, Milady Clarik

NA
NA
NA
in his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made Athos; â€œyou must
understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive
invitation. Milady, not seeing me come again, would not be able to
understand what could cause the interruption of my visits, and might
suspect something; who could say how far the vengeance of such a woman

NA

court to her again, and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in your

Instinct made poor Kitty guess a part of what was to happen. Dâ€™Artagnan
reassured her as well as he could, and promised to remain insensible to
the seductions of Milady.
He desired Kitty to tell her mistress that he could not be more grateful
for her kindnesses than he was, and that he would be obedient to her
orders. He did not dare to write for fear of not being able--to such
experienced eyes as those of Milady--to disguise his writing
sufficiently.
As nine oâ€™clock sounded, dâ€™Artagnan was at the Place Royale. It was
evident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned, for
as soon as dâ€™Artagnan appeared, before even he had asked if Milady were
visible, one of them ran to announce him.
NA
dâ€™Artagnan heard her in the antechamber.
He was introduced.
NA
went out.
Dâ€™Artagnan cast an inquiring glance at Milady. She was pale, and looked
fatigued, either from tears or want of sleep. The number of lights had
been intentionally diminished, but the young woman could not conceal the
traces of the fever which had devoured her for two days.
Dâ€™Artagnan approached her with his usual gallantry. She then made an
extraordinary effort to receive him, but never did a more distressed
countenance give the lie to a more amiable smile.
To the questions which dâ€™Artagnan put concerning her health, she
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Milady assumed the most agreeable air possible, and conversed with more
than her usual brilliancy. At the same time the fever, which for an
instant abandoned her, returned to give luster to her eyes, color to her
cheeks, and vermillion to her lips. Dâ€™Artagnan was again in the presence
of the Circe who had before surrounded him with her enchantments. His
love, which he believed to be extinct but which was only asleep, awoke
again in his heart. Milady smiled, and dâ€™Artagnan felt that he could
damn himself for that smile. There was a moment at which he felt
something like remorse.
By degrees, Milady became more communicative. She asked dâ€™Artagnan if he
had a mistress.
NA
â€œcan you be cruel enough to put such a question to me--to me, who, from
the moment I saw you, have only breathed and sighed through you and for

Milady smiled with a strange smile.

Dâ€™Artagnan rapidly drew his seat nearer to Miladyâ€™s.

drawing her armchair nearer to dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s chair.
NA
Milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment; then, as if

Dâ€™Artagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature

She scarcely resisted.

and a threatening glance darted from her eyes.

Our Gascon promised this without risk, for he knew all that was meant.
NA
NA
NA
The warm pressure made dâ€™Artagnan tremble, as if by the touch that fever
which consumed Milady attacked himself.
NA
NA
And he folded her in his arms. She made no effort to remove her lips
from his kisses; only she did not respond to them. Her lips were cold;
it appeared to dâ€™Artagnan that he had embraced a statue.
He was not the less intoxicated with joy, electrified by love. He almost
believed in the tenderness of Milady; he almost believed in the crime of
de Wardes. If de Wardes had at that moment been under his hand, he would
have killed him.
Milady seized the occasion.
NA
NA
NA
endeavoring to read with her eyes to the bottom of his heart.
Dâ€™Artagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away, and that he
had committed an error.
NA
NA

â€œI know it because yesterday Monsieur de Wardes, in a saloon where I

NA

precipitation would not be very gracious toward dâ€™Artagnan.
Besides, she had a thousand precautions to take, a thousand counsels to
give to her defender, in order that he might avoid explanations with the
count before witnesses. All this was answered by an expression of

â€œBut it seems you had not much reason to complain of your fortune in

37 MILADYâ€™S SECRET
Dâ€™Artagnan left the hotel instead of going up at once to Kittyâ€™s
chamber, as she endeavored to persuade him to do--and that for two
reasons: the first, because by this means he should escape reproaches,
recriminations, and prayers; the second, because he was not sorry to
have an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring, if
possible, to fathom those of this woman.
What was most clear in the matter was that dâ€™Artagnan loved Milady like
a madman, and that she did not love him at all. In an instant dâ€™Artagnan
perceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home
and write Milady a long letter, in which he would confess to her that he
and de Wardes were, up to the present moment absolutely the same, and
that consequently he could not undertake, without committing suicide, to
kill the Comte de Wardes. But he also was spurred on by a ferocious
desire of vengeance. He wished to subdue this woman in his own name; and
as this vengeance appeared to him to have a certain sweetness in it, he
could not make up his mind to renounce it.
He walked six or seven times round the Place Royale, turning at every
ten steps to look at the light in Miladyâ€™s apartment, which was to be
seen through the blinds. It was evident that this time the young woman
was not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the
first.
At length the light disappeared. With this light was extinguished the
last irresolution in the heart of dâ€™Artagnan. He recalled to his mind
the details of the first night, and with a beating heart and a brain on
fire he re-entered the hotel and flew toward Kittyâ€™s chamber.
The poor girl, pale as death and trembling in all her limbs, wished to
delay her lover; but Milady, with her ear on the watch, had heard the
NA
All this was of such incredible immodesty, of such monstrous effrontery,
that dâ€™Artagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he heard. He
imagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic intrigues one
meets in dreams. He, however, darted not the less quickly toward Milady,
yielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone exercises over
iron.
As the door closed after them Kitty rushed toward it. Jealousy, fury,
offended pride, all the passions in short that dispute the heart of an
outraged woman in love, urged her to make a revelation; but she
reflected that she would be totally lost if she confessed having
assisted in such a machination, and above all, that dâ€™Artagnan would
also be lost to her forever. This last thought of love counseled her to
make this last sacrifice.
Dâ€™Artagnan, on his part, had gained the summit of all his wishes. It was
no longer a rival who was beloved; it was himself who was apparently
beloved. A secret voice whispered to him, at the bottom of his heart,
that he was but an instrument of vengeance, that he was only caressed
till he had given death; but pride, but self-love, but madness silenced
this voice and stifled its murmurs. And then our Gascon, with that large
quantity of conceit which we know he possessed, compared himself with de
Wardes, and asked himself why, after all, he should not be beloved for
himself?
He was absorbed entirely by the sensations of the moment. Milady was no
longer for him that woman of fatal intentions who had for a moment
terrified him; she was an ardent, passionate mistress, abandoning
herself to love which she also seemed to feel. Two hours thus glided
away. When the transports of the two lovers were calmer, Milady, who had
not the same motives for forgetfulness that dâ€™Artagnan had, was the
first to return to reality, and asked the young man if the means which
were on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and de Wardes
were already arranged in his mind.
But dâ€™Artagnan, whose ideas had taken quite another course, forgot
himself like a fool, and answered gallantly that it was too late to
think about duels and sword thrusts.
This coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified
Milady, whose questions became more pressing.
Then dâ€™Artagnan, who had never seriously thought of this impossible
duel, endeavored to turn the conversation; but he could not succeed.
Milady kept him within the limits she had traced beforehand with her
irresistible spirit and her iron will.
Dâ€™Artagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising Milady to
renounce, by pardoning de Wardes, the furious projects she had formed.
But at the first word the young woman started, and exclaimed in a sharp,
bantering tone, which sounded strangely in the darkness, â€œAre you
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
a tone that it appeared to Milady an undoubted proof of devotion. This
reassured her.
We cannot say how long the night seemed to Milady, but dâ€™Artagnan
believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through
the window blinds, and invaded the chamber with its paleness. Seeing
dâ€™Artagnan about to leave her, Milady recalled his promise to avenge her
on the Comte de Wardes.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThanks, my brave lover; but as you are satisfied of my love, you must,

NA
NA
NA
NA

Milady looked at her lover in silence. The pale light of the first rays
of day gave to her clear eyes a strangely frightful expression.
NA
â€œNo, I do not hesitate; but I really pity this poor Comte de Wardes,
since you have ceased to love him. I think that a man must be so
severely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no

NA
â€œAt least, I am now at liberty to believe, without too much fatuity,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThat he is far from being, or rather having been, so guilty toward you

NA
NA
And she looked at dâ€™Artagnan, who embraced her tenderly, with eyes which
seemed to burn themselves away.
NA
end, â€œand since your love is mine, and I am satisfied I possess it--for

NA
NA

â€œIf I had the least doubt of your love I would not make it, but you love

NA
â€œThen if through excess of love I have rendered myself culpable toward

Dâ€™Artagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to Miladyâ€™s,
but she evaded him.
NA
â€œYou gave de Wardes a meeting on Thursday last in this very room, did
NA
NA
with a countenance so unchanged, that if dâ€™Artagnan had not been in such
perfect possession of the fact, he would have doubted.
NA
NA
NA
â€œBe satisfied; you are not guilty toward me, and I have already pardoned
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThat ring I have! The Comte de Wardes of Thursday and the dâ€™Artagnan of

The imprudent young man expected a surprise, mixed with shame--a slight
storm which would resolve itself into tears; but he was strangely
deceived, and his error was not of long duration.
Pale and trembling, Milady repulsed dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s attempted embrace by a
violent blow on the chest, as she sprang out of bed.
It was almost broad daylight.
Dâ€™Artagnan detained her by her night dress of fine India linen, to
implore her pardon; but she, with a strong movement, tried to escape.
Then the cambric was torn from her beautiful shoulders; and on one of
those lovely shoulders, round and white, dâ€™Artagnan recognized, with
inexpressible astonishment, the FLEUR-DE-LIS--that indelible mark which
the hand of the infamous executioner had imprinted.
NA
remaining mute, motionless, and frozen.
But Milady felt herself denounced even by his terror. He had doubtless
seen all. The young man now knew her secret, her terrible secret--the
secret she concealed even from her maid with such care, the secret of
which all the world was ignorant, except himself.
She turned upon him, no longer like a furious woman, but like a wounded
panther.
NA
NA
And she flew to a little inlaid casket which stood upon the dressing
table, opened it with a feverish and trembling hand, drew from it a
small poniard, with a golden haft and a sharp thin blade, and then threw
herself with a bound upon dâ€™Artagnan.
Although the young man was brave, as we know, he was terrified at that
wild countenance, those terribly dilated pupils, those pale cheeks, and
those bleeding lips. He recoiled to the other side of the room as he
would have done from a serpent which was crawling toward him, and his
sword coming in contact with his nervous hand, he drew it almost
unconsciously from the scabbard. But without taking any heed of the
sword, Milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him, and did
not stop till she felt the sharp point at her throat.
She then tried to seize the sword with her hands; but dâ€™Artagnan kept it
free from her grasp, and presenting the point, sometimes at her eyes,
sometimes at her breast, compelled her to glide behind the bedstead,
while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to Kittyâ€™s
apartment.
Milady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury,
screaming in a formidable way.
As all this, however, bore some resemblance to a duel, dâ€™Artagnan began
to recover himself little by little.
NA
calm yourself, I will design a second FLEUR-DE-LIS upon one of those

NA
But dâ€™Artagnan, still keeping on the defensive, drew near to Kittyâ€™s
door. At the noise they made, she in overturning the furniture in her
efforts to get at him, he in screening himself behind the furniture to
keep out of her reach, Kitty opened the door. Dâ€™Artagnan, who had
unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point, was not at more than three
paces from it. With one spring he flew from the chamber of Milady into
that of the maid, and quick as lightning, he slammed to the door, and
placed all his weight against it, while Kitty pushed the bolts.
Then Milady attempted to tear down the doorcase, with a strength
apparently above that of a woman; but finding she could not accomplish
this, she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard, the point of
which repeatedly glittered through the wood. Every blow was accompanied
with terrible imprecations.
NA
bolts were fast, â€œlet me get out of the hotel; for if we leave her time

NA
NA
found himself in, â€œthatâ€™s true. But dress me as well as you are able,

Kitty was but too well aware of that. In a turn of the hand she muffled
him up in a flowered robe, a large hood, and a cloak. She gave him some
slippers, in which he placed his naked feet, and then conducted him down
the stairs. It was time. Milady had already rung her bell, and roused
the whole hotel. The porter was drawing the cord at the moment Milady

The young man fled while she was still threatening him with an impotent
gesture. The moment she lost sight of him, Milady tumbled fainting into
her chamber.
38 HOW, WITHOUT INCOMMDING HIMSELF, ATHOS PROCURES HIS EQUIPMENT
Dâ€™Artagnan was so completely bewildered that without taking any heed of
what might become of Kitty he ran at full speed across half Paris, and
did not stop till he came to Athosâ€™s door. The confusion of his mind,
the terror which spurred him on, the cries of some of the patrol who
started in pursuit of him, and the hooting of the people who,
notwithstanding the early hour, were going to their work, only made him
precipitate his course.
He crossed the court, ran up the two flights to Athosâ€™s apartment, and
knocked at the door enough to break it down.
Grimaud came, rubbing his half-open eyes, to answer this noisy summons,
and dâ€™Artagnan sprang with such violence into the room as nearly to
overturn the astonished lackey.
In spite of his habitual silence, the poor lad this time found his
speech.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan threw off his hood, and disengaged his hands from the folds
of the cloak. At sight of the mustaches and the naked sword, the poor
devil perceived he had to deal with a man. He then concluded it must be
an assassin.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Grimaud contented himself with pointing dâ€™Artagnan out to his master
with his finger.
Athos recognized his comrade, and phlegmatic as he was, he burst into a
laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his
eyes--petticoats falling over his shoes, sleeves tucked up, and
mustaches stiff with agitation.
NA
NA
And he pronounced these words with such a solemn air and with such a
real appearance of terror, that Athos eagerly seized his hand, crying,
NA
â€œNo, but I have just met with a terrible adventure! Are you alone,
NA
NA
NA
NA
they might not be disturbed. â€œIs the king dead? Have you killed the
cardinal? You are quite upset! Come, come, tell me; I am dying with
NA
NA
appearing in his shirt, â€œprepare yourself to hear an incredible, an
NA
NA
friend.
Dâ€™Artagnan donned the robe as quickly as he could, mistaking one sleeve
for the other, so greatly was he still agitated.
NA
NA
lowering his voice, â€œMilady is marked with a FLEUR-DE-LIS upon her
NA
NA
NA
NA
heard him.
NA
Athos uttered a groan, and let his head sink on his hands.
NA
NA
NA
â€œBlue and clear eyes, of a strange brilliancy, with black eyelids and
NA
NA
â€œTall, well-made? She has lost a tooth, next to the eyetooth on the
NA
NA
â€œThe FLEUR-DE-LIS is small, rosy in color, and looks as if efforts had
NA
NA
NA
â€œShe is called Milady, but she may be French. Lord de Winter is only her
NA
NA
â€œBeware, Athos, beware. You tried to kill her; she is a woman to return
NA
NA
â€œShe is capable of anything or everything. Did you ever see her
NA
NA
â€œA tigress, a panther! Ah, my dear Athos, I am greatly afraid I have
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan then related all--the mad passion of Milady and her menaces
of death.
NA
Athos. â€œFortunately, the day after tomorrow we leave Paris. We are going
NA
â€œShe will follow you to the end of the world, Athos, if she recognizes
NA
NA
NA
â€œThere is something horribly mysterious under all this, Athos; this
NA
â€œIn that case, take care! If the cardinal does not hold you in high
admiration for the affair of London, he entertains a great hatred for
you; but as, considering everything, he cannot accuse you openly, and as
hatred must be satisfied, particularly when itâ€™s a cardinalâ€™s hatred,
take care of yourself. If you go out, do not go out alone; when you eat,
use every precaution. Mistrust everything, in short, even your own
NA
NA
after tomorrow evening, for when once with the army, we shall have, I
NA
NA
wherever you go, I will go with you. You must return to the Rue des
NA
NA
NA
NA
Grimaud entered.
Athos made him a sign to go to dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s residence, and bring back
some clothes. Grimaud replied by another sign that he understood
perfectly, and set off.
NA
mistaken, you have left the best of your apparel with Milady, and she
will certainly not have the politeness to return it to you. Fortunately,
NA
â€œThe jewel is yours, my dear Athos! Did you not tell me it was a family
NA
â€œYes, my grandfather gave two thousand crowns for it, as he once told
me. It formed part of the nuptial present he made his wife, and it is
magnificent. My mother gave it to me, and I, fool as I was, instead of
NA
â€œThen, my friend, take back this ring, to which I see you attach much

â€œI take back the ring, after it has passed through the hands of that

â€œPledge it, then; you can borrow at least a thousand crowns on it. With
that sum you can extricate yourself from your present difficulties; and
when you are full of money again, you can redeem it, and take it back
cleansed from its ancient stains, as it will have passed through the
NA
Athos smiled.
NA
cheerfulness raises poor souls in affliction. Well, let us pledge the
NA
NA
â€œThat there shall be five hundred crowns for you, and five hundred
NA
â€œDonâ€™t dream it, Athos. I donâ€™t need the quarter of such a sum--I who am
still only in the Guards--and by selling my saddles, I shall procure it.
What do I want? A horse for Planchet, thatâ€™s all. Besides, you forget
NA
â€œTo which you attach more value, it seems, than I do to mine; at least,
NA
â€œYes, for in any extreme circumstance it might not only extricate us
from some great embarrassment, but even a great danger. It is not only a
NA
â€œI donâ€™t at all understand you, but I believe all you say to be true.
Let us return to my ring, or rather to yours. You shall take half the
sum that will be advanced upon it, or I will throw it into the Seine;
and I doubt, as was the case with Polycrates, whether any fish will be
NA
NA
At this moment Grimaud returned, accompanied by Planchet; the latter,
anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him,
had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments himself.
dâ€™Artagnan dressed himself, and Athos did the same. When the two were
ready to go out, the latter made Grimaud the sign of a man taking aim,
and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon, and prepared to
follow his master.
They arrived without accident at the Rue des Fossoyeurs. Bonacieux was
standing at the door, and looked at dâ€™Artagnan hatefully.
NA
NA
NA
Sure enough! Upon the landing leading to the chamber, and crouching
against the door, he found the poor girl, all in a tremble. As soon as
she perceived him, she cried, â€œYou have promised your protection; you
have promised to save me from her anger. Remember, it is you who have
NA
NA
NA
NA
made. She was mad with passion. There exist no imprecations she did not
pour out against you. Then I thought she would remember it was through
my chamber you had penetrated hers, and that then she would suppose I
was your accomplice; so I took what little money I had and the best of
my things, and I got away.
â€œPoor dear girl! But what can I do with you? I am going away the day
NA
â€œDo what you please, Monsieur Chevalier. Help me out of Paris; help me
NA
NA
dâ€™Artagnan.
â€œNo; but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of your
NA
â€œMy dear little love! In my country the ladies do without chambermaids.
But stop! I can manage your business for you. Planchet, go and find
Aramis. Request him to come here directly. We have something very
NA
NA
NA
NA
dâ€™Artagnan, laughing. â€œBesides, Kitty would not like to live in the Rue
NA
NA
NA
â€œMeanwhile, Kitty, when we are about to separate, and you are no longer
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
sure of that. But now answer me. I attach great importance to the
question I am about to put to you. Did you never hear talk of a young
NA
NA
â€œNo, no; it is one of my friends who loves her--Monsieur Athos, this
NA
NA
about to tread upon an adder.
NA
interest we both take in this poor little Madame Bonacieux. Besides,
NA
continued dâ€™Artagnan, â€œshe is the wife of that frightful baboon you saw
NA
â€œOh, my God! You remind me of my fright! If he should have known me
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œMy dear Athos, we are enveloped in a network of spies. And do you
NA
â€œI pulled down my hood as soon as I saw him, but perhaps it was too
NA
â€œGo down, Athos--he mistrusts you less than me--and see if he be still
NA
Athos went down and returned immediately.
NA
â€œHe has gone to make his report, and to say that all the pigeons are at
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
At that moment Aramis entered.
The matter was all explained to him, and the friends gave him to
understand that among all his high connections he must find a place for
Kitty.
Aramis reflected for a minute, and then said, coloring, â€œWill it be
NA
NA
â€œVery well. Madame de Bois-Tracy asked me, for one of her friends who
resides in the provinces, I believe, for a trustworthy maid. If you can,
NA
â€œOh, monsieur, be assured that I shall be entirely devoted to the person
NA
NA
He placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed
with a ring, and gave the billet to Kitty.
NA
for any of us to be here. Therefore let us separate. We shall meet again
NA
NA
NA
NA
downstairs.
An instant afterward the three young men separated, agreeing to meet
again at four oâ€™clock with Athos, and leaving Planchet to guard the
house.
Aramis returned home, and Athos and dâ€™Artagnan busied themselves about
pledging the sapphire.
As the Gascon had foreseen, they easily obtained three hundred pistoles
on the ring. Still further, the Jew told them that if they would sell it
to him, as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings, he would
give five hundred pistoles for it.
Athos and dâ€™Artagnan, with the activity of two soldiers and the
knowledge of two connoisseurs, hardly required three hours to purchase
the entire equipment of the Musketeer. Besides, Athos was very easy, and
a noble to his fingersâ€™ ends. When a thing suited him he paid the price
demanded, without thinking to ask for any abatement. Dâ€™Artagnan would
have remonstrated at this; but Athos put his hand upon his shoulder,
with a smile, and dâ€™Artagnan understood that it was all very well for
such a little Gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain, but not
for a man who had the bearing of a prince. The Musketeer met with a
superb Andalusian horse, black as jet, nostrils of fire, legs clean and
elegant, rising six years. He examined him, and found him sound and
without blemish. They asked a thousand livres for him.
He might perhaps have been bought for less; but while dâ€™Artagnan was
discussing the price with the dealer, Athos was counting out the money
on the table.
Grimaud had a stout, short Picard cob, which cost three hundred livres.
But when the saddle and arms for Grimaud were purchased, Athos had not a
sou left of his hundred and fifty pistoles. Dâ€™Artagnan offered his
friend a part of his share which he should return when convenient.
But Athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his shoulders.
â€œHow much did the Jew say he would give for the sapphire if he purchased
NA
NA
â€œThat is to say, two hundred more--a hundred pistoles for you and a
hundred pistoles for me. Well, now, that would be a real fortune to us,
NA
NA
â€œThis ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances; then we
shall never be masters of three hundred pistoles to redeem it, so that
we really should lose two hundred pistoles by the bargain. Go and tell
him the ring is his, dâ€™Artagnan, and bring back the two hundred pistoles
NA
NA
â€œReady money is needful for the present time, and we must learn how to
make sacrifices. Go, dâ€™Artagnan, go; Grimaud will accompany you with his
NA
A half hour afterward, dâ€™Artagnan returned with the two thousand livres,
and without having met with any accident.
It was thus Athos found at home resources which he did not expect.
39 A VISION
At four oâ€™clock the four friends were all assembled with Athos. Their
anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared, and each countenance
only preserved the expression of its own secret disquiet--for behind all
present happiness is concealed a fear for the future.
Suddenly Planchet entered, bringing two letters for dâ€™Artagnan.
The one was a little billet, genteelly folded, with a pretty seal in
green wax on which was impressed a dove bearing a green branch.
The other was a large square epistle, resplendent with the terrible arms
of his Eminence the cardinal duke.
At the sight of the little letter the heart of dâ€™Artagnan bounded, for
he believed he recognized the handwriting, and although he had seen that
writing but once, the memory of it remained at the bottom of his heart.
He therefore seized the little epistle, and opened it eagerly.
NA
in the evening, on the road to Chaillot, and look carefully into the
carriages that pass; but if you have any consideration for your own life
or that of those who love you, do not speak a single word, do not make a
movement which may lead anyone to believe you have recognized her who
exposes herself to everything for the sake of seeing you but for an

No signature.
NA
NA
NA
road of Chaillot is quite deserted; you might as well go and ride in the

NA
NA
NA
said Porthos.
NA
not to be seen, remember, you compromise her, dâ€™Artagnan; which is not
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes; but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a
NA
NA
after the carriage, and exterminate those who may be in it. They must be

NA

NA
careless manner.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
me, however, that the seal denotes that it deserves to be opened. For my
part, I declare, dâ€™Artagnan, I think it of much more consequence than
the little piece of waste paper you have so cunningly slipped into your
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan blushed.
NA
NA
â€œM. dâ€™Artagnan, of the kingâ€™s Guards, company Dessessart, is expected at
the Palais-Cardinal this evening, at eight oâ€™clock.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œOne is for seven oâ€™clock, and the other for eight; there will be time
NA
NA
decline a rendezvous with a lady; but a prudent gentleman may excuse
himself from not waiting on his Eminence, particularly when he has
NA
NA
NA
Cavois a similar invitation from his Eminence. I neglected it, and on
the morrow a serious misfortune happened to me--Constance disappeared.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
promptness and decision, as if that were the simplest thing in the
world, â€œto be sure we will get you out; but meantime, as we are to set
off the day after tomorrow, you would do much better not to risk this
NA
NA
during the whole evening. Let each of us wait at a gate of the palace
with three Musketeers behind him; if we see a close carriage, at all
suspicious in appearance, come out, let us fall upon it. It is a long
time since we have had a skirmish with the Guards of Monsieur the
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
to hold themselves in readiness by eight oâ€™clock; the rendezvous, the
Place du Palais-Cardinal. Meantime, you see that the lackeys saddle the
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, my dear Aramis, you donâ€™t want three horses? I cannot comprehend
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo, the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of
livery, who would not tell me in whose service he was, and who said he
NA
NA
NA
I said, that he had received orders from his master or mistress to place
NA
NA
NA
the two horses will you ride--that which you bought or the one that was
NA
â€œThat which was given to me, assuredly. You cannot for a moment imagine,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWith the greatest care. The safety of the horseman, you know, depends
NA
NA
â€œI was going to make you the offer, my dear dâ€™Artagnan, giving you all
NA
NA
NA
NA
taking the sum from his pocket; â€œI know that is the coin in which you

NA
NA
And dâ€™Artagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his pocket.
â€œSend your saddle, then, to the hotel of the Musketeers, and your horse
NA
NA
A quarter of an hour afterward Porthos appeared at the end of the Rue
Ferou on a very handsome genet. Mousqueton followed him upon an Auvergne
horse, small but very handsome. Porthos was resplendent with joy and
pride.
At the same time, Aramis made his appearance at the other end of the
street upon a superb English charger. Bazin followed him upon a roan,
holding by the halter a vigorous Mecklenburg horse; this was
dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s mount.
The two Musketeers met at the gate. Athos and dâ€™Artagnan watched their
approach from the window.
NA
NA
NA
me at first. A bad joke of the husbandâ€™s substituted the other; but the
NA
Planchet and Grimaud appeared in their turn, leading their mastersâ€™
steeds. Dâ€™Artagnan and Athos put themselves into saddle with their
companions, and all four set forward; Athos upon a horse he owed to a
woman, Aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress, Porthos on a horse he
owed to his procuratorâ€™s wife, and dâ€™Artagnan on a horse he owed to his
good fortune--the best mistress possible.
The lackeys followed.
As Porthos had foreseen, the cavalcade produced a good effect; and if
Mme. Coquenard had met Porthos and seen what a superb appearance he made
upon his handsome Spanish genet, she would not have regretted the
bleeding she had inflicted upon the strongbox of her husband.
Near the Louvre the four friends met with M. de Treville, who was
returning from St. Germain; he stopped them to offer his compliments
upon their appointments, which in an instant drew round them a hundred
gapers.
Dâ€™Artagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to M. de Treville of
the letter with the great red seal and the cardinalâ€™s arms. It is well
understood that he did not breathe a word about the other.
M de Treville approved of the resolution he had adopted, and assured him
that if on the morrow he did not appear, he himself would undertake to
find him, let him be where he might.
At this moment the clock of La Samaritaine struck six; the four friends
pleaded an engagement, and took leave of M. de Treville.
A short gallop brought them to the road of Chaillot; the day began to
decline, carriages were passing and repassing. Dâ€™Artagnan, keeping at
some distance from his friends, darted a scrutinizing glance into every
carriage that appeared, but saw no face with which he was acquainted.
At length, after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was
beginning to thicken, a carriage appeared, coming at a quick pace on the
road of Sevres. A presentiment instantly told dâ€™Artagnan that this
carriage contained the person who had appointed the rendezvous; the
young man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so violently.
Almost instantly a female head was put out at the window, with two
fingers placed upon her mouth, either to enjoin silence or to send him a
kiss. Dâ€™Artagnan uttered a slight cry of joy; this woman, or rather this
apparition--for the carriage passed with the rapidity of a vision--was
Mme. Bonacieux.
By an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given,
dâ€™Artagnan put his horse into a gallop, and in a few strides overtook
the carriage; but the window was hermetically closed, the vision had
disappeared.
Dâ€™Artagnan then remembered the injunction: â€œIf you value your own life
or that of those who love you, remain motionless, and as if you had seen
NA
He stopped, therefore, trembling not for himself but for the poor woman
who had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this
rendezvous.
The carriage pursued its way, still going at a great pace, till it
dashed into Paris, and disappeared.
Dâ€™Artagnan remained fixed to the spot, astounded and not knowing what to
think. If it was Mme. Bonacieux and if she was returning to Paris, why
this fugitive rendezvous, why this simple exchange of a glance, why this
lost kiss? If, on the other side, it was not she--which was still quite
possible--for the little light that remained rendered a mistake
easy--might it not be the commencement of some plot against him through
the allurement of this woman, for whom his love was known?
His three companions joined him. All had plainly seen a womanâ€™s head
appear at the window, but none of them, except Athos, knew Mme.
Bonacieux. The opinion of Athos was that it was indeed she; but less
preoccupied by that pretty face than dâ€™Artagnan, he had fancied he saw a
second head, a manâ€™s head, inside the carriage.
NA
her from one prison to another. But what can they intend to do with the
NA
NA
whom we are not likely to meet again on this earth. You know something
of that, as well as I do, I think. Now, if your mistress is not dead, if
it is she we have just seen, you will meet with her again some day or
NA
NA
Half past seven had sounded. The carriage had been twenty minutes behind
the time appointed. Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s friends reminded him that he had a
visit to pay, but at the same time bade him observe that there was yet
time to retract.
But dâ€™Artagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious. He had made
up his mind that he would go to the Palais-Cardinal, and that he would
learn what his Eminence had to say to him. Nothing could turn him from
his purpose.
They reached the Rue St. Honore, and in the Place du Palais-Cardinal
they found the twelve invited Musketeers, walking about in expectation
of their comrades. There only they explained to them the matter in hand.
Dâ€™Artagnan was well known among the honorable corps of the kingâ€™s
Musketeers, in which it was known he would one day take his place; he
was considered beforehand as a comrade. It resulted from these
antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which
they met; besides, it would not be unlikely that they would have an
opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn,
and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready.
Athos divided them into three groups, assumed the command of one, gave
the second to Aramis, and the third to Porthos; and then each group went
and took their watch near an entrance.
Dâ€™Artagnan, on his part, entered boldly at the principal gate.
Although he felt himself ably supported, the young man was not without a
little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase, step by step. His
conduct toward Milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery, and he was
very suspicious of the political relations which existed between that
woman and the cardinal. Still further, de Wardes, whom he had treated so
ill, was one of the tools of his Eminence; and dâ€™Artagnan knew that
while his Eminence was terrible to his enemies, he was strongly attached
to his friends.
â€œIf de Wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal, which is not
to be doubted, and if he has recognized me, as is probable, I may
NA
head. â€œBut why has he waited till now? Thatâ€™s all plain enough. Milady
has laid her complaints against me with that hypocritical grief which
renders her so interesting, and this last offense has made the cup
NA
NA
not allow me to be carried away without a struggle. Nevertheless,
Monsieur de Trevilleâ€™s company of Musketeers alone cannot maintain a war
against the cardinal, who disposes of the forces of all France, and
before whom the queen is without power and the king without will.
Dâ€™Artagnan, my friend, you are brave, you are prudent, you have
NA
He came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the antechamber. He
placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty, who led him into
the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the palace.
In this waiting room were five or six of the cardinals Guards, who
recognized dâ€™Artagnan, and knowing that it was he who had wounded
Jussac, they looked upon him with a smile of singular meaning.
This smile appeared to dâ€™Artagnan to be of bad augury. Only, as our
Gascon was not easily intimidated--or rather, thanks to a great pride
natural to the men of his country, he did not allow one easily to see
what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all
resembled fear--he placed himself haughtily in front of Messieurs the
Guards, and waited with his hand on his hip, in an attitude by no means
deficient in majesty.
The usher returned and made a sign to dâ€™Artagnan to follow him. It
appeared to the young man that the Guards, on seeing him depart,
chuckled among themselves.
He traversed a corridor, crossed a grand saloon, entered a library, and
found himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and writing.
The usher introduced him, and retired without speaking a word.
Dâ€™Artagnan remained standing and examined this man.
Dâ€™Artagnan at first believed that he had to do with some judge examining
his papers; but he perceived that the man at the desk wrote, or rather
corrected, lines of unequal length, scanning the words on his fingers.
He saw then that he was with a poet. At the end of an instant the poet
closed his manuscript, upon the cover of which was written â€œMirame, a
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan recognized the cardinal.
40 A TERRIBLE VISION
The cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript, his cheek upon his
hand, and looked intently at the young man for a moment. No one had a
more searching eye than the Cardinal de Richelieu, and dâ€™Artagnan felt
this glance run through his veins like a fever.
He however kept a good countenance, holding his hat in his hand and
awaiting the good pleasure of his Eminence, without too much assurance,
but also without too much humility.
NA
NA
â€œThere are several branches of the dâ€™Artagnans at Tarbes and in its

indicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate it.

Monsieur de Treville is a skilled physiognomist, who knows men at first

Dessessart, leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter

NA
â€œSince that time many things have happened to you. You were walking one
day behind the Chartreux, when it would have been better if you had been
elsewhere. Then you took with your friends a journey to the waters of
Forges; they stopped on the road, but you continued yours. That is all

it is my office to know everything. On your return you were received by

quickly turned the stone inward; but it was too late.

NA
â€œHow could that be, monsieur? Could you incur my displeasure by having
followed the orders of your superiors with more intelligence and courage
than another would have done? It is the people who do not obey that I
punish, and not those who, like you, obey--but too well. As a proof,
remember the date of the day on which I had you bidden to come to me,
NA
That was the very evening when the abduction of Mme. Bonacieux took
place. Dâ€™Artagnan trembled; and he likewise recollected that during the
past half hour the poor woman had passed close to him, without doubt
carried away by the same power that had caused her disappearance.
NA
some time past, I wished to know what you were doing. Besides, you owe
me some thanks. You must yourself have remarked how much you have been

Dâ€™Artagnan bowed with respect.
NA
natural equity, but likewise from a plan I have marked out with respect
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan became more and more astonished.
â€œI wished to explain this plan to you on the day you received my first
invitation; but you did not come. Fortunately, nothing is lost by this
delay, and you are now about to hear it. Sit down there, before me,
NA
cardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young man, who was
so astonished at what was passing that he awaited a second sign from his
interlocutor before he obeyed.

young as you are, and scarcely entering into the world, you have

â€œYes, thatâ€™s true; but alone as you are, you have done much already, and
will do still more, I donâ€™t doubt. Yet you have need, I believe, to be
guided in the adventurous career you have undertaken; for, if I mistake

â€œBut it appears to me that my Guards--mine--are also his Majestyâ€™s

NA
â€œYou want a pretext, do you not? I comprehend. Well, you have this
excuse: advancement, the opening campaign, the opportunity which I offer
you--so much for the world. As regards yourself, the need of protection;
for it is fit you should know, Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan, that I have received
heavy and serious complaints against you. You do not consecrate your

resolution; and your services, well directed, instead of leading you to

Dâ€™Artagnan paused.
NA
â€œThen, I will presume to say that all my friends are in the kingâ€™s
Musketeers and Guards, and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies
are in the service of your Eminence; I should, therefore, be ill
received here and ill regarded there if I accepted what Monseigneur

the contrary, I think I have not proved myself worthy of your goodness.
The siege of La Rochelle is about to be resumed, monseigneur. I shall
serve under the eye of your Eminence, and if I have the good fortune to
conduct myself at the siege in such a manner as merits your attention,
then I shall at least leave behind me some brilliant action to justify
the protection with which you honor me. Everything is best in its time,
monseigneur. Hereafter, perhaps, I shall have the right of giving

with a tone of vexation, through which, however, might be seen a sort of

friends. We owe nothing to our enemies; and let me give you a piece of
advice; take care of yourself, Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan, for from the moment
I withdraw my hand from behind you, I would not give an obolus for your
NA
NA
confidence.
â€œRemember at a later period and at a certain moment, if any mischance

see each other again after the campaign. I will have my eye upon you,

NA
NA
NA
This last expression of Richelieuâ€™s conveyed a terrible doubt; it
alarmed dâ€™Artagnan more than a menace would have done, for it was a
warning. The cardinal, then, was seeking to preserve him from some
misfortune which threatened him. He opened his mouth to reply, but with
a haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed him.
Dâ€™Artagnan went out, but at the door his heart almost failed him, and he
felt inclined to return. Then the noble and severe countenance of Athos
crossed his mind; if he made the compact with the cardinal which he
required, Athos would no more give him his hand--Athos would renounce
him.
It was this fear that restrained him, so powerful is the influence of a
truly great character on all that surrounds it.
Dâ€™Artagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered, and found
Athos and the four Musketeers waiting his appearance, and beginning to
grow uneasy. With a word, dâ€™Artagnan reassured them; and Planchet ran to
inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer, as
his master had come out safe from the Palais-Cardinal.
Returned home with Athos, Aramis and Porthos inquired eagerly the cause
of the strange interview; but dâ€™Artagnan confined himself to telling
them that M. de Richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter
into his guards with the rank of ensign, and that he had refused.
NA
Athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing. But when they
were alone he said, â€œYou have done that which you ought to have done,
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan sighed deeply, for this voice responded to a secret voice of
his soul, which told him that great misfortunes awaited him.
The whole of the next day was spent in preparations for departure.
Dâ€™Artagnan went to take leave of M. de Treville. At that time it was
believed that the separation of the Musketeers and the Guards would be
but momentary, the king holding his Parliament that very day and
proposing to set out the day after. M. de Treville contented himself
with asking dâ€™Artagnan if he could do anything for him, but dâ€™Artagnan
answered that he was supplied with all he wanted.
That night brought together all those comrades of the Guards of M.
Dessessart and the company of Musketeers of M. de Treville who had been
accustomed to associate together. They were parting to meet again when
it pleased God, and if it pleased God. That night, then, was somewhat
riotous, as may be imagined. In such cases extreme preoccupation is only
to be combated by extreme carelessness.
At the first sound of the morning trumpet the friends separated; the
Musketeers hastening to the hotel of M. de Treville, the Guards to that
of M. Dessessart. Each of the captains then led his company to the
Louvre, where the king held his review.
The king was dull and appeared ill, which detracted a little from his
usual lofty bearing. In fact, the evening before, a fever had seized him
in the midst of the Parliament, while he was holding his Bed of Justice.
He had, not the less, decided upon setting out that same evening; and in
spite of the remonstrances that had been offered to him, he persisted in
having the review, hoping by setting it at defiance to conquer the
disease which began to lay hold upon him.
The review over, the Guards set forward alone on their march, the
Musketeers waiting for the king, which allowed Porthos time to go and
take a turn in his superb equipment in the Rue aux Ours.
The procuratorâ€™s wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine
horse. She loved Porthos too dearly to allow him to part thus; she made
him a sign to dismount and come to her. Porthos was magnificent; his
spurs jingled, his cuirass glittered, his sword knocked proudly against
his ample limbs. This time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh,
such a real ear clipper did Porthos appear.
The Musketeer was introduced to M. Coquenard, whose little gray eyes
sparkled with anger at seeing his cousin all blazing new. Nevertheless,
one thing afforded him inward consolation; it was expected by everybody
that the campaign would be a severe one. He whispered a hope to himself
that this beloved relative might be killed in the field.
Porthos paid his compliments to M. Coquenard and bade him farewell. M.
Coquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities. As to Mme. Coquenard,
she could not restrain her tears; but no evil impressions were taken
from her grief as she was known to be very much attached to her
relatives, about whom she was constantly having serious disputes with
her husband.
But the real adieux were made in Mme. Coquenardâ€™s chamber; they were
heartrending.
As long as the procuratorâ€™s wife could follow him with her eyes, she
waved her handkerchief to him, leaning so far out of the window as to
lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself. Porthos
received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such
demonstrations, only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his
hat gracefully, and waved it to her as a sign of adieu.
On his part Aramis wrote a long letter. To whom? Nobody knew. Kitty, who
was to set out that evening for Tours, was waiting in the next chamber.
Athos sipped the last bottle of his Spanish wine.
In the meantime dâ€™Artagnan was defiling with his company. Arriving at
the Faubourg St. Antoine, he turned round to look gaily at the Bastille;
but as it was the Bastille alone he looked at, he did not observe
Milady, who, mounted upon a light chestnut horse, designated him with
her finger to two ill-looking men who came close up to the ranks to take
notice of him. To a look of interrogation which they made, Milady
replied by a sign that it was he. Then, certain that there could be no
mistake in the execution of her orders, she started her horse and
disappeared.
The two men followed the company, and on leaving the Faubourg St.
Antoine, mounted two horses properly equipped, which a servant without
livery had waiting for them.
41 THE SEIGE OF LA ROCHELLE
The Siege of La Rochelle was one of the great political events of the
reign of Louis XIII, and one of the great military enterprises of the
cardinal. It is, then, interesting and even necessary that we should say
a few words about it, particularly as many details of this siege are
connected in too important a manner with the story we have undertaken to
relate to allow us to pass it over in silence.
The political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were
extensive. Let us unfold them first, and then pass on to the private
plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his Eminence than the
others.
Of the important cities given up by Henry IV to the Huguenots as places
of safety, there only remained La Rochelle. It became necessary,
therefore, to destroy this last bulwark of Calvinism--a dangerous leaven
with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly
mingling.
Spaniards, Englishmen, and Italian malcontents, adventurers of all
nations, and soldiers of fortune of every sect, flocked at the first
summons under the standard of the Protestants, and organized themselves
like a vast association, whose branches diverged freely over all parts
of Europe.
La Rochelle, which had derived a new importance from the ruin of the
other Calvinist cities, was, then, the focus of dissensions and
ambition. Moreover, its port was the last in the kingdom of France open
to the English, and by closing it against England, our eternal enemy,
the cardinal completed the work of Joan of Arc and the Duc de Guise.
Thus Bassompierre, who was at once Protestant and Catholic--Protestant
by conviction and Catholic as commander of the order of the Holy Ghost;
Bassompierre, who was a German by birth and a Frenchman at heart--in
short, Bassompierre, who had a distinguished command at the siege of La
Rochelle, said, in charging at the head of several other Protestant
nobles like himself, â€œYou will see, gentlemen, that we shall be fools
NA
And Bassompierre was right. The cannonade of the Isle of Re presaged to
him the dragonnades of the Cevennes; the taking of La Rochelle was the
preface to the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.
We have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and
simplifying minister, which belong to history, the chronicler is forced
to recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival.
Richelieu, as everyone knows, had loved the queen. Was this love a
simple political affair, or was it naturally one of those profound
passions which Anne of Austria inspired in those who approached her?
That we are not able to say; but at all events, we have seen, by the
anterior developments of this story, that Buckingham had the advantage
over him, and in two or three circumstances, particularly that of the
diamond studs, had, thanks to the devotedness of the three Musketeers
and the courage and conduct of dâ€™Artagnan, cruelly mystified him.
It was, then, Richelieuâ€™s object, not only to get rid of an enemy of
France, but to avenge himself on a rival; but this vengeance must be
grand and striking and worthy in every way of a man who held in his
hand, as his weapon for combat, the forces of a kingdom.
Richelieu knew that in combating England he combated Buckingham; that in
triumphing over England he triumphed over Buckingham--in short, that in
humiliating England in the eyes of Europe he humiliated Buckingham in
the eyes of the queen.
On his side Buckingham, in pretending to maintain the honor of England,
was moved by interests exactly like those of the cardinal. Buckingham
also was pursuing a private vengeance. Buckingham could not under any
pretense be admitted into France as an ambassador; he wished to enter it
as a conqueror.
It resulted from this that the real stake in this game, which two most
powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men, was
simply a kind look from Anne of Austria.
The first advantage had been gained by Buckingham. Arriving unexpectedly
in sight of the Isle of Re with ninety vessels and nearly twenty
thousand men, he had surprised the Comte de Toiras, who commanded for
the king in the Isle, and he had, after a bloody conflict, effected his
landing.
Allow us to observe in passing that in this fight perished the Baron de
Chantal; that the Baron de Chantal left a little orphan girl eighteen
months old, and that this little girl was afterward Mme. de Sevigne.
The Comte de Toiras retired into the citadel St. Martin with his
garrison, and threw a hundred men into a little fort called the fort of
La Pree.
This event had hastened the resolutions of the cardinal; and till the
king and he could take the command of the siege of La Rochelle, which
was determined, he had sent Monsieur to direct the first operations, and
had ordered all the troops he could dispose of to march toward the
theater of war. It was of this detachment, sent as a vanguard, that our
friend dâ€™Artagnan formed a part.
The king, as we have said, was to follow as soon as his Bed of Justice
had been held; but on rising from his Bed of Justice on the
twenty-eighth of June, he felt himself attacked by fever. He was,
notwithstanding, anxious to set out; but his illness becoming more
serious, he was forced to stop at Villeroy.
Now, whenever the king halted, the Musketeers halted. It followed that
dâ€™Artagnan, who was as yet purely and simply in the Guards, found
himself, for the time at least, separated from his good friends--Athos,
Porthos, and Aramis. This separation, which was no more than an
unpleasant circumstance, would have certainly become a cause of serious
uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was
surrounded.
He, however, arrived without accident in the camp established before La
Rochelle, on the tenth of the month of September of the year 1627.
Everything was in the same state. The Duke of Buckingham and his
English, masters of the Isle of Re, continued to besiege, but without
success, the citadel St. Martin and the fort of La Pree; and hostilities
with La Rochelle had commenced, two or three days before, about a fort
which the Duc dâ€™Angouleme had caused to be constructed near the city.
The Guards, under the command of M. Dessessart, took up their quarters
at the Minimes; but, as we know, dâ€™Artagnan, possessed with ambition to
enter the Musketeers, had formed but few friendships among his comrades,
and he felt himself isolated and given up to his own reflections.
His reflections were not very cheerful. From the time of his arrival in
Paris, he had been mixed up with public affairs; but his own private
affairs had made no great progress, either in love or fortune. As to
love, the only woman he could have loved was Mme. Bonacieux; and Mme.
Bonacieux had disappeared, without his being able to discover what had
become of her. As to fortune, he had made--he, humble as he was--an
enemy of the cardinal; that is to say, of a man before whom trembled the
greatest men of the kingdom, beginning with the king.
That man had the power to crush him, and yet he had not done so. For a
mind so perspicuous as that of dâ€™Artagnan, this indulgence was a light
by which he caught a glimpse of a better future.
Then he had made himself another enemy, less to be feared, he thought;
but nevertheless, he instinctively felt, not to be despised. This enemy
was Milady.
In exchange for all this, he had acquired the protection and good will
of the queen; but the favor of the queen was at the present time an
additional cause of persecution, and her protection, as it was known,
protected badly--as witness Chalais and Mme. Bonacieux.
What he had clearly gained in all this was the diamond, worth five or
six thousand livres, which he wore on his finger; and even this
diamond--supposing that dâ€™Artagnan, in his projects of ambition, wished
to keep it, to make it someday a pledge for the gratitude of the
queen--had not in the meanwhile, since he could not part with it, more
value than the gravel he trod under his feet.
We say the gravel he trod under his feet, for dâ€™Artagnan made these
reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which
led from the camp to the village of Angoutin. Now, these reflections had
led him further than he intended, and the day was beginning to decline
when, by the last ray of the setting sun, he thought he saw the barrel
of a musket glitter from behind a hedge.
Dâ€™Artagnan had a quick eye and a prompt understanding. He comprehended
that the musket had not come there of itself, and that he who bore it
had not concealed himself behind a hedge with any friendly intentions.
He determined, therefore, to direct his course as clear from it as he
could when, on the opposite side of the road, from behind a rock, he
perceived the extremity of another musket.
This was evidently an ambuscade.
The young man cast a glance at the first musket and saw, with a certain
degree of inquietude, that it was leveled in his direction; but as soon
as he perceived that the orifice of the barrel was motionless, he threw
himself upon the ground. At the same instant the gun was fired, and he
heard the whistling of a ball pass over his head.
No time was to be lost. Dâ€™Artagnan sprang up with a bound, and at the
same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the
very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the
ground.
Dâ€™Artagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous
death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a
single step. Besides, courage was out of the question here; dâ€™Artagnan
had fallen into an ambush.
NA
He immediately, therefore, took to his heels and ran toward the camp,
with the swiftness of the young men of his country, so renowned for
their agility; but whatever might be his speed, the first who fired,
having had time to reload, fired a second shot, and this time so well
aimed that it struck his hat, and carried it ten paces from him.
As he, however, had no other hat, he picked up this as he ran, and
arrived at his quarters very pale and quite out of breath. He sat down
without saying a word to anybody, and began to reflect.
This event might have three causes:
The first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the
Rochellais, who might not be sorry to kill one of his Majestyâ€™s Guards,
because it would be an enemy the less, and this enemy might have a
well-furnished purse in his pocket.
Dâ€™Artagnan took his hat, examined the hole made by the ball, and shook
his head. The ball was not a musket ball--it was an arquebus ball. The
accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon
had been employed. This could not, then, be a military ambuscade, as the
ball was not of the regular caliber.
This might be a kind remembrance of Monsieur the Cardinal. It may be
observed that at the very moment when, thanks to the ray of the sun, he
perceived the gun barrel, he was thinking with astonishment on the
forbearance of his Eminence with respect to him.
But dâ€™Artagnan again shook his head. For people toward whom he had but
to put forth his hand, his Eminence had rarely recourse to such means.
It might be a vengeance of Milady; that was most probable.
He tried in vain to remember the faces or dress of the assassins; he had
escaped so rapidly that he had not had leisure to notice anything.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan passed a very bad night. Three or four times he started up,
imagining that a man was approaching his bed for the purpose of stabbing
him. Nevertheless, day dawned without darkness having brought any
accident.
But dâ€™Artagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not
relinquished.
Dâ€™Artagnan remained all day in his quarters, assigning as a reason to
himself that the weather was bad.
At nine oâ€™clock the next morning, the drums beat to arms. The Duc
dâ€™Orleans visited the posts. The guards were under arms, and dâ€™Artagnan
took his place in the midst of his comrades.
Monsieur passed along the front of the line; then all the superior
officers approached him to pay their compliments, M. Dessessart, captain
of the Guards, as well as the others.
At the expiration of a minute or two, it appeared to dâ€™Artagnan that M.
Dessessart made him a sign to approach. He waited for a fresh gesture on
the part of his superior, for fear he might be mistaken; but this
gesture being repeated, he left the ranks, and advanced to receive
orders.
â€œMonsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous
mission, but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it;
and I made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in
NA
NA
than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the
lieutenant general.
In fact the Rochellais had made a sortie during the night, and had
retaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two days
before. The matter was to ascertain, by reconnoitering, how the enemy
guarded this bastion.
At the end of a few minutes Monsieur raised his voice, and said, â€œI want
for this mission three or four volunteers, led by a man who can be

NA
said M. Dessessart, pointing to dâ€™Artagnan; â€œand as to the four or five
volunteers, Monsieur has but to make his intentions known, and the men
NA
NA
dâ€™Artagnan, raising his sword.
Two of his comrades of the Guards immediately sprang forward, and two
other soldiers having joined them, the number was deemed sufficient.
Dâ€™Artagnan declined all others, being unwilling to take the first chance
from those who had the priority.
It was not known whether, after the taking of the bastion, the
Rochellais had evacuated it or left a garrison in it; the object then
was to examine the place near enough to verify the reports.
Dâ€™Artagnan set out with his four companions, and followed the trench;
the two Guards marched abreast with him, and the two soldiers followed
behind.
They arrived thus, screened by the lining of the trench, till they came
within a hundred paces of the bastion. There, on turning round,
dâ€™Artagnan perceived that the two soldiers had disappeared.
He thought that, beginning to be afraid, they had stayed behind, and he
continued to advance.
At the turning of the counterscarp they found themselves within about
sixty paces of the bastion. They saw no one, and the bastion seemed
abandoned.
The three composing our forlorn hope were deliberating whether they
should proceed any further, when all at once a circle of smoke enveloped
the giant of stone, and a dozen balls came whistling around dâ€™Artagnan
and his companions.
They knew all they wished to know; the bastion was guarded. A longer
stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless imprudence.
Dâ€™Artagnan and his two companions turned their backs, and commenced a
retreat which resembled a flight.
On arriving at the angle of the trench which was to serve them as a
rampart, one of the Guardsmen fell. A ball had passed through his
breast. The other, who was safe and sound, continued his way toward the
camp.
Dâ€™Artagnan was not willing to abandon his companion thus, and stooped to
raise him and assist him in regaining the lines; but at this moment two
shots were fired. One ball struck the head of the already-wounded guard,
and the other flattened itself against a rock, after having passed
within two inches of dâ€™Artagnan.
The young man turned quickly round, for this attack could not have come
from the bastion, which was hidden by the angle of the trench. The idea
of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind, and with
them he remembered the assassins of two evenings before. He resolved
this time to know with whom he had to deal, and fell upon the body of
his comrade as if he were dead.
He quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty
paces of him; they were the heads of the two soldiers. Dâ€™Artagnan had
not been deceived; these two men had only followed for the purpose of
assassinating him, hoping that the young manâ€™s death would be placed to
the account of the enemy.
As he might be only wounded and might denounce their crime, they came up
to him with the purpose of making sure. Fortunately, deceived by
dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s trick, they neglected to reload their guns.
When they were within ten paces of him, dâ€™Artagnan, who in falling had
taken care not to let go his sword, sprang up close to them.
The assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without
having killed their man, they should be accused by him; therefore their
first idea was to join the enemy. One of them took his gun by the
barrel, and used it as he would a club. He aimed a terrible blow at
dâ€™Artagnan, who avoided it by springing to one side; but by this
movement he left a passage free to the bandit, who darted off toward the
bastion. As the Rochellais who guarded the bastion were ignorant of the
intentions of the man they saw coming toward them, they fired upon him,
and he fell, struck by a ball which broke his shoulder.
Meantime dâ€™Artagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier, attacking
him with his sword. The conflict was not long; the wretch had nothing to
defend himself with but his discharged arquebus. The sword of the
Guardsman slipped along the barrel of the now-useless weapon, and passed
through the thigh of the assassin, who fell.
Dâ€™Artagnan immediately placed the point of his sword at his throat.

asked the young man, withholding his arm.
â€œYes; if you think existence worth anything to a man of twenty, as you
are, and who may hope for everything, being handsome and brave, as you

NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œMy comrade knows her, and called her so. It was with him she agreed,
and not with me; he even has in his pocket a letter from that person,

something. A hundred louis? Well, that was a temptation for two wretches
like you. I understand why you accepted it, and I grant you my pardon;

â€œYou must nevertheless make up your mind to go and get it, or I swear

â€œPardon, monsieur; pity! In the name of that young lady you love, and

throwing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his hand--for he began
to lose his strength with his blood.
â€œAnd how do you know there is a young woman whom I love, and that I

NA
NA
more delay, no more hesitation; or else whatever may be my repugnance to
soiling my sword a second time with the blood of a wretch like you, I
NA
so fierce a gesture that the wounded man sprang up.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan took the soldierâ€™s arquebus, made him go on before him, and
urged him toward his companion by pricking him behind with his sword.
It was a frightful thing to see this wretch, leaving a long track of
blood on the ground he passed over, pale with approaching death, trying
to drag himself along without being seen to the body of his accomplice,
which lay twenty paces from him.
Terror was so strongly painted on his face, covered with a cold sweat,
that dâ€™Artagnan took pity on him, and casting upon him a look of
NA
of courage and such a coward as you. Stay where you are; I will go
NA
And with a light step, an eye on the watch, observing the movements of
the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground,
dâ€™Artagnan succeeded in reaching the second soldier.
There were two means of gaining his object--to search him on the spot,
or to carry him away, making a buckler of his body, and search him in
the trench.
Dâ€™Artagnan preferred the second means, and lifted the assassin onto his
shoulders at the moment the enemy fired.
A slight shock, the dull noise of three balls which penetrated the
flesh, a last cry, a convulsion of agony, proved to dâ€™Artagnan that the
would-be assassin had saved his life.
Dâ€™Artagnan regained the trench, and threw the corpse beside the wounded
man, who was as pale as death.
Then he began to search. A leather pocketbook, a purse, in which was
evidently a part of the sum which the bandit had received, with a dice
box and dice, completed the possessions of the dead man.
He left the box and dice where they fell, threw the purse to the wounded
man, and eagerly opened the pocketbook.
Among some unimportant papers he found the following letter, that which
he had sought at the risk of his life:
â€œSince you have lost sight of that woman and she is now in safety in the
convent, which you should never have allowed her to reach, try, at
least, not to miss the man. If you do, you know that my hand stretches
far, and that you shall pay very dearly for the hundred louis you have
NA
No signature. Nevertheless it was plain the letter came from Milady. He
consequently kept it as a piece of evidence, and being in safety behind
the angle of the trench, he began to interrogate the wounded man. He
confessed that he had undertaken with his comrade--the same who was
killed--to carry off a young woman who was to leave Paris by the
Barriere de La Villette; but having stopped to drink at a cabaret, they
had missed the carriage by ten minutes.
NA
anguish.
NA
wounded man.
NA
NA
Then the young man tremblingly comprehended what a terrible thirst for
vengeance urged this woman on to destroy him, as well as all who loved
him, and how well she must be acquainted with the affairs of the court,
since she had discovered all. There could be no doubt she owed this
information to the cardinal.
But amid all this he perceived, with a feeling of real joy, that the
queen must have discovered the prison in which poor Mme. Bonacieux was
explaining her devotion, and that she had freed her from that prison;
and the letter he had received from the young woman, and her passage
along the road of Chaillot like an apparition, were now explained.
Then also, as Athos had predicted, it became possible to find Mme.
Bonacieux, and a convent was not impregnable.
This idea completely restored clemency to his heart. He turned toward
the wounded man, who had watched with intense anxiety all the various
expressions of his countenance, and holding out his arm to him, said,
â€œCome, I will not abandon you thus. Lean upon me, and let us return to
NA
NA
NA
NA
The wounded man sank upon his knees, to again kiss the feet of his
preserver; but dâ€™Artagnan, who had no longer a motive for staying so
near the enemy, abridged the testimonials of his gratitude.
The Guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the
death of his four companions. They were therefore much astonished and
delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe and
sound.
Dâ€™Artagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a sortie which
he improvised. He described the death of the other soldier, and the
perils they had encountered. This recital was for him the occasion of
veritable triumph. The whole army talked of this expedition for a day,
and Monsieur paid him his compliments upon it. Besides this, as every
great action bears its recompense with it, the brave exploit of
dâ€™Artagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost.
In fact, dâ€™Artagnan believed that he might be tranquil, as one of his
two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his interests.
This tranquillity proved one thing--that dâ€™Artagnan did not yet know
Milady.
42 THE ANJOU WINE
After the most disheartening news of the kingâ€™s health, a report of his
convalescence began to prevail in the camp; and as he was very anxious
to be in person at the siege, it was said that as soon as he could mount
a horse he would set forward.
Meantime, Monsieur, who knew that from one day to the other he might
expect to be removed from his command by the Duc dâ€™Angouleme, by
Bassompierre, or by Schomberg, who were all eager for his post, did but
little, lost his days in wavering, and did not dare to attempt any great
enterprise to drive the English from the Isle of Re, where they still
besieged the citadel St. Martin and the fort of La Pree, as on their
side the French were besieging La Rochelle.
Dâ€™Artagnan, as we have said, had become more tranquil, as always happens
after a past danger, particularly when the danger seems to have
vanished. He only felt one uneasiness, and that was at not hearing any
tidings from his friends.
But one morning at the commencement of the month of November everything
was explained to him by this letter, dated from Villeroy:
M dâ€™Artagnan,
MM Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, after having had an entertainment at my
house and enjoying themselves very much, created such a disturbance that
the provost of the castle, a rigid man, has ordered them to be confined
for some days; but I accomplish the order they have given me by
forwarding to you a dozen bottles of my Anjou wine, with which they are
much pleased. They are desirous that you should drink to their health in
their favorite wine. I have done this, and am, monsieur, with great
respect,
Your very humble and obedient servant,
Godeau, Purveyor of the Musketeers
NA
pleasures, as I thought of them in my troubles. Well, I will certainly
NA
And dâ€™Artagnan went among those Guardsmen with whom he had formed
greater intimacy than with the others, to invite them to enjoy with him
this present of delicious Anjou wine which had been sent him from
Villeroy.
One of the two Guardsmen was engaged that evening, and another the next,
so the meeting was fixed for the day after that.
Dâ€™Artagnan, on his return, sent the twelve bottles of wine to the
refreshment room of the Guards, with strict orders that great care
should be taken of it; and then, on the day appointed, as the dinner was
fixed for midday dâ€™Artagnan sent Planchet at nine in the morning to
assist in preparing everything for the entertainment.
Planchet, very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord, thought
he would make all ready, like an intelligent man; and with this view
called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his masterâ€™s guests,
named Fourreau, and the false soldier who had tried to kill dâ€™Artagnan
and who, belonging to no corps, had entered into the service of
dâ€™Artagnan, or rather of Planchet, after dâ€™Artagnan had saved his life.
The hour of the banquet being come, the two guards arrived, took their
places, and the dishes were arranged on the table. Planchet waited,
towel on arm; Fourreau uncorked the bottles; and Brisemont, which was
the name of the convalescent, poured the wine, which was a little shaken
by its journey, carefully into decanters. Of this wine, the first bottle
being a little thick at the bottom, Brisemont poured the lees into a
glass, and dâ€™Artagnan desired him to drink it, for the poor devil had
not yet recovered his strength.
The guests having eaten the soup, were about to lift the first glass of
wine to their lips, when all at once the cannon sounded from Fort Louis
and Fort Neuf. The Guardsmen, imagining this to be caused by some
unexpected attack, either of the besieged or the English, sprang to
their swords. Dâ€™Artagnan, not less forward than they, did likewise, and
all ran out, in order to repair to their posts.
But scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of
NA
resounded on every side, and the drums were beaten in all directions.
In short, the king, impatient, as has been said, had come by forced
marches, and had that moment arrived with all his household and a
reinforcement of ten thousand troops. His Musketeers proceeded and
followed him. Dâ€™Artagnan, placed in line with his company, saluted with
an expressive gesture his three friends, whose eyes soon discovered him,
and M. de Treville, who detected him at once.
The ceremony of reception over, the four friends were soon in one
anotherâ€™s arms.
NA
NA
the young man, turning to the two Guards, whom he introduced to his
friends.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, in the absence of champagne and chambertin, you must content
NA
â€œAnd so, connoisseurs in wine as we are, we have sent you some Anjou

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan grew pale, and a convulsive trembling shook all his limbs.
NA
NA
NA
NA
It was now Athos who turned pale.
Dâ€™Artagnan rushed toward the refreshment room, the three Musketeers and
the two Guards following him.
The first object that met the eyes of dâ€™Artagnan on entering the room
was Brisemont, stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible
convulsions.
Planchet and Fourreau, as pale as death, were trying to give him succor;
but it was plain that all assistance was useless--all the features of
the dying man were distorted with agony.
NA
NA
NA
â€œI say that it was you who gave me the wine; I say that it was you who
desired me to drink it. I say you wished to avenge yourself on me, and I
NA
NA
NA
â€œOh, but God is above! God will punish you! My God, grant that he may

NA
man, â€œI swear to you that the wine was poisoned and that I was going to
NA
NA

NA
and Aramis gave orders, a little too late, that a confessor should be
sent for.
NA
NA
addressing the Guardsmen, â€œI request you will be silent with regard to
this adventure. Great personages may have had a hand in what you have

NA
NA
NA
â€œTo the health of the king, monsieur; I was going to drink a small glass

NA
NA
NA

place; so accept my excuses, and put off the party till another day, I

The two Guardsmen courteously accepted dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s excuses, and
perceiving that the four friends desired to be alone, retired.
When the young Guardsman and the three Musketeers were without
witnesses, they looked at one another with an air which plainly
expressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their situation.
NA

And the four friends quit the room, leaving to Planchet and Fourreau the
duty of paying mortuary honors to Brisemont.
The host gave them another chamber, and served them with fresh eggs and
some water, which Athos went himself to draw at the fountain. In a few
words, Porthos and Aramis were posted as to the situation.
NA
NA
Athos shook his head.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œShe is some Englishwoman who has committed a crime in France, and has
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes; but I should think the other must be dead, I hanged her so

It was dâ€™Artagnan who now shook his head in his turn.
NA
â€œThe fact is, one cannot remain thus, with a sword hanging eternally
NA
NA
NA
â€œListen! You must try to see her, and have an explanation with her. Say
to her: â€˜Peace or war! My word as a gentleman never to say anything of

remain neutral with respect to me. If not, I will apply to the
chancellor, I will apply to the king, I will apply to the hangman, I
will move the courts against you, I will denounce you as branded, I will
bring you to trial; and if you are acquitted, well, by the faith of a
gentleman, I will kill you at the corner of some wall, as I would a mad

NA
NA
â€œTime, dear friend, time brings round opportunity; opportunity is the

And on this assurance, the four friends, who had finished their modest
repast, separated, with the promise of meeting again that evening.
Dâ€™Artagnan returned to less important affairs, and the three Musketeers
repaired to the kingâ€™s quarters, where they had to prepare their
lodging.
43 THE SIGN OF THE RED DOVECOT
Meanwhile the king, who, with more reason than the cardinal, showed his
hatred for Buckingham, although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to
meet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive
the English from the Isle of Re, and afterward to press the siege of La
Rochelle; but notwithstanding his earnest wish, he was delayed by the
dissensions which broke out between MM Bassompierre and Schomberg,
against the Duc dâ€™Angouleme.
MM Bassompierre and Schomberg were marshals of France, and claimed their
right of commanding the army under the orders of the king; but the
cardinal, who feared that Bassompierre, a Huguenot at heart, might press
but feebly the English and Rochellais, his brothers in religion,
supported the Duc dâ€™Angouleme, whom the king, at his instigation, had
named lieutenant general. The result was that to prevent MM Bassompierre
and Schomberg from deserting the army, a separate command had to be
given to each. Bassompierre took up his quarters on the north of the
city, between Leu and Dompierre; the Duc dâ€™Angouleme on the east, from
Dompierre to Perigny; and M. de Schomberg on the south, from Perigny to
Angoutin.
The quarters of Monsieur were at Dompierre; the quarters of the king
were sometimes at Estree, sometimes at Jarrie; the cardinalâ€™s quarters
were upon the downs, at the bridge of La Pierre, in a simple house
without any entrenchment. So that Monsieur watched Bassompierre; the
king, the Duc dâ€™Angouleme; and the cardinal, M. de Schomberg.
As soon as this organization was established, they set about driving the
English from the Isle.
The juncture was favorable. The English, who require, above everything,
good living in order to be good soldiers, only eating salt meat and bad
biscuit, had many invalids in their camp. Still further, the sea, very
rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast, destroyed
every day some little vessel; and the shore, from the point of
lâ€™Aiguillon to the trenches, was at every tide literally covered with
the wrecks of pinnacles, roberges, and feluccas. The result was that
even if the kingâ€™s troops remained quietly in their camp, it was evident
that some day or other, Buckingham, who only continued in the Isle from
obstinacy, would be obliged to raise the siege.
But as M. de Toiras gave information that everything was preparing in
the enemyâ€™s camp for a fresh assault, the king judged that it would be
best to put an end to the affair, and gave the necessary orders for a
decisive action.
As it is not our intention to give a journal of the siege, but on the
contrary only to describe such of the events of it as are connected with
the story we are relating, we will content ourselves with saying in two
words that the expedition succeeded, to the great astonishment of the
king and the great glory of the cardinal. The English, repulsed foot by
foot, beaten in all encounters, and defeated in the passage of the Isle
of Loie, were obliged to re-embark, leaving on the field of battle two
thousand men, among whom were five colonels, three lieutenant colonels,
two hundred and fifty captains, twenty gentlemen of rank, four pieces of
cannon, and sixty flags, which were taken to Paris by Claude de St.
Simon, and suspended with great pomp in the arches of Notre Dame.
Te Deums were chanted in camp, and afterward throughout France.
The cardinal was left free to carry on the siege, without having, at
least at the present, anything to fear on the part of the English.
But it must be acknowledged, this response was but momentary. An envoy
of the Duke of Buckingham, named Montague, was taken, and proof was
obtained of a league between the German Empire, Spain, England, and
Lorraine. This league was directed against France.
Still further, in Buckinghamâ€™s lodging, which he had been forced to
abandon more precipitately than he expected, papers were found which
confirmed this alliance and which, as the cardinal asserts in his
memoirs, strongly compromised Mme. de Chevreuse and consequently the
queen.
It was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell, for one is
not a despotic minister without responsibility. All, therefore, of the
vast resources of his genius were at work night and day, engaged in
listening to the least report heard in any of the great kingdoms of
Europe.
The cardinal was acquainted with the activity, and more particularly the
hatred, of Buckingham. If the league which threatened France triumphed,
all his influence would be lost. Spanish policy and Austrian policy
would have their representatives in the cabinet of the Louvre, where
they had as yet but partisans; and he, Richelieu--the French minister,
the national minister--would be ruined. The king, even while obeying him
like a child, hated him as a child hates his master, and would abandon
him to the personal vengeance of Monsieur and the queen. He would then
be lost, and France, perhaps, with him. All this must be prepared
against.
Courtiers, becoming every instant more numerous, succeeded one another,
day and night, in the little house of the bridge of La Pierre, in which
the cardinal had established his residence.
There were monks who wore the frock with such an ill grace that it was
easy to perceive they belonged to the church militant; women a little
inconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could
not entirely conceal their rounded forms; and peasants with blackened
hands but with fine limbs, savoring of the man of quality a league off.
There were also less agreeable visits--for two or three times reports
were spread that the cardinal had nearly been assassinated.
It is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself
who set these bungling assassins to work, in order to have, if wanted,
the right of using reprisals; but we must not believe everything
ministers say, nor everything their enemies say.
These attempts did not prevent the cardinal, to whom his most inveterate
detractors have never denied personal bravery, from making nocturnal
excursions, sometimes to communicate to the Duc dâ€™Angouleme important
orders, sometimes to confer with the king, and sometimes to have an
interview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home.
On their part the Musketeers, who had not much to do with the siege,
were not under very strict orders and led a joyous life. This was the
more easy for our three companions in particular; for being friends of
M. de Treville, they obtained from him special permission to be absent
after the closing of the camp.
Now, one evening when dâ€™Artagnan, who was in the trenches, was not able
to accompany them, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, mounted on their battle
steeds, enveloped in their war cloaks, with their hands upon their
pistol butts, were returning from a drinking place called the Red
Dovecot, which Athos had discovered two days before upon the route to
Jarrie, following the road which led to the camp and quite on their
guard, as we have stated, for fear of an ambuscade, when, about a
quarter of a league from the village of Boisnau, they fancied they heard
the sound of horses approaching them. They immediately all three halted,
closed in, and waited, occupying the middle of the road. In an instant,
and as the moon broke from behind a cloud, they saw at a turning of the
road two horsemen who, on perceiving them, stopped in their turn,
appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go
back. The hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends, and
Athos, advancing a few paces in front of the others, cried in a firm

NA

NA
NA
seemed accustomed to command.

NA
NA
interrogated them had the right to do so.
NA
NA
NA
The three companions advanced rather humbly--for all were now convinced
that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselves--leaving
Athos the post of speaker.
One of the two riders, he who had spoken second, was ten paces in front
of his companion. Athos made a sign to Porthos and Aramis also to remain
in the rear, and advanced alone.

The cardinal made a sign to his attendant, who drew near. â€œThese three

The cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker.

but for my security. Your companions are no doubt Messieurs Porthos and

NA
remained behind advanced hat in hand.
NA
not quite my friends, and I am sorry you are not so; but I know you are
brave and loyal gentlemen, and that confidence may be placed in you.
Monsieur Athos, do me, then, the honor to accompany me; you and your two
friends, and then I shall have an escort to excite envy in his Majesty,

The three Musketeers bowed to the necks of their horses.

NA
NA
â€œAnd that is the reason why I have the honor to inform your Eminence of
what has happened; for you might learn it from others, and upon a false

â€œMy friend, Aramis, here, has received a slight sword wound in the arm,
but not enough to prevent him, as your Eminence may see, from mounting
NA
â€œBut you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you

accounts with somebody! Confess; you know I have the right of giving
NA
NA
him who offended me round the body, and threw him out of the window. It

NA

and gave one of those brigands such a blow that I believe his shoulder
NA
NA
â€œMonseigneur, being of a very mild disposition, and being, likewise, of
which Monseigneur perhaps is not aware, about to enter into orders, I
endeavored to appease my comrades, when one of these wretches gave me a
wound with a sword, treacherously, across my left arm. Then I admit my
patience failed me; I drew my sword in my turn, and as he came back to
the charge, I fancied I felt that in throwing himself upon me, he let it
pass through his body. I only know for a certainty that he fell; and it

NA
NA
â€œTherefore I do not doubt what you say, Monsieur Athos, I do not doubt
NA
NA
NA
notwithstanding the noise, this cavalier did not show himself, it is to
NA
NA
Athos bowed.
NA
NA
The three Musketeers passed behind his Eminence, who again enveloped his
face in his cloak, and put his horse in motion, keeping from eight to
ten paces in advance of his four companions.
They soon arrived at the silent, solitary inn. No doubt the host knew
what illustrious visitor was expected, and had consequently sent
intruders out of the way.
Ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the
three Musketeers to halt. A saddled horse was fastened to the window
shutter. The cardinal knocked three times, and in a peculiar manner.
A man, enveloped in a cloak, came out immediately, and exchanged some
rapid words with the cardinal; after which he mounted his horse, and set
off in the direction of Surgeres, which was likewise the way to Paris.
NA
NA
Musketeers, â€œand it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening
NA
The cardinal alighted; the three Musketeers did likewise. The cardinal
threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire; the three Musketeers
fastened the horses to the shutters.
The host stood at the door. For him, the cardinal was only an officer
coming to visit a lady.
â€œHave you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait
NA
The host opened the door of a large room, in which an old stove had just
been replaced by a large and excellent chimney.
NA
NA
NA
And while the three Musketeers entered the ground floor room, the
cardinal, without asking further information, ascended the staircase
like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him.
44 THE UTILITY OF STOVEPIPES
It was evident that without suspecting it, and actuated solely by their
chivalrous and adventurous character, our three friends had just
rendered a service to someone the cardinal honored with his special
protection.
Now, who was that someone? That was the question the three Musketeers
put to one another. Then, seeing that none of their replies could throw
any light on the subject, Porthos called the host and asked for dice.
Porthos and Aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play.
Athos walked about in a contemplative mood.
While thinking and walking, Athos passed and repassed before the pipe of
the stove, broken in halves, the other extremity passing into the
chamber above; and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur
of words, which at length fixed his attention. Athos went close to it,
and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest
that he made a sign to his friends to be silent, remaining himself bent
with his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice.
NA
NA
NA

voice which made the Musketeer start.
â€œA small vessel with an English crew, whose captain is on my side,

    _*Fort La Pointe, or Fort Vasou, was not built until 1672,

â€œInstantly! That is to say, when you have received my instructions. Two
men, whom you will find at the door on going out, will serve you as
escort. You will allow me to leave first; then, after half an hour, you
NA
â€œYes, monseigneur. Now let us return to the mission with which you wish
to charge me; and as I desire to continue to merit the confidence of
your Eminence, deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise, that

There was an instant of profound silence between the two interlocutors.
It was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in
which he was about to speak, and that Milady was collecting all her
intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say, and
to engrave them in her memory when they should be spoken.
Athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten
the door inside, and to make them a sign to come and listen with him.
The two Musketeers, who loved their ease, brought a chair for each of
themselves and one for Athos. All three then sat down with their heads
together and their ears on the alert.

black tears, deathâ€™s heads, and crossbones--for in case of a surprise,
he was to pass for the phantom of the White Lady who, as all the world

really is--that is, to announce to his Grace, on the part of your
Eminence, that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means
of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fete given by
Madame the Constable; that you have proofs of the interview granted at
the Louvre by the queen to a certain Italian astrologer who was no other
than the Duke of Buckingham; that you have ordered a little romance of a
satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of Amiens, with a
plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place, and portraits
of the actors who figured in them; that Montague is in the Bastille, and
that the torture may make him say things he remembers, and even things
he has forgotten; that you possess a certain letter from Madame de

not only her who wrote it, but her in whose name it was written. Then,

the limit of my mission--I shall have nothing to do but to pray God to
work a miracle for the salvation of France. That is it, is it not,

NA
NA
NA
NA
anger. â€œHe is the evil genius of both of us. It is he who in an
encounter with your Eminenceâ€™s Guards decided the victory in favor of
the kingâ€™s Musketeers; it is he who gave three desperate wounds to de
Wardes, your emissary, and who caused the affair of the diamond studs to
fail; it is he who, knowing it was I who had Madame Bonacieux carried

NA
NA

a creature--the more so as you tell me this dâ€™Artagnan is a libertine, a

NA
NA
NA
There was a moment of silence, which proved that the cardinal was
employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note, or else
in writing it. Athos, who had not lost a word of the conversation, took
his two companions by the hand, and led them to the other end of the
room.

NA
NA
necessary we should hear; besides, I donâ€™t prevent you from listening,
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou will not wait till he asks; you will speak first, and tell him that
I am gone on the lookout, because certain expressions of our host have
given me reason to think the road is not safe. I will say two words
about it to the cardinalâ€™s esquire likewise. The rest concerns myself;
NA
NA
NA
Porthos and Aramis resumed their places by the stovepipe.
As to Athos, he went out without any mystery, took his horse, which was
tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters, in
four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for
their return, carefully examined the priming of his pistols, drew his
sword, and took, like a forlorn hope, the road to the camp.
45 A CONJUGAL SCENE
As Athos had foreseen, it was not long before the cardinal came down. He
opened the door of the room in which the Musketeers were, and found
Porthos playing an earnest game of dice with Aramis. He cast a rapid
glance around the room, and perceived that one of his men was missing.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The attendant was at the door, holding the cardinalâ€™s horse by the
bridle. At a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared
in the shade. These were the two men who were to conduct Milady to Fort
La Pointe, and superintend her embarkation.
The attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two Musketeers had
already said with respect to Athos. The cardinal made an approving
gesture, and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used
incoming.
Let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire
and the two Musketeers, and return to Athos.
For a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started; but
when out of sight he turned his horse to the right, made a circuit, and
came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of
the little troop. Having recognized the laced hats of his companions and
the golden fringe of the cardinalâ€™s cloak, he waited till the horsemen
had turned the angle of the road, and having lost sight of them, he
returned at a gallop to the inn, which was opened to him without
hesitation.
The host recognized him.
NA
important information to the lady, and has sent me back to repair his
NA
NA
Athos availed himself of the permission, ascended the stairs with his
lightest step, gained the landing, and through the open door perceived
Milady putting on her hat.
He entered the chamber and closed the door behind him. At the noise he
made in pushing the bolt, Milady turned round.
Athos was standing before the door, enveloped in his cloak, with his hat
pulled down over his eyes. On seeing this figure, mute and immovable as
a statue, Milady was frightened.
NA
NA
And letting fall his cloak and raising his hat, he advanced toward
Milady.
NA
Milady made one step forward, and then drew back as if she had seen a
serpent.
NA
NA
drawing back till the wall prevented her from going any farther.
NA

Milady, under the influence of inexpressible terror, sat down without
uttering a word.

often conquered the most terrible demons. You have once before thrown
yourself in my path. I thought I had crushed you, madame; but either I

Milady at these words, which recalled frightful remembrances, hung down
her head with a suppressed groan.
NA
rich, hell has given you another name, hell has almost made you another
face; but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the brand
NA
Milady arose as if moved by a powerful spring, and her eyes flashed
lightning. Athos remained sitting.
â€œYou believed me to be dead, did you not, as I believed you to be? And
the name of Athos as well concealed the Comte de la Fere, as the name
Milady Clarik concealed Anne de Breuil. Was it not so you were called
when your honored brother married us? Our position is truly a strange
NA
time because we believed each other dead, and because a remembrance is
less oppressive than a living creature, though a remembrance is
NA
NA
NA
â€œI wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes, I have
NA
NA
â€œI can relate to you, day by day, your actions from your entrance to the

A smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of Milady.
â€œListen! It was you who cut off the two diamond studs from the shoulder
of the Duke of Buckingham; it was you had the Madame Bonacieux carried
off; it was you who, in love with de Wardes and thinking to pass the
night with him, opened the door to Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan; it was you who,
believing that de Wardes had deceived you, wished to have him killed by
his rival; it was you who, when this rival had discovered your infamous
secret, wished to have him killed in his turn by two assassins, whom you
sent in pursuit of him; it was you who, finding the balls had missed
their mark, sent poisoned wine with a forged letter, to make your victim
believe that the wine came from his friends. In short, it was you who
have but now in this chamber, seated in this chair I now fill, made an
engagement with Cardinal Richelieu to cause the Duke of Buckingham to be
assassinated, in exchange for the promise he has made you to allow you
NA
Milady was livid.
NA
NA
Assassinate the Duke of Buckingham, or cause him to be assassinated--I
care very little about that! I donâ€™t know him. Besides, he is an
Englishman. But do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair
of dâ€™Artagnan, who is a faithful friend whom I love and defend, or I
swear to you by the head of my father the crime which you shall have
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Athos was seized with a kind of vertigo. The sight of this creature, who
had nothing of the woman about her, recalled awful remembrances. He
thought how one day, in a less dangerous situation than the one in which
he was now placed, he had already endeavored to sacrifice her to his
honor. His desire for blood returned, burning his brain and pervading
his frame like a raging fever; he arose in his turn, reached his hand to
his belt, drew forth a pistol, and cocked it.
Milady, pale as a corpse, endeavored to cry out; but her swollen tongue
could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it
and resembled the rattle of a wild beast. Motionless against the dark
tapestry, with her hair in disorder, she appeared like a horrid image of
terror.
Athos slowly raised his pistol, stretched out his arm so that the weapon
almost touched Miladyâ€™s forehead, and then, in a voice the more terrible
NA
he, â€œyou will this instant deliver to me the paper the cardinal signed;
NA
With another man, Milady might have preserved some doubt; but she knew
Athos. Nevertheless, she remained motionless.
NA
Milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was
about to be pulled; she reached her hand quickly to her bosom, drew out
a paper, and held it toward Athos.
NA
Athos took the paper, returned the pistol to his belt, approached the
lamp to be assured that it was the paper, unfolded it, and read:
â€œDec. 3, 1627
â€œIt is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this
has done what he has done.
NA
NA
NA
And he left the chamber without once looking behind him.
At the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they held.
NA
woman, without losing time, to Fort La Pointe, and never to leave her
NA
As these words agreed wholly with the order they had received, they
bowed their heads in sign of assent.
With regard to Athos, he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at
full gallop; only instead of following the road, he went across the
fields, urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to
listen.
In one of those halts he heard the steps of several horses on the road.
He had no doubt it was the cardinal and his escort. He immediately made
a new point in advance, rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves
of trees, and placed himself across the road, about two hundred paces
from the camp.
NA
NA
NA
NA
you have kept. Gentlemen, we are arrived; take the gate on the left. The
NA
Saying these words, the cardinal saluted the three friends with an
inclination of his head, and took the right hand, followed by his
attendant--for that night he himself slept in the camp.
NA
NA
NA
And the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached
their quarters, except to give the watchword to the sentinels. Only they
sent Mousqueton to tell Planchet that his master was requested, the
instant that he left the trenches, to come to the quarters of the
Musketeers.
Milady, as Athos had foreseen, on finding the two men that awaited her,
made no difficulty in following them. She had had for an instant an
inclination to be reconducted to the cardinal, and relate everything to
him; but a revelation on her part would bring about a revelation on the
part of Athos. She might say that Athos had hanged her; but then Athos
would tell that she was branded. She thought it was best to preserve
silence, to discreetly set off to accomplish her difficult mission with
her usual skill; and then, all things being accomplished to the
satisfaction of the cardinal, to come to him and claim her vengeance.
In consequence, after having traveled all night, at seven oâ€™clock she
was at the fort of the Point; at eight oâ€™clock she had embarked; and at
nine, the vessel, which with letters of marque from the cardinal was
supposed to be sailing for Bayonne, raised anchor, and steered its
course toward England.
46 THE BASTION SAINT-GERVAIS
On arriving at the lodgings of his three friends, dâ€™Artagnan found them
assembled in the same chamber. Athos was meditating; Porthos was
twisting his mustache; Aramis was saying his prayers in a charming
little Book of Hours, bound in blue velvet.
NA
the trouble, or else, I warn you, I will not pardon you for making me
come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking
and dismantling a bastion. Ah, why were you not there, gentlemen? It was
NA
NA
his mustache a twist which was peculiar to him.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œFor my part, I ate but little. The day before yesterday was a fish day,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhy, I think there were not many intruders. Yes, Athos, I know what you
NA
â€œLet us go to the Parpaillot, then, for here the walls are like sheets
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan, who was accustomed to his friendâ€™s manner of acting, and who
perceived immediately, by a word, a gesture, or a sign from him, that
the circumstances were serious, took Athosâ€™s arm, and went out without
saying anything. Porthos followed, chatting with Aramis.
On their way they met Grimaud. Athos made him a sign to come with them.
Grimaud, according to custom, obeyed in silence; the poor lad had nearly
come to the pass of forgetting how to speak.
They arrived at the drinking room of the Parpaillot. It was seven
oâ€™clock in the morning, and daylight began to appear. The three friends
ordered breakfast, and went into a room in which the host said they
would not be disturbed.
Unfortunately, the hour was badly chosen for a private conference. The
morning drum had just been beaten; everyone shook off the drowsiness of
night, and to dispel the humid morning air, came to take a drop at the
inn. Dragoons, Swiss, Guardsmen, Musketeers, light-horsemen, succeeded
one another with a rapidity which might answer the purpose of the host
very well, but agreed badly with the views of the four friends. Thus
they applied very curtly to the salutations, healths, and jokes of their
companions.
NA
quarrel or other, and we have no need of one just now. Dâ€™Artagnan, tell
us what sort of a night you have had, and we will describe ours
NA
NA
which he sipped slowly. â€œI hear you gentlemen of the Guards have been in
the trenches tonight, and that you did not get much the best of the
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan looked at Athos to know if he ought to reply to this intruder
who thus mixed unasked in their conversation.
NA
the honor to ask you a question? Relate what has passed during the
NA
NA
of a beer glass.
NA
even have, as you may have heard, introduced a barrel of powder under
one of the angles, which in blowing up made a very pretty breach.
Without reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the
NA
NA
goose which he was taking to be cooked.

NA
NA
NA
NA
collection of oaths possessed by the German language, had acquired a
habit of swearing in French.

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA

bit, I am in it. You cursed host! a dripping pan immediately, that I may

NA
NA
NA

go and breakfast in the bastion St. Gervais, and we will remain there an
NA
Porthos and Aramis looked at each other; they began to comprehend.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The fourth auditor, who during all this conversation had played a mute
part, made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the
proposition.
NA
NA
The host obeyed. Athos called Grimaud, pointed to a large basket which
lay in a corner, and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the
napkins.
Grimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass, took the
basket, packed up the viands, added the bottles, and then took the
basket on his arm.
NA
NA
pistoles majestically on the table.
NA
â€œNo, only add two bottles of champagne, and the difference will be for
NA
The host had not quite so good a bargain as he at first hoped for, but
he made amends by slipping in two bottles of Anjou wine instead of two
bottles of champagne.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
And bowing to all the astonished persons present, the young men took the
road to the bastion St. Gervais, followed by Grimaud, who carried the
basket, ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience
which Athos had taught him not even thinking of asking.
As long as they were within the circle of the camp, the four friends did
not exchange one word; besides, they were followed by the curious, who,
hearing of the wager, were anxious to know how they would come out of
it. But when once they passed the line of circumvallation and found
themselves in the open plain, dâ€™Artagnan, who was completely ignorant of
what was going forward, thought it was time to demand an explanation.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œBecause we have very important matters to communicate to one another,
and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being
annoyed by all those importunate fellows, who keep coming in, saluting
NA
NA
NA
itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery, â€œthat we could have
NA
â€œWhere we should have been seen all four conferring together, so that at
the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThere is no desert where a bird cannot pass over oneâ€™s head, where a
fish cannot leap out of the water, where a rabbit cannot come out of its
burrow, and I believe that bird, fish, and rabbit each becomes a spy of
the cardinal. Better, then, pursue our enterprise; from which, besides,
we cannot retreat without shame. We have made a wager--a wager which
could not have been foreseen, and of which I defy anyone to divine the
true cause. We are going, in order to win it, to remain an hour in the
bastion. Either we shall be attacked, or not. If we are not, we shall
have all the time to talk, and nobody will hear us--for I guarantee the
walls of the bastion have no ears; if we are, we will talk of our
affairs just the same. Moreover, in defending ourselves, we shall cover
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œBut for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our
NA
â€œYou are stupid, friend Porthos. Why should we load ourselves with a
NA
â€œI donâ€™t find a good musket, twelve cartridges, and a powder flask very
NA
NA
NA
â€œdâ€™Artagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten Frenchmen
NA
NA
â€œThe bodies were not plundered, were they? It appears the conquerors had
NA
NA
â€œWell, we shall find their muskets, their cartridges, and their flasks;
and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls, we shall have fifteen
NA
NA
Porthos nodded in sign of agreement. Dâ€™Artagnan alone did not seem
convinced.
Grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man, for seeing that
they continued to advance toward the bastion--something he had till then
doubted--he pulled his master by the skirt of his coat.
NA
Athos pointed to the bastion.
NA
NA
Athos raised his eyes and his finger toward heaven.
Grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the
head.
Athos took a pistol from his belt, looked to see if it was properly
primed, cocked it, and placed the muzzle close to Grimaudâ€™s ear.
Grimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring. Athos then made him a
sign to take up his basket and to walk on first. Grimaud obeyed. All
that Grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the
rear guard to the vanguard.
Arrived at the bastion, the four friends turned round.
More than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the gate
of the camp; and in a separate group might be distinguished M. de
Busigny, the dragoon, the Swiss, and the fourth bettor.
Athos took off his hat, placed it on the end of his sword, and waved it
in the air.
All the spectators returned him his salute, accompanying this courtesy
with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four; after which all four
disappeared in the bastion, whither Grimaud had preceded them.
47 THE COUNCIL OF THE MUSKETEERS
As Athos had foreseen, the bastion was only occupied by a dozen corpses,
French and Rochellais.
NA
â€œwhile Grimaud spreads the table, let us begin by collecting the guns
and cartridges together. We can talk while performing that necessary
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The four Musketeers went to work; and as they were loading the last
musket Grimaud announced that the breakfast was ready.
Athos replied, always by gestures, that that was well, and indicated to
Grimaud, by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster, that he
was to stand as sentinel. Only, to alleviate the tediousness of the
duty, Athos allowed him to take a loaf, two cutlets, and a bottle of
wine.
NA
The four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed
like Turks, or even tailors.
NA
NA
NA
said Athos. â€œI have induced you to take a charming promenade; here is a
delicious breakfast; and yonder are five hundred persons, as you may see
through the loopholes, taking us for heroes or madmen--two classes of

NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan was lifting a glass to his lips; but at the name of Milady,
his hand trembled so, that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground

NA
NA

NA

NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan breathed again.
NA
NA
NA
NA
charming woman, who entertained kind views toward our friend dâ€™Artagnan,
who, on his part, has given her some offense for which she tried to
revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots, a
week ago by trying to poison him, and yesterday by demanding his head of
NA
NA
with terror.
NA
NA
NA
NA
is useless to struggle longer. I may as well blow my brains out, and all
NA
NA
NA
NA
stranger of Meung; then de Wardes, to whom I have given three sword
wounds; next Milady, whose secret I have discovered; finally, the
NA
NA
Pardieu! if we may believe the signs Grimaud is making, we are about to
have to do with a very different number of people. What is it, Grimaud?
Considering the gravity of the occasion, I permit you to speak, my
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œGood! We have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of
NA
NA
â€œWell, then, to my health! although I am very much afraid that your good
NA
NA
NA
Then, swallowing the contents of his glass, which he put down close to
him, Athos arose carelessly, took the musket next to him, and drew near
to one of the loopholes.
Porthos, Aramis and dâ€™Artagnan followed his example. As to Grimaud, he
received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to
reload their weapons.
NA
ourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes, mattocks, and shovels.
Grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away, and I am convinced they
NA
NA
resolutely. Besides, in addition to the pioneers, there are four
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
But Athos heeded not his advice. Mounting on the breach, with his musket
in one hand and his hat in the other, he said, bowing courteously and
addressing the soldiers and the pioneers, who, astonished at this
apparition, stopped fifty paces from the bastion: â€œGentlemen, a few
friends and myself are about to breakfast in this bastion. Now, you know
nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at
breakfast. We request you, then, if you really have business here, to
wait till we have finished our repast, or to come again a short time
hence; unless, which would be far better, you form the salutary
resolution to quit the side of the rebels, and come and drink with us to
NA
NA
NA
NA
In fact, at the same instant four shots were fired, and the balls were
flattened against the wall around Athos, but not one touched him.
Four shots replied to them almost instantaneously, but much better aimed
than those of the aggressors; three soldiers fell dead, and one of the
pioneers was wounded.
NA
Grimaud immediately obeyed. On their part, the three friends had
reloaded their arms; a second discharge followed the first. The
brigadier and two pioneers fell dead; the rest of the troop took to
flight.
NA
And the four friends rushed out of the fort, gained the field of battle,
picked up the four muskets of the privates and the half-pike of the
brigadier, and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till they
reached the city, turned again toward the bastion, bearing with them the
trophies of their victory.
NA
NA
NA
demanded my head of the cardinal, Milady had quit the shores of France.
NA
followed.
NA
NA
â€œWith the view of assassinating, or causing to be assassinated, the Duke
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation.
NA
NA
about it. Now you have done, Grimaud, take our brigadierâ€™s half-pike,
tie a napkin to it, and plant it on top of our bastion, that these
rebels of Rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and loyal
NA
Grimaud obeyed without replying. An instant afterward, the white flag
was floating over the heads of the four friends. A thunder of applause
saluted its appearance; half the camp was at the barrier.
NA
NA
â€œThe duke is English; the duke fights against us. Let her do what she
NA
Athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had
poured the last drop into his glass.
NA
NA
NA
wore on his cloak the lace of his own.
NA
NA
NA
be your pleasure; but what for the moment engaged my attention most
earnestly, and I am sure you will understand me, dâ€™Artagnan, was the
getting from this woman a kind of carte blanche which she had extorted
from the cardinal, and by means of which she could with impunity get rid
NA
NA
to Aramis, who was cutting up a fowl.
NA
NA
â€œNo, it passed into mine; I will not say without trouble, for if I did I

â€œMy dear Athos, I shall no longer count the number of times I am

pocket of his uniform. Dâ€™Artagnan unfolded it with one hand, whose
trembling he did not even attempt to conceal, to read:
â€œDec. 3, 1627
â€œIt is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this
has done what he has done.
NA
NA
NA
read in it his sentence of death.
NA
NA
NA
NA
cardinal that a damned Musketeer, named Athos, has taken her
safe-conduct from her by force; she will advise him in the same letter
to get rid of his two friends, Aramis and Porthos, at the same time. The
cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often
crossed his path; and then some fine morning he will arrest dâ€™Artagnan,
and for fear he should feel lonely, he will send us to keep him company
NA
NA
NA
NA
would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of
Huguenots, who have committed no other crime than singing in French the
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œBut when you held her in your power, why did you not drown her,
NA
NA
NA
dâ€™Artagnan alone understood.
NA
NA
NA
The young men sprang up, and seized their muskets.
This time a small troop advanced, consisting of from twenty to
twenty-five men; but they were not pioneers, they were soldiers of the
garrison.
NA
NA
NA
not finished breakfast; the second, that we still have some very
important things to say; and the third, that it yet wants ten minutes

NA
NA
musket shot, we must fire upon them. If they continue to advance, we
must fire again. We must fire as long as we have loaded guns. If those
who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault, we will allow
the besiegers to get as far as the ditch, and then we will push down
upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a
NA
NA
general, and the cardinal, who fancies himself a great soldier, is
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The four muskets made but one report, but four men fell.
The drum immediately beat, and the little troop advanced at charging
pace.
Then the shots were repeated without regularity, but always aimed with
the same accuracy. Nevertheless, as if they had been aware of the
numerical weakness of the friends, the Rochellais continued to advance
in quick time.
With every three shots at least two men fell; but the march of those who
remained was not slackened.
Arrived at the foot of the bastion, there were still more than a dozen
of the enemy. A last discharge welcomed them, but did not stop them;
they jumped into the ditch, and prepared to scale the breach.
NA
NA
And the four friends, seconded by Grimaud, pushed with the barrels of
their muskets an enormous sheet of the wall, which bent as if pushed by
the wind, and detaching itself from its base, fell with a horrible crash
into the ditch. Then a fearful crash was heard; a cloud of dust mounted
toward the sky--and all was over!
NA
Athos.
NA
NA
In fact, three or four of these unfortunate men, covered with dirt and
blood, fled along the hollow way, and at length regained the city. These
were all who were left of the little troop.

The four friends looked at one another, and a cloud came over the brows
which but lately had been so cheerful.

NA

Grimaud made a sign in the affirmative, and pointed to a dozen bodies
which he had set up in the most picturesque attitudes. Some carried
arms, others seemed to be taking aim, and the remainder appeared merely
to be sword in hand.

Grimaud was already ahead, with the basket and the dessert. The four
friends followed, ten paces behind him.

And Athos ran back to the bastion, mounted the platform, and bore off
the flag; but as the Rochellais had arrived within musket range, they
opened a terrible fire upon this man, who appeared to expose himself for
pleasureâ€™s sake.
But Athos might be said to bear a charmed life. The balls passed and
whistled all around him; not one struck him.
Athos waved his flag, turning his back on the guards of the city, and
saluting those of the camp. On both sides loud cries arose--on the one
side cries of anger, on the other cries of enthusiasm.
A second discharge followed the first, and three balls, by passing
through it, made the napkin really a flag. Cries were heard from the

Athos came down; his friends, who anxiously awaited him, saw him
returned with joy.
NA
NA
But Athos continued to march majestically, whatever remarks his
companions made; and they, finding their remarks useless, regulated
their pace by his.
Grimaud and his basket were far in advance, out of the range of the
balls.
At the end of an instant they heard a furious fusillade.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œCertainly not! They will then fancy it is an ambuscade, they will
deliberate; and by the time they have found out the pleasantry, we shall
be out of the range of their balls. That renders it useless to get a

NA
On their part, the French, on seeing the four friends return at such a
step, uttered cries of enthusiasm.
At length a fresh discharge was heard, and this time the balls came
rattling among the stones around the four friends, and whistling sharply
in their ears. The Rochellais had at last taken possession of the
bastion.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAnd in exchange for all that not even a scratch! Ah, but what is the

The fusillade continued; but the four friends were out of reach, and the
Rochellais only fired to appease their consciences.

at the camp; therefore, gentlemen, not a word more of this affair. We
are observed; they are coming to meet us. We shall be carried in

In fact, as we have said, the whole camp was in motion. More than two
thousand persons had assisted, as at a spectacle, in this fortunate but
wild undertaking of the four friends--an undertaking of which they were
far from suspecting the real motive. Nothing was heard but cries of
NA
come and shake Athos by the hand, and acknowledge that the wager was
lost. The dragoon and the Swiss followed him, and all their comrades
followed the dragoon and the Swiss. There was nothing but felicitations,
pressures of the hand, and embraces; there was no end to the
inextinguishable laughter at the Rochellais. The tumult at length became
so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot, and sent La
Houdiniere, his captain of the Guards, to inquire what was going on.
The affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of
enthusiasm.

The same evening the cardinal spoke to M. de Treville of the exploit of

of it, related it in all its details to his Eminence, not forgetting the
episode of the napkin.

That same evening M. de Treville announced this good news to the three
Musketeers and dâ€™Artagnan, inviting all four to breakfast with him next
morning.
Dâ€™Artagnan was beside himself with joy. We know that the dream of his
life had been to become a Musketeer. The three friends were likewise
greatly delighted.

That evening dâ€™Artagnan went to present his respects to M. Dessessart,
and inform him of his promotion.
M Dessessart, who esteemed dâ€™Artagnan, made him offers of help, as this
change would entail expenses for equipment.
Dâ€™Artagnan refused; but thinking the opportunity a good one, he begged
him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued, as he wished to
turn it into money.
The next day, M. Dessessartâ€™s valet came to dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s lodging, and
gave him a bag containing seven thousand livres.
This was the price of the queenâ€™s diamond.
48 A FAMILY AFFAIR
Athos had invented the phrase, family affair. A family affair was not
subject to the investigation of the cardinal; a family affair concerned
nobody. People might employ themselves in a family affair before all the
world. Therefore Athos had invented the phrase, family affair.
Aramis had discovered the idea, the lackeys.
Porthos had discovered the means, the diamond.
Dâ€™Artagnan alone had discovered nothing--he, ordinarily the most
inventive of the four; but it must be also said that the very name of
Milady paralyzed him.
Ah! no, we were mistaken; he had discovered a purchaser for his diamond.
The breakfast at M. de Trevilleâ€™s was as gay and cheerful as possible.
Dâ€™Artagnan already wore his uniform--for being nearly of the same size
as Aramis, and as Aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who
purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double, he sold his
friend a complete outfit.
Dâ€™Artagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not
constantly seen Milady like a dark cloud hovering in the horizon.
After breakfast, it was agreed that they should meet again in the
evening at Athosâ€™s lodging, and there finish their plans.
Dâ€™Artagnan passed the day in exhibiting his Musketeerâ€™s uniform in every
street of the camp.
In the evening, at the appointed hour, the four friends met. There only
remained three things to decide--what they should write to Miladyâ€™s
brother; what they should write to the clever person at Tours; and which
should be the lackeys to carry the letters.
Everyone offered his own. Athos talked of the discretion of Grimaud, who
never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his mouth. Porthos
boasted of the strength of Mousqueton, who was big enough to thrash four
men of ordinary size. Aramis, confiding in the address of Bazin, made a
pompous eulogium on his candidate. Finally, dâ€™Artagnan had entire faith
in the bravery of Planchet, and reminded them of the manner in which he
had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of Boulogne.
These four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time, and gave
birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they
should be deemed too long.

will put it out of her power to injure us. I will write to him, then,

hussy. I have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with

NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan and Athos looked at each other for some time in silence. At
length Athos, after serious reflection and becoming more pale than
usual, made a sign of assent to dâ€™Artagnan, who by it understood he was
at liberty to speak.
NA
sister-in-law is an infamous woman, who wished to have you killed that
she might inherit your wealth; but she could not marry your brother,
NA
as if seeking for the word, and looked at Athos.

cried Porthos.

These three yeses had been pronounced by Athos, each with a sadder
intonation.

Aramis accordingly took the quill, reflected for a few moments, wrote
eight or ten lines in a charming little female hand, and then with a
voice soft and slow, as if each word had been scrupulously weighed, he
read the following:
â€œMy Lord, The person who writes these few lines had the honor of
crossing swords with you in the little enclosure of the Rue dâ€™Enfer. As
you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that
person, he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending
you important information. Twice you have nearly been the victim of a
near relative, whom you believe to be your heir because you are ignorant
that before she contracted a marriage in England she was already married
in France. But the third time, which is the present, you may succumb.
Your relative left La Rochelle for England during the night. Watch her
arrival, for she has great and terrible projects. If you require to know
positively what she is capable of, read her past history on her left

NA
you have the pen of a secretary of state. Lord de Winter will now be
upon his guard if the letter should reach him; and even if it should
fall into the hands of the cardinal, we shall not be compromised. But as
the lackey who goes may make us believe he has been to London and may
stop at Chatellerault, let us give him only half the sum promised him,
with the letter, with an agreement that he shall have the other half in
NA

and Porthos started. As to Athos, he remained unmoved.

Aramis resumed his pen, reflected a little, and wrote the following
lines, which he immediately submitted to the approbation of his friends.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Aramis continued:
â€œMy dear Cousin, His Eminence, the cardinal, whom God preserve for the
happiness of France and the confusion of the enemies of the kingdom, is
on the point of putting an end to the hectic rebellion of La Rochelle.
It is probable that the succor of the English fleet will never even
arrive in sight of the place. I will even venture to say that I am
certain M. de Buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some
great event. His Eminence is the most illustrious politician of times
past, of times present, and probably of times to come. He would
extinguish the sun if the sun incommoded him. Give these happy tidings
to your sister, my dear cousin. I have dreamed that the unlucky
Englishman was dead. I cannot recollect whether it was by steel or by
poison; only of this I am sure, I have dreamed he was dead, and you know

He folded the letter fancifully, and took up his pen and wrote:
NA
The three friends looked at one another and laughed; they were caught.

Bazin alone can carry this letter to Tours. My cousin knows nobody but
Bazin, and places confidence in nobody but him; any other person would
fail. Besides, Bazin is ambitious and learned; Bazin has read history,
gentlemen, he knows that Sixtus the Fifth became Pope after having kept
pigs. Well, as he means to enter the Church at the same time as myself,
he does not despair of becoming Pope in his turn, or at least a
cardinal. You can understand that a man who has such views will never
allow himself to be taken, or if taken, will undergo martyrdom rather
NA
NA
grant me Planchet. Milady had him one day turned out of doors, with
sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions. Now, Planchet
has an excellent memory; and I will be bound that sooner than relinquish
any possible means of vengeance, he will allow himself to be beaten to
death. If your arrangements at Tours are your arrangements, Aramis,
those of London are mine. I request, then, that Planchet may be chosen,
more particularly as he has already been to London with me, and knows
how to speak correctly: London, sir, if you please, and my master, Lord
dâ€™Artagnan. With that you may be satisfied he can make his way, both
NA
NA
for going, and seven hundred livres for coming back; and Bazin, three
hundred livres for going, and three hundred livres for returning--that
will reduce the sum to five thousand livres. We will each take a
thousand livres to be employed as seems good, and we will leave a fund
of a thousand livres under the guardianship of Monsieur Abbe here, for

â€œYou will give me a copy this evening, which I shall know by heart

Dâ€™Artagnan looked at his friends, as if to say, â€œWell, what did I tell

sixteen days. If, on the sixteenth day after your departure, at eight
oâ€™clock in the evening you are not here, no money--even if it be but

you get drunk, you risk your masterâ€™s head, who has so much confidence

so closely united.

It was decided that Planchet should set out the next day, at eight
oâ€™clock in the morning, in order, as he had said, that he might during
the night learn the letter by heart. He gained just twelve hours by this
engagement; he was to be back on the sixteenth day, by eight oâ€™clock in
the evening.
In the morning, as he was mounting his horse, dâ€™Artagnan, who felt at
the bottom of his heart a partiality for the duke, took Planchet aside.
NA
Winter and he has read it, you will further say to him: Watch over his
Grace Lord Buckingham, for they wish to assassinate him. But this,
Planchet, is so serious and important that I have not informed my
friends that I would entrust this secret to you; and for a captainâ€™s
NA
NA
NA
Mounted on an excellent horse, which he was to leave at the end of
twenty leagues in order to take the post, Planchet set off at a gallop,
his spirits a little depressed by the triple promise made him by the
Musketeers, but otherwise as light-hearted as possible.
Bazin set out the next day for Tours, and was allowed eight days for
performing his commission.
The four friends, during the period of these two absences, had, as may
well be supposed, the eye on the watch, the nose to the wind, and the
ear on the hark. Their days were passed in endeavoring to catch all that
was said, in observing the proceeding of the cardinal, and in looking
out for all the couriers who arrived. More than once an involuntary
trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected service. They
had, besides, to look constantly to their own proper safety; Milady was
a phantom which, when it had once appeared to people, did not allow them
to sleep very quietly.
On the morning of the eighth day, Bazin, fresh as ever, and smiling,
according to custom, entered the cabaret of the Parpaillot as the four
friends were sitting down to breakfast, saying, as had been agreed upon:

The four friends exchanged a joyful glance; half of the work was done.
It is true, however, that it was the shorter and easier part.

NA

Aramis read the letter, and passed it to Athos.
NA
Athos cast a glance over the epistle, and to disperse all the suspicions
that might have been created, read aloud:
â€œMy cousin,
â€œMy sister and I are skillful in interpreting dreams, and even entertain
great fear of them; but of yours it may be said, I hope, every dream is
an illusion. Adieu! Take care of yourself, and act so that we may from
time to time hear you spoken of.
NA
NA
during the reading.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan, seeing Athos rise, did likewise, took his arm, and went out.
Porthos and Aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon
and the Swiss.
As to Bazin, he went and lay down on a truss of straw; and as he had
more imagination than the Swiss, he dreamed that Aramis, having become
pope, adorned his head with a cardinalâ€™s hat.
But, as we have said, Bazin had not, by his fortunate return, removed
more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends.
The days of expectation are long, and dâ€™Artagnan, in particular, would
have wagered that the days were forty-four hours. He forgot the
necessary slowness of navigation; he exaggerated to himself the power of
Milady. He credited this woman, who appeared to him the equal of a
demon, with agents as supernatural as herself; at the least noise, he
imagined himself about to be arrested, and that Planchet was being
brought back to be confronted with himself and his friends. Still
further, his confidence in the worthy Picard, at one time so great,
diminished day by day. This anxiety became so great that it even
extended to Aramis and Porthos. Athos alone remained unmoved, as if no
danger hovered over him, and as if he breathed his customary atmosphere.
On the sixteenth day, in particular, these signs were so strong in
dâ€™Artagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one
place, and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which Planchet was
expected.
NA
woman terrify you so! And what does it amount to, after all? To be
imprisoned. Well, but we should be taken out of prison; Madame Bonacieux
was released. To be decapitated? Why, every day in the trenches we go
cheerfully to expose ourselves to worse than that--for a bullet may
break a leg, and I am convinced a surgeon would give us more pain in
cutting off a thigh than an executioner in cutting off a head. Wait
quietly, then; in two hours, in four, in six hours at latest, Planchet
will be here. He promised to be here, and I have very great faith in
NA
NA
â€œWell, if he does not come, it will be because he has been delayed,
thatâ€™s all. He may have fallen from his horse, he may have cut a caper
from the deck; he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to have
brought on a violent catarrh. Eh, gentlemen, let us reckon upon
accidents! Life is a chaplet of little miseries which the philosopher
counts with a smile. Be philosophers, as I am, gentlemen; sit down at
the table and let us drink. Nothing makes the future look so bright as

Athos started, passed his hand over his brow to remove the drops of
perspiration that burst forth, and rose in his turn with a nervous
movement he could not repress.
The day, however, passed away; and the evening came on slowly, but
finally it came. The bars were filled with drinkers. Athos, who had
pocketed his share of the diamond, seldom quit the Parpaillot. He had
found in M. de Busigny, who, by the by, had given them a magnificent
dinner, a partner worthy of his company. They were playing together, as
usual, when seven oâ€™clock sounded; the patrol was heard passing to
double the posts. At half past seven the retreat was sounded.
NA
NA
pistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the table. â€œCome,

And Athos went out of the Parpaillot, followed by dâ€™Artagnan. Aramis
came behind, giving his arm to Porthos. Aramis mumbled verses to
himself, and Porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his
mustache, in sign of despair.
But all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which
was familiar to dâ€™Artagnan, and a well-known voice said, â€œMonsieur, I

NA
NA

astonishing in that? He promised to be back by eight oâ€™clock, and eight
is striking. Bravo, Planchet, you are a lad of your word, and if ever
NA
NA
NA
At the same time dâ€™Artagnan felt that Planchet slipped a note into his
hand.
Dâ€™Artagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace Planchet as he had
embraced him on his departure; but he feared lest this mark of
affection, bestowed upon his lackey in the open street, might appear
extraordinary to passers-by, and he restrained himself.
NA
NA
The note burned the hand of dâ€™Artagnan. He wished to hasten their steps;
but Athos took his arm and passed it under his own, and the young man
was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend.
At length they reached the tent, lit a lamp, and while Planchet stood at
the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised, dâ€™Artagnan,
with a trembling hand, broke the seal and opened the so anxiously
expected letter.
It contained half a line, in a hand perfectly British, and with a
conciseness as perfectly Spartan:
Thank you; be easy.
dâ€™Artagnan translated this for the others.
Athos took the letter from the hands of dâ€™Artagnan, approached the lamp,
set fire to the paper, and did not let go till it was reduced to a
cinder.
Then, calling Planchet, he said, â€œNow, my lad, you may claim your seven

Meantime Milady, drunk with passion, roaring on the deck like a lioness
that has been embarked, had been tempted to throw herself into the sea
that she might regain the coast, for she could not get rid of the
thought that she had been insulted by dâ€™Artagnan, threatened by Athos,
and that she had quit France without being revenged on them. This idea
soon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever
terrible consequences might result to herself from it, she implored the
captain to put her on shore; but the captain, eager to escape from his
false position--placed between French and English cruisers, like the bat
between the mice and the birds--was in great haste to regain England,
and positively refused to obey what he took for a womanâ€™s caprice,
promising his passenger, who had been particularly recommended to him by
the cardinal, to land her, if the sea and the French permitted him, at
one of the ports of Brittany, either at Lorient or Brest. But the wind
was contrary, the sea bad; they tacked and kept offshore. Nine days
after leaving the Charente, pale with fatigue and vexation, Milady saw
only the blue coasts of Finisterre appear.
She calculated that to cross this corner of France and return to the
cardinal it would take her at least three days. Add another day for
landing, and that would make four. Add these four to the nine others,
that would be thirteen days lost--thirteen days, during which so many
important events might pass in London. She reflected likewise that the
cardinal would be furious at her return, and consequently would be more
disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the
accusations she brought against others.
She allowed the vessel to pass Lorient and Brest without repeating her
request to the captain, who, on his part, took care not to remind her of
it. Milady therefore continued her voyage, and on the very day that
Planchet embarked at Portsmouth for France, the messenger of his
Eminence entered the port in triumph.
All the city was agitated by an extraordinary movement. Four large
vessels, recently built, had just been launched. At the end of the
jetty, his clothes richly laced with gold, glittering, as was customary
with him, with diamonds and precious stones, his hat ornamented with a
white feather which drooped upon his shoulder, Buckingham was seen
surrounded by a staff almost as brilliant as himself.
It was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when England
remembers that there is a sun. The star of day, pale but nevertheless
still splendid, was setting in the horizon, glorifying at once the
heavens and the sea with bands of fire, and casting upon the towers and
the old houses of the city a last ray of gold which made the windows
sparkle like the reflection of a conflagration. Breathing that sea
breeze, so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is
approached, contemplating all the power of those preparations she was
commissioned to destroy, all the power of that army which she was to
combat alone--she, a woman with a few bags of gold--Milady compared
herself mentally to Judith, the terrible Jewess, when she penetrated the
camp of the Assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots, horses,
men, and arms, which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate like a cloud
of smoke.
They entered the roadstead; but as they drew near in order to cast
anchor, a little cutter, looking like a coastguard formidably armed,
approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which
directed its course to the ladder. This boat contained an officer, a
mate, and eight rowers. The officer alone went on board, where he was
received with all the deference inspired by the uniform.
The officer conversed a few instants with the captain, gave him several
papers, of which he was the bearer, to read, and upon the order of the
merchant captain the whole crew of the vessel, both passengers and
sailors, were called upon deck.
When this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the
point of the brigâ€™s departure, its route, its landings; and to all these
questions the captain replied without difficulty and without hesitation.
Then the officer began to pass in review all the people, one after the
other, and stopping when he came to Milady, surveyed her very closely,
but without addressing a single word to her.
He then returned to the captain, said a few words to him, and as if from
that moment the vessel was under his command, he ordered a maneuver
which the crew executed immediately. Then the vessel resumed its course,
still escorted by the little cutter, which sailed side by side with it,
menacing it with the mouths of its six cannon. The boat followed in the
wake of the ship, a speck near the enormous mass.
During the examination of Milady by the officer, as may well be
imagined, Milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her glances.
But however great was the power of this woman with eyes of flame in
reading the hearts of those whose secrets she wished to divine, she met
this time with a countenance of such impassivity that no discovery
followed her investigation. The officer who had stopped in front of her
and studied her with so much care might have been twenty-five or
twenty-six years of age. He was of pale complexion, with clear blue
eyes, rather deeply set; his mouth, fine and well cut, remained
motionless in its correct lines; his chin, strongly marked, denoted that
strength of will which in the ordinary Britannic type denotes mostly
nothing but obstinacy; a brow a little receding, as is proper for poets,
enthusiasts, and soldiers, was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which,
like the beard which covered the lower part of his face, was of a
beautiful deep chestnut color.
When they entered the port, it was already night. The fog increased the
darkness, and formed round the sternlights and lanterns of the jetty a
circle like that which surrounds the moon when the weather threatens to
become rainy. The air they breathed was heavy, damp, and cold.
Milady, that woman so courageous and firm, shivered in spite of herself.
The officer desired to have Miladyâ€™s packages pointed out to him, and
ordered them to be placed in the boat. When this operation was complete,
he invited her to descend by offering her his hand.

â€œYes, madame, it is the custom, not from gallantry but prudence, that in

These words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most
perfect calmness. Nevertheless, they had not the power of convincing
Milady.

NA
â€œThis measure is general, madame; and you will seek in vain to evade
NA
NA
Accepting the hand of the officer, she began the descent of the ladder,
at the foot of which the boat waited. The officer followed her. A large
cloak was spread at the stern; the officer requested her to sit down
upon this cloak, and placed himself beside her.
NA
The eight oars fell at once into the sea, making but a single sound,
giving but a single stroke, and the boat seemed to fly over the surface
of the water.
In five minutes they gained the land.
The officer leaped to the pier, and offered his hand to Milady. A
carriage was in waiting.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the
carriage; and this operation ended, he took his place beside Milady, and
shut the door.
Immediately, without any order being given or his place of destination
indicated, the coachman set off at a rapid pace, and plunged into the
streets of the city.
So strange a reception naturally gave Milady ample matter for
reflection; so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all
disposed for conversation, she reclined in her corner of the carriage,
and one after the other passed in review all the surmises which
presented themselves to her mind.
At the end of a quarter of an hour, however, surprised at the length of
the journey, she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was
being conducted. Houses were no longer to be seen; trees appeared in the
darkness like great black phantoms chasing one another. Milady
shuddered.
NA
The young officer preserved silence.
â€œI beg you to understand, sir, I will go no farther unless you tell me
NA
This threat brought no reply.
NA
No voice replied to hers; the carriage continued to roll on with
rapidity; the officer seemed a statue.
Milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions
peculiar to her countenance, and which so rarely failed of their effect;
anger made her eyes flash in the darkness.
The young man remained immovable.
Milady tried to open the door in order to throw herself out.
NA
NA
Milady reseated herself, foaming. The officer leaned forward, looked at
her in his turn, and appeared surprised to see that face, just before so
beautiful, distorted with passion and almost hideous. The artful
creature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing
him thus to read her soul; she collected her features, and in a
complaining voice said: â€œIn the name of heaven, sir, tell me if it is to
you, if it is to your government, if it is to an enemy I am to attribute
NA
â€œNo violence will be offered to you, madame, and what happens to you is
the result of a very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
There was so much serenity, coolness, mildness even, in the voice of the
young man, that Milady felt reassured.
At length after a journey of nearly an hour, the carriage stopped before
an iron gate, which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe in form,
massive, and isolated. Then, as the wheels rolled over a fine gravel,
Milady could hear a vast roaring, which she at once recognized as the
noise of the sea dashing against some steep cliff.
The carriage passed under two arched gateways, and at length stopped in
a court large, dark, and square. Almost immediately the door of the
carriage was opened, the young man sprang lightly out and presented his
hand to Milady, who leaned upon it, and in her turn alighted with
tolerable calmness.
NA
bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer;
NA
NA
However flattering this compliment, the officer made no reply; but
drawing from his belt a little silver whistle, such as boatswains use in
ships of war, he whistled three times, with three different modulations.
Immediately several men appeared, who unharnessed the smoking horses,
and put the carriage into a coach house.
Then the officer, with the same calm politeness, invited his prisoner to
enter the house. She, with a still-smiling countenance, took his arm,
and passed with him under a low arched door, which by a vaulted passage,
lighted only at the farther end, led to a stone staircase around an
angle of stone. They then came to a massive door, which after the
introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with
him, turned heavily upon its hinges, and disclosed the chamber destined
for Milady.
With a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest
details. It was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a
prisoner or a free man; and yet bars at the windows and outside bolts at
the door decided the question in favor of the prison.
In an instant all the strength of mind of this creature, though drawn
from the most vigorous sources, abandoned her; she sank into a large
easy chair, with her arms crossed, her head lowered, and expecting every
instant to see a judge enter to interrogate her.
But no one entered except two or three marines, who brought her trunks
and packages, deposited them in a corner, and retired without speaking.
The officer superintended all these details with the same calmness
Milady had constantly seen in him, never pronouncing a word himself, and
making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his
whistle.
It might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken
language did not exist, or had become useless.
At length Milady could hold out no longer; she broke the silence. â€œIn

foresee, for every misfortune which I understand. Where am I, and why am

At the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the stairs. Some
voices passed and faded away, and the sound of a single footstep

open, and drawing himself up in an attitude of respect.
At the same time the door opened; a man appeared on the threshold. He
was without a hat, carried a sword, and flourished a handkerchief in his
hand.
Milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom; she supported
herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair, and advanced her head
as if to meet a certainty.
The stranger advanced slowly, and as he advanced, after entering into
the circle of light projected by the lamp, Milady involuntarily drew
back.
Then when she had no longer any doubt, she cried, in a state of stupor,

Then, turning toward the door, and seeing that the young officer was

50 CHAT BETWEEN BROTHER AND SISTER
During the time which Lord de Winter took to shut the door, close a
shutter, and draw a chair near to his sister-in-lawâ€™s fauteuil, Milady,
anxiously thoughtful, plunged her glance into the depths of possibility,
and discovered all the plan, of which she could not even obtain a glance
as long as she was ignorant into whose hands she had fallen. She knew
her brother-in-law to be a worthy gentleman, a bold hunter, an intrepid
player, enterprising with women, but by no means remarkable for his
skill in intrigues. How had he discovered her arrival, and caused her to
be seized? Why did he detain her?
Athos had dropped some words which proved that the conversation she had
with the cardinal had fallen into outside ears; but she could not
suppose that he had dug a countermine so promptly and so boldly. She
rather feared that her preceding operations in England might have been
discovered. Buckingham might have guessed that it was she who had cut
off the two studs, and avenge himself for that little treachery; but
Buckingham was incapable of going to any excess against a woman,
particularly if that woman was supposed to have acted from a feeling of
jealousy.
This supposition appeared to her most reasonable. It seemed to her that
they wanted to revenge the past, and not to anticipate the future. At
all events, she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands
of her brother-in-law, with whom she reckoned she could deal very
easily, rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent
enemy.
NA
decided as she was to draw from the conversation, in spite of all the
dissimulation Lord de Winter could bring, the revelations of which she
stood in need to regulate her future conduct.
NA
â€œin spite of the resolutions you so often expressed in Paris never to

Milady replied to this question by another question. â€œTo begin with,

Lord de Winter adopted the same tactics as Milady, thinking that as his
sister-in-law employed them they must be the best.

aggravated by this reply the suspicions to which dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s letter had
given birth in the mind of her brother-in-law, and only desiring to gain
the good will of her auditor by a falsehood.

â€œSo it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the

the most touching ingenuousness.
NA
his eyes on those of Milady.
Whatever command she had over herself, Milady could not help starting;
and as in pronouncing the last words Lord de Winter placed his hand upon
the arm of his sister, this start did not escape him.
In fact, the blow was direct and severe. The first idea that occurred to
Miladyâ€™s mind was that she had been betrayed by Kitty, and that she had
recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which she
had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her servant. She
also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon
dâ€™Artagnan when he spared the life of her brother.
NA
her adversary speak out. â€œWhat do you mean to say? Is there any secret

NA

I suspect that you feel it; and in order to spare you all the annoyances
of a nocturnal arrival in a port and all the fatigues of landing, I send
one of my officers to meet you, I place a carriage at his orders, and he
brings you hither to this castle, of which I am governor, whither I come
every day, and where, in order to satisfy our mutual desire of seeing
each other, I have prepared you a chamber. What is there more
astonishing in all that I have said to you than in what you have told
NA
NA
â€œAnd yet that is the most simple thing in the world, my dear sister.
Have you not observed that the captain of your little vessel, on
entering the roadstead, sent forward, in order to obtain permission to
enter the port, a little boat bearing his logbook and the register of
his voyagers? I am commandant of the port. They brought me that book. I
recognized your name in it. My heart told me what your mouth has just
confirmed--that is to say, with what view you have exposed yourself to
the dangers of a sea so perilous, or at least so troublesome at this

Milady knew that Lord de Winter lied, and she was the more alarmed.

â€œYes, your French husband. I donâ€™t speak of my brother. If you have

A cold sweat burst from the brow of Milady.

wrists.

NA
NA

â€œWomen are very indiscreet, my sister. Cannot I serve you as a waiting

nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œPerhaps so; and I have an excuse, for mine would not be the first hand
NA
And the baron pointed, with a slow and accusing gesture, to the left
shoulder of Milady, which he almost touched with his finger.
Milady uttered a deep, inward shriek, and retreated to a corner of the
room like a panther which crouches for a spring.
NA

here no procurators who regulate successions beforehand. There is no
knight-errant to come and seek a quarrel with me on account of the fair
lady I detain a prisoner; but I have judges quite ready who will quickly
dispose of a woman so shameless as to glide, a bigamist, into the bed of
Lord de Winter, my brother. And these judges, I warn you, will soon send
NA
The eyes of Milady darted such flashes that although he was a man and
armed before an unarmed woman, he felt the chill of fear glide through
his whole frame. However, he continued all the same, but with increasing
warmth: â€œYes, I can very well understand that after having inherited the
fortune of my brother it would be very agreeable to you to be my heir
likewise; but know beforehand, if you kill me or cause me to be killed,
my precautions are taken. Not a penny of what I possess will pass into
your hands. Were you not already rich enough--you who possess nearly a
million? And could you not stop your fatal career, if you did not do
evil for the infinite and supreme joy of doing it? Oh, be assured, if
the memory of my brother were not sacred to me, you should rot in a
state dungeon or satisfy the curiosity of sailors at Tyburn. I will be
silent, but you must endure your captivity quietly. In fifteen or twenty
days I shall set out for La Rochelle with the army; but on the eve of my
departure a vessel which I shall see depart will take you hence and
convey you to our colonies in the south. And be assured that you shall
be accompanied by one who will blow your brains out at the first attempt

Milady listened with an attention that dilated her inflamed eyes.
NA
castle. The walls are thick, the doors strong, and the bars solid;
besides, your window opens immediately over the sea. The men of my crew,
who are devoted to me for life and death, mount guard around this
apartment, and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard. Even
if you gained the yard, there would still be three iron gates for you to
pass. The order is positive. A step, a gesture, a word, on your part,
denoting an effort to escape, and you are to be fired upon. If they kill
you, English justice will be under an obligation to me for having saved
it trouble. Ah! I see your features regain their calmness, your
countenance recovers its assurance. You are saying to yourself: â€˜Fifteen
days, twenty days? Bah! I have an inventive mind; before that is expired
some idea will occur to me. I have an infernal spirit. I shall meet with
a victim. Before fifteen days are gone by I shall be away from here.â€™
NA
Milady, finding her thoughts betrayed, dug her nails into her flesh to
subdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except
agony.
Lord de Winter continued: â€œThe officer who commands here in my absence
you have already seen, and therefore know him. He knows how, as you must
have observed, to obey an order--for you did not, I am sure, come from
Portsmouth hither without endeavoring to make him speak. What do you say
of him? Could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute?
You have already tried the power of your seductions upon many men, and
unfortunately you have always succeeded; but I give you leave to try
them upon this one. PARDIEU! if you succeed with him, I pronounce you
NA
He went toward the door and opened it hastily.
NA
NA
There followed between these two personages a strange silence, during
which the sound of a slow and regular step was heard approaching.
Shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor, and the
young lieutenant, with whom we are already acquainted, stopped at the
threshold to receive the orders of the baron.

The young officer entered.

beautiful; she possesses all earthly seductions. Well, she is a monster,
who, at twenty-five years of age, has been guilty of as many crimes as
you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribunals. Her voice
prejudices her hearers in her favor; her beauty serves as a bait to her
victims; her body even pays what she promises--I must do her that
justice. She will try to seduce you, perhaps she will try to kill you. I
have extricated you from misery, Felton; I have caused you to be named
lieutenant; I once saved your life, you know on what occasion. I am for
you not only a protector, but a friend; not only a benefactor, but a
father. This woman has come back again into England for the purpose of
conspiring against my life. I hold this serpent in my hands. Well, I
call you, and say to you: Friend Felton, John, my child, guard me, and
more particularly guard yourself, against this woman. Swear, by your
hopes of salvation, to keep her safely for the chastisement she has
merited. John Felton, I trust your word! John Felton, I put faith in

Milady received this look like a resigned victim; it was impossible to
imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which
prevailed on her beautiful countenance. Lord de Winter himself could
scarcely recognize the tigress who, a minute before, prepared apparently
for a fight.

Milady let her head sink, as if crushed by this sentence. Lord de Winter
went out, making a sign to Felton, who followed him, shutting the door
after him.
One instant after, the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel was
heard in the corridor--his ax in his girdle and his musket on his
shoulder.
Milady remained for some minutes in the same position, for she thought
they might perhaps be examining her through the keyhole; she then slowly
raised her head, which had resumed its formidable expression of menace
and defiance, ran to the door to listen, looked out of her window, and
returning to bury herself again in her large armchair, she reflected.
51 OFFICER
Meanwhile, the cardinal looked anxiously for news from England; but no
news arrived that was not annoying and threatening.
Although La Rochelle was invested, however certain success might
appear--thanks to the precautions taken, and above all to the dyke,
which prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged city--the
blockade might last a long time yet. This was a great affront to the
kingâ€™s army, and a great inconvenience to the cardinal, who had no
longer, it is true, to embroil Louis XIII with Anne of Austria--for that
affair was over--but he had to adjust matters for M. de Bassompierre,
who was embroiled with the Duc dâ€™Angouleme.
As to Monsieur, who had begun the siege, he left to the cardinal the
task of finishing it.
The city, notwithstanding the incredible perseverance of its mayor, had
attempted a sort of mutiny for a surrender; the mayor had hanged the
mutineers. This execution quieted the ill-disposed, who resolved to
allow themselves to die of hunger--this death always appearing to them
more slow and less sure than strangulation.
On their side, from time to time, the besiegers took the messengers
which the Rochellais sent to Buckingham, or the spies which Buckingham
sent to the Rochellais. In one case or the other, the trial was soon
NA
invited to come and see the hanging. He came languidly, placing himself
in a good situation to see all the details. This amused him sometimes a
little, and made him endure the siege with patience; but it did not
prevent his getting very tired, or from talking at every moment of
returning to Paris--so that if the messengers and the spies had failed,
his Eminence, notwithstanding all his inventiveness, would have found
himself much embarrassed.
Nevertheless, time passed on, and the Rochellais did not surrender. The
last spy that was taken was the bearer of a letter. This letter told
Buckingham that the city was at an extremity; but instead of adding, â€œIf
NA
added, quite simply, â€œIf your succor comes not within fifteen days, we
NA
The Rochellais, then, had no hope but in Buckingham. Buckingham was
their Messiah. It was evident that if they one day learned positively
that they must not count on Buckingham, their courage would fail with
their hope.
The cardinal looked, then, with great impatience for the news from
England which would announce to him that Buckingham would not come.
The question of carrying the city by assault, though often debated in
the council of the king, had been always rejected. In the first place,
La Rochelle appeared impregnable. Then the cardinal, whatever he said,
very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter, in which
Frenchman would combat against Frenchman, was a retrograde movement of
sixty years impressed upon his policy; and the cardinal was at that
period what we now call a man of progress. In fact, the sack of La
Rochelle, and the assassination of three of four thousand Huguenots who
allowed themselves to be killed, would resemble too closely, in 1628,
the massacre of St. Bartholomew in 1572; and then, above all this, this
extreme measure, which was not at all repugnant to the king, good
Catholic as he was, always fell before this argument of the besieging
generals--La Rochelle is impregnable except to famine.
The cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of
his terrible emissary--for he comprehended the strange qualities of this
woman, sometimes a serpent, sometimes a lion. Had she betrayed him? Was
she dead? He knew her well enough in all cases to know that, whether
acting for or against him, as a friend or an enemy, she would not remain
motionless without great impediments; but whence did these impediments
arise? That was what he could not know.
And yet he reckoned, and with reason, on Milady. He had divined in the
past of this woman terrible things which his red mantle alone could
cover; and he felt, from one cause or another, that this woman was his
own, as she could look to no other but himself for a support superior to
the danger which threatened her.
He resolved, then, to carry on the war alone, and to look for no success
foreign to himself, but as we look for a fortunate chance. He continued
to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve La Rochelle.
Meanwhile, he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city, which contained
so much deep misery and so many heroic virtues, and recalling the saying
of Louis XI, his political predecessor, as he himself was the
predecessor of Robespierre, he repeated this maxim of Tristanâ€™s gossip:
NA
Henry IV, when besieging Paris, had loaves and provisions thrown over
the walls. The cardinal had little notes thrown over in which he
represented to the Rochellais how unjust, selfish, and barbarous was the
conduct of their leaders. These leaders had corn in abundance, and would
not let them partake of it; they adopted as a maxim--for they, too, had
maxims--that it was of very little consequence that women, children, and
old men should die, so long as the men who were to defend the walls
remained strong and healthy. Up to that time, whether from devotedness
or from want of power to act against it, this maxim, without being
generally adopted, nevertheless passed from theory into practice; but
the notes did it injury. The notes reminded the men that the children,
women, and old men whom they allowed to die were their sons, their
wives, and their fathers, and that it would be more just for everyone to
be reduced to the common misery, in order that equal conditions should
give birth to unanimous resolutions.
These notes had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect, in
that they induced a great number of the inhabitants to open private
negotiations with the royal army.
But at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing fruit,
and applauded himself for having put it in action, an inhabitant of La
Rochelle who had contrived to pass the royal lines--God knows how, such
was the watchfulness of Bassompierre, Schomberg, and the Duc
dâ€™Angouleme, themselves watched over by the cardinal--an inhabitant of
La Rochelle, we say, entered the city, coming from Portsmouth, and
saying that he had seen a magnificent fleet ready to sail within eight
days. Still further, Buckingham announced to the mayor that at length
the great league was about to declare itself against France, and that
the kingdom would be at once invaded by the English, Imperial, and
Spanish armies. This letter was read publicly in all parts of the city.
Copies were put up at the corners of the streets; and even they who had
begun to open negotiations interrupted them, being resolved to await the
succor so pompously announced.
This unexpected circumstance brought back Richelieuâ€™s former anxiety,
and forced him in spite of himself once more to turn his eyes to the
other side of the sea.
During this time, exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief,
the royal army led a joyous life, neither provisions nor money being
wanting in the camp. All the corps rivaled one another in audacity and
gaiety. To take spies and hang them, to make hazardous expeditions upon
the dyke or the sea, to imagine wild plans, and to execute them
coolly--such were the pastimes which made the army find these days short
which were not only so long to the Rochellais, a prey to famine and
anxiety, but even to the cardinal, who blockaded them so closely.
Sometimes when the cardinal, always on horseback, like the lowest
GENDARME of the army, cast a pensive glance over those works, so slowly
keeping pace with his wishes, which the engineers, brought from all the
corners of France, were executing under his orders, if he met a
Musketeer of the company of Treville, he drew near and looked at him in
a peculiar manner, and not recognizing in him one of our four
companions, he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in
another direction.
One day when oppressed with a mortal weariness of mind, without hope in
the negotiations with the city, without news from England, the cardinal
went out, without any other aim than to be out of doors, and accompanied
only by Cahusac and La Houdiniere, strolled along the beach. Mingling
the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the ocean, he came,
his horse going at a footâ€™s pace, to a hill from the top of which he
perceived behind a hedge, reclining on the sand and catching in its
passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this period of the year,
seven men surrounded by empty bottles. Four of these men were our
Musketeers, preparing to listen to a letter one of them had just
received. This letter was so important that it made them forsake their
cards and their dice on the drumhead.
The other three were occupied in opening an enormous flagon of Collicure
wine; these were the lackeys of these gentlemen.
The cardinal was, as we have said, in very low spirits; and nothing when
he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety
in others. Besides, he had another strange fancy, which was always to
believe that the causes of his sadness created the gaiety of others.
Making a sign to La Houdiniere and Cahusac to stop, he alighted from his
horse, and went toward these suspected merry companions, hoping, by
means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge
which concealed his approach, to catch some words of this conversation
which appeared so interesting. At ten paces from the hedge he recognized
the talkative Gascon; and as he had already perceived that these men
were Musketeers, he did not doubt that the three others were those
called the Inseparables; that is to say, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.
It may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was
augmented by this discovery. His eyes took a strange expression, and
with the step of a tiger-cat he advanced toward the hedge; but he had
not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any
positive sense, when a sonorous and short cry made him start, and
attracted the attention of the Musketeers.
NA
NA
and transfixing Grimaud with his flaming look.
Grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech, but contented himself
with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge, announcing
by this gesture the cardinal and his escort.
With a single bound the Musketeers were on their feet, and saluted with
respect.
The cardinal seemed furious.
NA

preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him,
â€œMonseigneur, the Musketeers, when they are not on duty, or when their

â€œYour Eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution, we

These words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which
distinguished Athos in the hour of danger, and with that excessive
politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic
than kings by birth.
Dâ€™Artagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which
soon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal.
NA
appearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the
diversion which Athos had started, â€œit does not signify, gentlemen. I do
not like to have simple soldiers, because they have the advantage of
serving in a privileged corps, thus to play the great lords; discipline
NA
Athos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely, and bowed
in sign of assent. Then he resumed in his turn: â€œDiscipline,
Monseigneur, has, I hope, in no way been forgotten by us. We are not on
duty, and we believed that not being on duty we were at liberty to
dispose of our time as we pleased. If we are so fortunate as to have
some particular duty to perform for your Eminence, we are ready to obey

And he showed the cardinal, with his finger, the four muskets piled near

The color mounted to the face of Athos, and he made a step toward his
Eminence.
â€œOne might think you really suspected us, monseigneur, and we were
undergoing a real interrogatory. If it be so, we trust your Eminence
will deign to explain yourself, and we should then at least be

risked his head in making this reply, â€œthe letter is a womanâ€™s letter,

The cardinal became as pale as death; lightning darted from his eyes. He
turned round as if to give an order to Cahusac and Houdiniere. Athos saw
the movement; he made a step toward the muskets, upon which the other
three friends had fixed their eyes, like men ill-disposed to allow
themselves to be taken. The cardinalists were three; the Musketeers,
lackeys included, were seven. He judged that the match would be so much
the less equal, if Athos and his companions were really plotting; and by
one of those rapid turns which he always had at command, all his anger
faded away into a smile.
NA

yourselves, when you watch so carefully over others. Gentlemen, I have
not forgotten the night in which you served me as an escort to the Red
Dovecot. If there were any danger to be apprehended on the road I am
going, I would request you to accompany me; but as there is none, remain
where you are, finish your bottles, your game, and your letter. Adieu,
NA
And remounting his horse, which Cahusac led to him, he saluted them with
his hand, and rode away.
The four young men, standing and motionless, followed him with their
eyes without speaking a single word until he had disappeared. Then they
looked at one another.
The countenances of all gave evidence of terror, for notwithstanding the
friendly adieu of his Eminence, they plainly perceived that the cardinal
went away with rage in his heart.
Athos alone smiled, with a self-possessed, disdainful smile.
When the cardinal was out of hearing and sight, â€œThat Grimaud kept bad

on somebody.
Grimaud was about to reply to excuse himself. Athos lifted his finger,
and Grimaud was silent.

Whose is the ocean upon which we look? Whose is the sand upon which we
were reclining? Whose is that letter of your mistress? Do these belong
to the cardinal? Upon my honor, this man fancies the world belongs to
him. There you stood, stammering, stupefied, annihilated. One might have
supposed the Bastille appeared before you, and that the gigantic Medusa
had converted you into stone. Is being in love conspiring? You are in
love with a woman whom the cardinal has caused to be shut up, and you
wish to get her out of the hands of the cardinal. Thatâ€™s a match you are
playing with his Eminence; this letter is your game. Why should you
expose your game to your adversary? That is never done. Let him find it

â€œIn that case, let there be no more question of whatâ€™s past, and let

Aramis drew the letter from his pocket; the three friends surrounded

â€œMy dear Cousin,
â€œI think I shall make up my mind to set out for Bethune, where my sister

poor child is quite resigned, as she knows she cannot live elsewhere
without the salvation of her soul being in danger. Nevertheless, if the
affairs of our family are arranged, as we hope they will be, I believe
she will run the risk of being damned, and will return to those she
regrets, particularly as she knows they are always thinking of her.
Meanwhile, she is not very wretched; what she most desires is a letter
from her intended. I know that such viands pass with difficulty through
convent gratings; but after all, as I have given you proofs, my dear
cousin, I am not unskilled in such affairs, and I will take charge of
the commission. My sister thanks you for your good and eternal
remembrance. She has experienced much anxiety; but she is now at length
a little reassured, having sent her secretary away in order that nothing
may happen unexpectedly.

in his hand, he ground the paper well between his teeth and then
swallowed it.

raised toward heaven during this delicious occupation, spoke a language

Meantime, his Eminence continued his melancholy ride, murmuring between

52 CAPTIVITY: THE FIRST DAY
Let us return to Milady, whom a glance thrown upon the coast of France
has made us lose sight of for an instant.
We shall find her still in the despairing attitude in which we left her,
plunged in an abyss of dismal reflection--a dark hell at the gate of
which she has almost left hope behind, because for the first time she
doubts, for the first time she fears.
On two occasions her fortune has failed her, on two occasions she has
found herself discovered and betrayed; and on these two occasions it was
to one fatal genius, sent doubtlessly by the Lord to combat her, that
she has succumbed. Dâ€™Artagnan has conquered her--her, that invincible
power of evil.
He has deceived her in her love, humbled her in her pride, thwarted her
in her ambition; and now he ruins her fortune, deprives her of liberty,
and even threatens her life. Still more, he has lifted the corner of her
mask--that shield with which she covered herself and which rendered her
so strong.
Dâ€™Artagnan has turned aside from Buckingham, whom she hates as she hates
everyone she has loved, the tempest with which Richelieu threatened him
in the person of the queen. Dâ€™Artagnan had passed himself upon her as de
Wardes, for whom she had conceived one of those tigerlike fancies common
to women of her character. Dâ€™Artagnan knows that terrible secret which
she has sworn no one shall know without dying. In short, at the moment
in which she has just obtained from Richelieu a carte blanche by the
means of which she is about to take vengeance on her enemy, this
precious paper is torn from her hands, and it is dâ€™Artagnan who holds
her prisoner and is about to send her to some filthy Botany Bay, some
infamous Tyburn of the Indian Ocean.
All this she owes to dâ€™Artagnan, without doubt. From whom can come so
many disgraces heaped upon her head, if not from him? He alone could
have transmitted to Lord de Winter all these frightful secrets which he
has discovered, one after another, by a train of fatalities. He knows
her brother-in-law. He must have written to him.
What hatred she distills! Motionless, with her burning and fixed
glances, in her solitary apartment, how well the outbursts of passion
which at times escape from the depths of her chest with her respiration,
accompany the sound of the surf which rises, growls, roars, and breaks
itself like an eternal and powerless despair against the rocks on which
is built this dark and lofty castle! How many magnificent projects of
vengeance she conceives by the light of the flashes which her
tempestuous passion casts over her mind against Mme. Bonacieux, against
Buckingham, but above all against dâ€™Artagnan--projects lost in the
distance of the future.
Yes; but in order to avenge herself she must be free. And to be free, a
prisoner has to pierce a wall, detach bars, cut through a floor--all
undertakings which a patient and strong man may accomplish, but before
which the feverish irritations of a woman must give way. Besides, to do
all this, time is necessary--months, years; and she has ten or twelve
days, as Lord de Winter, her fraternal and terrible jailer, has told
her.
And yet, if she were a man she would attempt all this, and perhaps might
succeed; why, then, did heaven make the mistake of placing that manlike
soul in that frail and delicate body?
The first moments of her captivity were terrible; a few convulsions of
rage which she could not suppress paid her debt of feminine weakness to
nature. But by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion;
and nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared, and she
remained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in repose.
â€œGo to, go to! I must have been mad to allow myself to be carried away
NA
the burning glance by which she appears to interrogate herself. â€œNo
violence; violence is the proof of weakness. In the first place, I have
never succeeded by that means. Perhaps if I employed my strength against
women I might perchance find them weaker than myself, and consequently
conquer them; but it is with men that I struggle, and I am but a woman
to them. Let me fight like a woman, then; my strength is in my
NA
Then, as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could
place upon her countenance, so mobile and so expressive, she made it
take all expressions from that of passionate anger, which convulsed her
features, to that of the most sweet, most affectionate, and most
seducing smile. Then her hair assumed successively, under her skillful
hands, all the undulations she thought might assist the charms of her
face. At length she murmured, satisfied with herself, â€œCome, nothing is
NA
It was then nearly eight oâ€™clock in the evening. Milady perceived a bed;
she calculated that the repose of a few hours would not only refresh her
head and her ideas, but still further, her complexion. A better idea,
however, came into her mind before going to bed. She had heard something
said about supper. She had already been an hour in this apartment; they
could not long delay bringing her a repast. The prisoner did not wish to
lose time; and she resolved to make that very evening some attempts to
ascertain the nature of the ground she had to work upon, by studying the
characters of the men to whose guardianship she was committed.
A light appeared under the door; this light announced the reappearance
of her jailers. Milady, who had arisen, threw herself quickly into the
armchair, her head thrown back, her beautiful hair unbound and
disheveled, her bosom half bare beneath her crumpled lace, one hand on
her heart, and the other hanging down.
The bolts were drawn; the door groaned upon its hinges. Steps sounded in
the chamber, and drew near.
NA
that of Felton.
The order was executed.
NA
And this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same
individuals proved to Milady that her servants were the same men as her
guards; that is to say, soldiers.
Feltonâ€™s orders were, for the rest, executed with a silent rapidity that
gave a good idea of the way in which he maintained discipline.
At length Felton, who had not yet looked at Milady, turned toward her.

The soldier went out to obey the orders of his officer. Felton sat down
upon an armchair which happened to be near the door, and waited without
speaking a word, without making a gesture. Milady possessed that great
art, so much studied by women, of looking through her long eyelashes
without appearing to open the lids. She perceived Felton, who sat with
his back toward her. She continued to look at him for nearly ten
minutes, and in these ten minutes the immovable guardian never turned
round once.
She then thought that Lord de Winter would come, and by his presence
give fresh strength to her jailer. Her first trial was lost; she acted
like a woman who reckons up her resources. As a result she raised her
head, opened her eyes, and sighed deeply.
At this sigh Felton turned round.
NA
NA
NA
harmonious voice which, like that of the ancient enchantresses, charmed
all whom she wished to destroy.
And she assumed, upon sitting up in the armchair, a still more graceful
and abandoned position than when she reclined.
Felton arose.
NA

at eight. If that does not suit you, you can point out what other hours

â€œA woman of the neighbourhood has been sent for, who will be tomorrow at

NA
Felton made a slight bow, and directed his steps toward the door. At the
moment he was about to go out, Lord de Winter appeared in the corridor,
followed by the soldier who had been sent to inform him of the swoon of
Milady. He held a vial of salts in his hand.
NA
on seeing the prisoner sitting up and Felton about to go out. â€œIs this
corpse come to life already? Felton, my lad, did you not perceive that
you were taken for a novice, and that the first act was being performed
of a comedy of which we shall doubtless have the pleasure of following

NA
after all, I wish to pay her the attention that every man of gentle

Milady shuddered through her whole system. These words of Feltonâ€™s
passed like ice through her veins.
NA
disheveled, that white skin, and that languishing look, have not yet

â€œIn that case, my brave lieutenant, let us leave Milady to find out
something else, and go to supper; but be easy! She has a fruitful
imagination, and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps

And at these words Lord de Winter passed his arm through that of Felton,
and led him out, laughing.
NA
assured of that, you poor spoiled monk, you poor converted soldier, who

NA
â€œyou must not, Milady, let this check take away your appetite. Taste
that fowl and those fish. On my honor, they are not poisoned. I have a
very good cook, and he is not to be my heir; I have full and perfect
confidence in him. Do as I do. Adieu, dear sister, till your next
NA
This was all that Milady could endure. Her hands clutched her armchair;
she ground her teeth inwardly; her eyes followed the motion of the door
as it closed behind Lord de Winter and Felton, and the moment she was
alone a fresh fit of despair seized her. She cast her eyes upon the
table, saw the glittering of a knife, rushed toward it and clutched it;
but her disappointment was cruel. The blade was round, and of flexible
silver.
A burst of laughter resounded from the other side of the ill-closed
door, and the door reopened.
NA
donâ€™t you see what I told you? That knife was for you, my lad; she would
have killed you. Observe, this is one of her peculiarities, to get rid
thus, after one fashion or another, of all the people who bother her. If
I had listened to you, the knife would have been pointed and of steel.
Then no more of Felton; she would have cut your throat, and after that
everybody elseâ€™s. See, John, see how well she knows how to handle a

In fact, Milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand; but
these last words, this supreme insult, relaxed her hands, her strength,
and even her will. The knife fell to the ground.
NA
which sounded to the very bottom of the heart of Milady, â€œyou were

And both again left the room.
But this time Milady lent a more attentive ear than the first, and she
heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor.
NA
whom I can have no more influence than upon statues of bronze or
granite; they know me by heart, and are steeled against all my weapons.
NA
In fact, as this last reflection indicated--this instinctive return to
hope--sentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent
spirit. Milady sat down to table, ate from several dishes, drank a
little Spanish wine, and felt all her resolution return.
Before she went to bed she had pondered, analyzed, turned on all sides,
examined on all points, the words, the steps, the gestures, the signs,
and even the silence of her interlocutors; and of this profound,
skillful, and anxious study the result was that Felton, everything
considered, appeared the more vulnerable of her two persecutors.
One expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner: â€œIf I had

Felton, then, had spoken in her favor, since Lord de Winter had not been
willing to listen to him.

to the other, he knows me, he fears me, and knows what he has to expect
of me if ever I escape from his hands. It is useless, then, to attempt
anything with him. But Felton--thatâ€™s another thing. He is a young,
ingenuous, pure man who seems virtuous; him there are means of

And Milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her lips.
Anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl
dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next
festival.
53 CAPTIVITY: THE SECOND DAY
Milady dreamed that she at length had dâ€™Artagnan in her power, that she
was present at his execution; and it was the sight of his odious blood,
flowing beneath the ax of the headsman, which spread that charming smile
upon her lips.
She slept as a prisoner sleeps, rocked by his first hope.
In the morning, when they entered her chamber she was still in bed.
Felton remained in the corridor. He brought with him the woman of whom
he had spoken the evening before, and who had just arrived; this woman
entered, and approaching Miladyâ€™s bed, offered her services.
Milady was habitually pale; her complexion might therefore deceive a
person who saw her for the first time.
NA
all this long night. I suffer horribly. Are you likely to be more humane
to me than others were yesterday? All I ask is permission to remain
NA
NA
Felton listened to this dialogue without speaking a word.
Milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she
would have to work upon, and Lord de Winter would redouble his watch.
Besides, the physician might declare the ailment feigned; and Milady,
after having lost the first trick, was not willing to lose the second.
NA
These gentlemen declared yesterday that my illness was a comedy; it
would be just the same today, no doubt--for since yesterday evening they

â€œEh, how can I tell? My God! I know that I suffer, thatâ€™s all. Give me

that Felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into the room.

Milady made no reply, but turning her beautiful head round upon her
pillow, she burst into tears, and uttered heartbreaking sobs.
Felton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness; then,
seeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged, he went out. The
woman followed him, and Lord de Winter did not appear.

In the morning, when they entered Miladyâ€™s chamber they had brought her
breakfast. Now, she thought, they could not long delay coming to clear
the table, and that Felton would then reappear.
Milady was not deceived. Felton reappeared, and without observing
whether Milady had or had not touched her repast, made a sign that the
table should be carried out of the room, it having been brought in ready
spread.
Felton remained behind; he held a book in his hand.
Milady, reclining in an armchair near the chimney, beautiful, pale, and
resigned, looked like a holy virgin awaiting martyrdom.
Felton approached her, and said, â€œLord de Winter, who is a Catholic,
like yourself, madame, thinking that the deprivation of the rites and
ceremonies of your church might be painful to you, has consented that
you should read every day the ordinary of your Mass; and here is a book
NA
At the manner in which Felton laid the book upon the little table near
which Milady was sitting, at the tone in which he pronounced the two
words, YOUR MASS, at the disdainful smile with which he accompanied
them, Milady raised her head, and looked more attentively at the
officer.
By that plain arrangement of the hair, by that costume of extreme
simplicity, by the brow polished like marble and as hard and
impenetrable, she recognized one of those gloomy Puritans she had so
often met, not only in the court of King James, but in that of the King
of France, where, in spite of the remembrance of the St. Bartholomew,
they sometimes came to seek refuge.
She then had one of those sudden inspirations which only people of
genius receive in great crises, in supreme moments which are to decide
their fortunes or their lives.
Those two words, YOUR MASS, and a simple glance cast upon Felton,
revealed to her all the importance of the reply she was about to make;
but with that rapidity of intelligence which was peculiar to her, this
reply, ready arranged, presented itself to her lips:
NA
had remarked in the voice of the young officer, â€œI, sir? MY MASS? Lord
de Winter, the corrupted Catholic, knows very well that I am not of his
NA
NA
astonishment which in spite of the empire he held over himself he could
not entirely conceal.
NA
NA
The look of Felton revealed to Milady the full extent of the space she
had opened for herself by this single word.
The young officer, however, remained mute and motionless; his look alone
had spoken.
NA
enthusiasm which she knew was familiar to the Puritans. â€œWell, let my
God save me, or let me perish for my God! That is the reply I beg you to

manual with her finger but without touching it, as if she must be
contaminated by it, â€œyou may carry it back and make use of it yourself,
for doubtless you are doubly the accomplice of Lord de Winter--the

Felton made no reply, took the book with the same appearance of
repugnance which he had before manifested, and retired pensively.
Lord de Winter came toward five oâ€™clock in the evening. Milady had had
time, during the whole day, to trace her plan of conduct. She received
him like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages.

But never mind; that sort of intoxication is not dangerous, and will

And Lord de Winter retired swearing, which at that period was a very
knightly habit.
Felton was indeed behind the door, and had not lost one word of this
scene. Milady had guessed aright.
NA

NA
Silence was re-established. Two hours passed away. Miladyâ€™s supper was
brought in, and she was found deeply engaged in saying her prayers
aloud--prayers which she had learned of an old servant of her second
husband, a most austere Puritan. She appeared to be in ecstasy, and did
not pay the least attention to what was going on around her. Felton made
a sign that she should not be disturbed; and when all was arranged, he
went out quietly with the soldiers.
Milady knew she might be watched, so she continued her prayers to the
end; and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her door
did not march with the same step, and seemed to listen. For the moment
she wished nothing better. She arose, came to the table, ate but little,
and drank only water.
An hour after, her table was cleared; but Milady remarked that this time
Felton did not accompany the soldiers. He feared, then, to see her too
often.
She turned toward the wall to smile--for there was in this smile such an
expression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed her.
She allowed, therefore, half an hour to pass away; and as at that moment
all was silence in the old castle, as nothing was heard but the eternal
murmur of the waves--that immense breaking of the ocean--with her pure,
harmonious, and powerful voice, she began the first couplet of the psalm
then in great favor with the Puritans:
â€œThou leavest thy servants, Lord, To see if they be strong; But soon
NA
These verses were not excellent--very far from it; but as it is well
known, the Puritans did not pique themselves upon their poetry.
While singing, Milady listened. The soldier on guard at her door
stopped, as if he had been changed into stone. Milady was then able to
judge of the effect she had produced.
Then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and feeling. It
appeared to her that the sounds spread to a distance beneath the vaulted
roofs, and carried with them a magic charm to soften the hearts of her
jailers. It however likewise appeared that the soldier on duty--a
zealous Catholic, no doubt--shook off the charm, for through the door he
called: â€œHold your tongue, madame! Your song is as dismal as a â€˜De
profundisâ€™; and if besides the pleasure of being in garrison here, we

that of Felton. â€œWhat are you meddling with, stupid? Did anybody order
you to prevent that woman from singing? No. You were told to guard
her--to fire at her if she attempted to fly. Guard her! If she flies,
NA
An expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of Milady;
but this expression was fleeting as the reflection of lightning. Without
appearing to have heard the dialogue, of which she had not lost a word,
she began again, giving to her voice all the charm, all the power, all
the seduction the demon had bestowed upon it:
â€œFor all my tears, my cares, My exile, and my chains, I have my youth,
NA
Her voice, of immense power and sublime expression, gave to the rude,
unpolished poetry of these psalms a magic and an effect which the most
exalted Puritans rarely found in the songs of their brethren, and which
they were forced to ornament with all the resources of their
imagination. Felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who
consoled the three Hebrews in the furnace.
Milady continued:
â€œOne day our doors will ope, With God come our desire; And if betrays

This verse, into which the terrible enchantress threw her whole soul,
completed the trouble which had seized the heart of the young officer.
He opened the door quickly; and Milady saw him appear, pale as usual,
but with his eye inflamed and almost wild.

Milady was so beautiful at this moment, the religious ecstasy in which
she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance,
that Felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he
had only just before heard.

The poor, senseless young man was not aware of the incoherence of his
words, while Milady was reading with her lynxâ€™s eyes the very depths of

54 CAPTIVITY: THE THIRD DAY
Felton had fallen; but there was still another step to be taken. He must
be retained, or rather he must be left quite alone; and Milady but
obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this result.
Still more must be done. He must be made to speak, in order that he
might be spoken to--for Milady very well knew that her greatest
seduction was in her voice, which so skillfully ran over the whole gamut
of tones from human speech to language celestial.
Yet in spite of all this seduction Milady might fail--for Felton was
forewarned, and that against the least chance. From that moment she
watched all his actions, all his words, from the simplest glance of his
eyes to his gestures--even to a breath that could be interpreted as a
sigh. In short, she studied everything, as a skillful comedian does to
whom a new part has been assigned in a line to which he is not
accustomed.
Face to face with Lord de Winter her plan of conduct was more easy. She
had laid that down the preceding evening. To remain silent and dignified
in his presence; from time to time to irritate him by affected disdain,
by a contemptuous word; to provoke him to threats and violence which
would produce a contrast with her own resignation--such was her plan.
Felton would see all; perhaps he would say nothing, but he would see.
In the morning, Felton came as usual; but Milady allowed him to preside
over all the preparations for breakfast without addressing a word to
him. At the moment when he was about to retire, she was cheered with a
ray of hope, for she thought he was about to speak; but his lips moved
without any sound leaving his mouth, and making a powerful effort to
control himself, he sent back to his heart the words that were about to
escape from his lips, and went out. Toward midday, Lord de Winter
entered.
It was a tolerably fine winterâ€™s day, and a ray of that pale English sun
which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her prison.
Milady was looking out at the window, and pretended not to hear the door
as it opened.
NA
NA
The prisoner made no reply.
NA

At the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening
of the nearly closed door, and she perceived Felton, who drew quickly to
one side to prevent being seen by her.
Then she threw herself upon her knees, and began to pray.

The door opened gently; the beautiful supplicant pretended not to hear
the noise, and in a voice broken by tears, she continued:
â€œGod of vengeance! God of goodness! wilt thou allow the frightful

Then only she pretended to hear the sound of Feltonâ€™s steps, and rising
quick as thought, she blushed, as if ashamed of being surprised on her
knees.

twisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of grief.

him, and he made several steps toward the door; but the prisoner, whose
eye never left him, sprang in pursuit of him and stopped him.

the use I would make of it! Oh, hear me to the end! that knife, give it

Then as the steps drew near, she became silent for fear of being heard,
applying, with a gesture of infinite terror, her beautiful hand to
Feltonâ€™s mouth.
Felton gently repulsed Milady, and she sank into a chair.
Lord de Winter passed before the door without stopping, and they heard
the noise of his footsteps soon die away.
Felton, as pale as death, remained some instants with his ear bent and
listening; then, when the sound was quite extinct, he breathed like a
man awaking from a dream, and rushed out of the apartment.

Milady trembled; she thought Felton had told all. Perhaps never in her
life had this woman, who had experienced so many opposite and powerful
emotions, felt her heart beat so violently.
She was seated. Lord de Winter took a chair, drew it toward her, and sat
down close beside her. Then taking a paper out of his pocket, he
unfolded it slowly.

Then turning his eyes from Milady to the paper, he read: â€œâ€˜Order to

â€œâ€˜Order to conduct to--the person named Charlotte Backson, branded by

Milady remained silent; only this time it was no longer from
affectation, but from terror. She believed the order ready for
execution. She thought that Lord de Winter had hastened her departure;
she thought she was condemned to set off that very evening. Everything
in her mind was lost for an instant; when all at once she perceived that
no signature was attached to the order. The joy she felt at this
discovery was so great she could not conceal it.
NA
mind; â€œyes, you look for the signature, and you say to yourself: â€˜All is
not lost, for that order is not signed. It is only shown to me to
terrify me, thatâ€™s all.â€™ You are mistaken. Tomorrow this order will be
sent to the Duke of Buckingham. The day after tomorrow it will return

afterward I will answer for its being carried into execution. Adieu,

Milady made no reply, but became as pale as a corpse.
â€œOh, I see you prefer peregrination. Thatâ€™s well madame; and there is an
old proverb that says, â€˜Traveling trains youth.â€™ My faith! you are not
wrong after all, and life is sweet. Thatâ€™s the reason why I take such
care you shall not deprive me of mine. There only remains, then, the
question of the five shillings to be settled. You think me rather
parsimonious, donâ€™t you? Thatâ€™s because I donâ€™t care to leave you the
means of corrupting your jailers. Besides, you will always have your
charms left to seduce them with. Employ them, if your check with regard

â€œAnd now, madame, till I see you again! Tomorrow I will come and
NA
Lord de Winter rose, saluted her ironically, and went out.
Milady breathed again. She had still four days before her. Four days
would quite suffice to complete the seduction of Felton.
A terrible idea, however, rushed into her mind. She thought that Lord de
Winter would perhaps send Felton himself to get the order signed by the
Duke of Buckingham. In that case Felton would escape her--for in order
to secure success, the magic of a continuous seduction was necessary.
Nevertheless, as we have said, one circumstance reassured her. Felton
had not spoken.
As she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of Lord de Winter,
she placed herself at the table and ate.
Then, as she had done the evening before, she fell on her knees and
repeated her prayers aloud. As on the evening before, the soldier
stopped his march to listen to her.
Soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel, which
came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her door.
NA
so strongly excited Felton the evening before.
But although her voice--sweet, full, and sonorous--vibrated as
harmoniously and as affectingly as ever, the door remained shut. It
appeared however to Milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted
from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the
ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening. But whether
this was reality or vision, he had this time sufficient self-command not
to enter.
However, a few instants after she had finished her religious song,
Milady thought she heard a profound sigh. Then the same steps she had
heard approach slowly withdrew, as if with regret.
55 CAPTIVITY: THE FOURTH DAY
The next day, when Felton entered Miladyâ€™s apartment he found her
standing, mounted upon a chair, holding in her hands a cord made by
means of torn cambric handkerchiefs, twisted into a kind of rope one
with another, and tied at the ends. At the noise Felton made in
entering, Milady leaped lightly to the ground, and tried to conceal
behind her the improvised cord she held in her hand.
The young man was more pale than usual, and his eyes, reddened by want
of sleep, denoted that he had passed a feverish night. Nevertheless, his
brow was armed with a severity more austere than ever.
He advanced slowly toward Milady, who had seated herself, and taking an
end of the murderous rope which by neglect, or perhaps by design, she

Felton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment
before which he had found Milady standing in the armchair in which she
was now seated, and over her head he perceived a gilt-headed screw,
fixed in the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes or weapons.
He started, and the prisoner saw that start--for though her eyes were
cast down, nothing escaped her.

This time Felton, immovable as he was, or appeared to be, could not
resist the secret influence which had already taken possession of him.
To see this woman, so beautiful, fair as the brightest vision, to see
her by turns overcome with grief and threatening; to resist at once the
ascendancy of grief and beauty--it was too much for a visionary; it was
too much for a brain weakened by the ardent dreams of an ecstatic faith;
it was too much for a heart furrowed by the love of heaven that burns,
by the hatred of men that devours.
Milady saw the trouble. She felt by intuition the flame of the opposing
passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic.
As a skillful general, seeing the enemy ready to surrender, marches
toward him with a cry of victory, she rose, beautiful as an antique
priestess, inspired like a Christian virgin, her arms extended, her
throat uncovered, her hair disheveled, holding with one hand her robe
modestly drawn over her breast, her look illumined by that fire which
had already created such disorder in the veins of the young Puritan, and
went toward him, crying out with a vehement air, and in her melodious
voice, to which on this occasion she communicated a terrible energy:
â€œLet this victim to Baal be sent, To the lions the martyr be thrown! Thy
God shall teach thee to repent! From thâ€™ abyss heâ€™ll give ear to my

Felton stood before this strange apparition like one petrified.

world with his heresies and debaucheries--to that infamous Sardanapalus

sweat, as if to remove his last doubt. â€œYes, I recognize the voice which
speaks to me in my dreams; yes, I recognize the features of the angel
who appears to me every night, crying to my soul, which cannot sleep:
â€˜Strike, save England, save thyself--for thou wilt die without having
NA
A flash of terrible joy, but rapid as thought, gleamed from the eyes of
Milady.
However fugitive this homicide flash, Felton saw it, and started as if
its light had revealed the abysses of this womanâ€™s heart. He recalled,
all at once, the warnings of Lord de Winter, the seductions of Milady,
her first attempts after her arrival. He drew back a step, and hung down
his head, without, however, ceasing to look at her, as if, fascinated by
this strange creature, he could not detach his eyes from her eyes.
Milady was not a woman to misunderstand the meaning of this hesitation.
Under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned her. Before
Felton replied, and before she should be forced to resume this
conversation, so difficult to be sustained in the same exalted tone, she
let her hands fall; and as if the weakness of the woman overpowered the
enthusiasm of the inspired fanatic, she said: â€œBut no, it is not for me
to be the Judith to deliver Bethulia from this Holofernes. The sword of
the eternal is too heavy for my arm. Allow me, then, to avoid dishonor
by death; let me take refuge in martyrdom. I do not ask you for liberty,
as a guilty one would, nor for vengeance, as would a pagan. Let me die;
that is all. I supplicate you, I implore you on my knees--let me die,
NA
Hearing that voice, so sweet and suppliant, seeing that look, so timid
and downcast, Felton reproached himself. By degrees the enchantress had
clothed herself with that magic adornment which she assumed and threw
aside at will; that is to say, beauty, meekness, and tears--and above
all, the irresistible attraction of mystical voluptuousness, the most
devouring of all voluptuousness.
NA
you prove to me you are a victim! But Lord de Winter makes cruel
accusations against you. You are a Christian; you are my sister in
religion. I feel myself drawn toward you--I, who have never loved anyone
but my benefactor--I who have met with nothing but traitors and impious
men. But you, madame, so beautiful in reality, you, so pure in
appearance, must have committed great iniquities for Lord de Winter to

she, placing her hand modestly over her beautiful eyes, â€œnever!
NA
NA
Milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young
man took for doubt, but which, however, was nothing but observation, or
rather the wish to fascinate.
Felton, in his turn a suppliant, clasped his hands.
NA
At this moment the steps of Lord de Winter were heard; but this time the
terrible brother-in-law of Milady did not content himself, as on the
preceding day, with passing before the door and going away again. He
paused, exchanged two words with the sentinel; then the door opened, and
he appeared.
During the exchange of these two words Felton drew back quickly, and
when Lord de Winter entered, he was several paces from the prisoner.
The baron entered slowly, sending a scrutinizing glance from Milady to
the young officer.

Felton lowered his head and reflected.
The baron took the young officer by the arm, and turned his head over
his shoulder, so as not to lose sight of Milady till he was gone out.
NA
advanced as I believed. De Winter has changed his usual stupidity into a
strange prudence. It is the desire of vengeance, and how desire molds a
man! As to Felton, he hesitates. Ah, he is not a man like that cursed

clasping his hands. A Musketeer loves women, and he loves them by

Milady waited, then, with much impatience, for she feared the day would
pass away without her seeing Felton again. At last, in an hour after the
scene we have just described, she heard someone speaking in a low voice
at the door. Presently the door opened, and she perceived Felton.
The young man advanced rapidly into the chamber, leaving the door open
behind him, and making a sign to Milady to be silent; his face was much
agitated.

NA

And he darted out of the room, shut the door, and waited in the
corridor, the soldierâ€™s half-pike in his hand, and as if he had mounted
guard in his place.
The soldier returned, and Felton gave him back his weapon.
Then, through the grating to which she had drawn near, Milady saw the
young man make a sign with delirious fervor, and depart in an apparent
transport of joy.
As for her, she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt
upon her lips, and repeated, blaspheming, that terrible name of God, by
whom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know Him.

56 CAPTIVITY: THE FIFTH DAY
Milady had however achieved a half-triumph, and success doubled her
forces.
It was not difficult to conquer, as she had hitherto done, men prompt to
let themselves be seduced, and whom the gallant education of a court led
quickly into her net. Milady was handsome enough not to find much
resistance on the part of the flesh, and she was sufficiently skillful
to prevail over all the obstacles of the mind.
But this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature, concentrated
and insensible by force of austerity. Religion and its observances had
made Felton a man inaccessible to ordinary seductions. There fermented
in that sublimated brain plans so vast, projects so tumultuous, that
there remained no room for any capricious or material love--that
sentiment which is fed by leisure and grows with corruption. Milady had,
then, made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a man horribly
prejudiced against her, and by her beauty in the heart of a man hitherto
chaste and pure. In short, she had taken the measure of motives hitherto
unknown to herself, through this experiment, made upon the most
rebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to her study.
Many a time, nevertheless, during the evening she despaired of fate and
of herself. She did not invoke God, we very well know, but she had faith
in the genius of evil--that immense sovereignty which reigns in all the
details of human life, and by which, as in the Arabian fable, a single
pomegranate seed is sufficient to reconstruct a ruined world.
Milady, being well prepared for the reception of Felton, was able to
erect her batteries for the next day. She knew she had only two days
left; that when once the order was signed by Buckingham--and Buckingham
would sign it the more readily from its bearing a false name, and he
could not, therefore, recognize the woman in question--once this order
was signed, we say, the baron would make her embark immediately, and she
knew very well that women condemned to exile employ arms much less
powerful in their seductions than the pretendedly virtuous woman whose
beauty is lighted by the sun of the world, whose style the voice of
fashion lauds, and whom a halo of aristocracy gilds with enchanting
splendors. To be a woman condemned to a painful and disgraceful
punishment is no impediment to beauty, but it is an obstacle to the
recovery of power. Like all persons of real genius, Milady knew what
suited her nature and her means. Poverty was repugnant to her;
degradation took away two-thirds of her greatness. Milady was only a
queen while among queens. The pleasure of satisfied pride was necessary
to her domination. To command inferior beings was rather a humiliation
than a pleasure for her.
She should certainly return from her exile--she did not doubt that a
single instant; but how long might this exile last? For an active,
ambitious nature, like that of Milady, days not spent in climbing are
inauspicious days. What word, then, can be found to describe the days
which they occupy in descending? To lose a year, two years, three years,
is to talk of an eternity; to return after the death or disgrace of the
cardinal, perhaps; to return when dâ€™Artagnan and his friends, happy and
triumphant, should have received from the queen the reward they had well
acquired by the services they had rendered her--these were devouring
ideas that a woman like Milady could not endure. For the rest, the storm
which raged within her doubled her strength, and she would have burst
the walls of her prison if her body had been able to take for a single
instant the proportions of her mind.
Then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was
the remembrance of the cardinal. What must the mistrustful, restless,
suspicious cardinal think of her silence--the cardinal, not merely her
only support, her only prop, her only protector at present, but still
further, the principal instrument of her future fortune and vengeance?
She knew him; she knew that at her return from a fruitless journey it
would be in vain to tell him of her imprisonment, in vain to enlarge
upon the sufferings she had undergone. The cardinal would reply, with
the sarcastic calmness of the skeptic, strong at once by power and
NA
Then Milady collected all her energies, murmuring in the depths of her
soul the name of Felton--the only beam of light that penetrated to her
in the hell into which she had fallen; and like a serpent which folds
and unfolds its rings to ascertain its strength, she enveloped Felton
beforehand in the thousand meshes of her inventive imagination.
Time, however, passed away; the hours, one after another, seemed to
awaken the clock as they passed, and every blow of the brass hammer
resounded upon the heart of the prisoner. At nine oâ€™clock, Lord de
Winter made his customary visit, examined the window and the bars,
sounded the floor and the walls, looked to the chimney and the doors,
without, during this long and minute examination, he or Milady
pronouncing a single word.
Doubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too
serious to lose time in useless words and aimless wrath.
NA
At ten oâ€™clock Felton came and placed the sentinel. Milady recognized
his step. She was as well acquainted with it now as a mistress is with
that of the lover of her heart; and yet Milady at the same time detested
and despised this weak fanatic.
That was not the appointed hour. Felton did not enter.
Two hours after, as midnight sounded, the sentinel was relieved. This
time it WAS the hour, and from this moment Milady waited with
impatience. The new sentinel commenced his walk in the corridor. At the
expiration of ten minutes Felton came.
Milady was all attention.

Felton offered the weapon to Milady, who examined the temper of it
attentively, and who tried the point on the tip of her finger.

Milady followed him with her eyes, and made a gesture of satisfaction.

Ambushes and violences multiplied around me, but I resisted. The

that religion and that God, but still I resisted. Then outrages were
heaped upon me, and as my soul was not subdued they wished to defile my

Milady stopped, and a bitter smile passed over her lips.

â€œAt length, one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he
could not conquer. One evening he mixed a powerful narcotic with my
water. Scarcely had I finished my repast, when I felt myself sink by
degrees into a strange torpor. Although I was without mistrust, a vague
fear seized me, and I tried to struggle against sleepiness. I arose. I
wished to run to the window and call for help, but my legs refused their
office. It appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and crushed me
with its weight. I stretched out my arms. I tried to speak. I could only
utter inarticulate sounds, and irresistible faintness came over me. I
supported myself by a chair, feeling that I was about to fall, but this
support was soon insufficient on account of my weak arms. I fell upon
one knee, then upon both. I tried to pray, but my tongue was frozen. God
doubtless neither heard nor saw me, and I sank upon the floor a prey to
a slumber which resembled death.
â€œOf all that passed in that sleep, or the time which glided away while
it lasted, I have no remembrance. The only thing I recollect is that I
awoke in bed in a round chamber, the furniture of which was sumptuous,
and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling. No
door gave entrance to the room. It might be called a magnificent prison.
â€œIt was a long time before I was able to make out what place I was in,
or to take account of the details I describe. My mind appeared to strive
in vain to shake off the heavy darkness of the sleep from which I could
not rouse myself. I had vague perceptions of space traversed, of the
rolling of a carriage, of a horrible dream in which my strength had
become exhausted; but all this was so dark and so indistinct in my mind
that these events seemed to belong to another life than mine, and yet
mixed with mine in fantastic duality.
â€œAt times the state into which I had fallen appeared so strange that I
believed myself dreaming. I arose trembling. My clothes were near me on
a chair; I neither remembered having undressed myself nor going to bed.
Then by degrees the reality broke upon me, full of chaste terrors. I was
no longer in the house where I had dwelt. As well as I could judge by
the light of the sun, the day was already two-thirds gone. It was the
evening before when I had fallen asleep; my sleep, then, must have
lasted twenty-four hours! What had taken place during this long sleep?
â€œI dressed myself as quickly as possible; my slow and stiff motions all
attested that the effects of the narcotic were not yet entirely
dissipated. The chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a
woman; and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish, but
on casting her eyes about the apartment, she would have found that wish
accomplished.
â€œCertainly I was not the first captive that had been shut up in this
splendid prison; but you may easily comprehend, Felton, that the more
superb the prison, the greater was my terror.
â€œYes, it was a prison, for I tried in vain to get out of it. I sounded
all the walls, in the hopes of discovering a door, but everywhere the
walls returned a full and flat sound.
â€œI made the tour of the room at least twenty times, in search of an
outlet of some kind; but there was none. I sank exhausted with fatigue
and terror into an armchair.
â€œMeantime, night came on rapidly, and with night my terrors increased. I
did not know but I had better remain where I was seated. It appeared
that I was surrounded with unknown dangers into which I was about to
fall at every instant. Although I had eaten nothing since the evening
before, my fears prevented my feeling hunger.
â€œNo noise from without by which I could measure the time reached me; I
only supposed it must be seven or eight oâ€™clock in the evening, for it
was in the month of October and it was quite dark.
â€œAll at once the noise of a door, turning on its hinges, made me start.
A globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling,
casting a strong light into my chamber; and I perceived with terror that
a man was standing within a few paces of me.
â€œA table, with two covers, bearing a supper ready prepared, stood, as if
by magic, in the middle of the apartment.
â€œThat man was he who had pursued me during a whole year, who had vowed
my dishonor, and who, by the first words that issued from his mouth,
NA
NA
NA
officer, whose soul seemed to hang on her lips, took in this strange
recital. â€œOh, yes, scoundrel! He believed, having triumphed over me in
my sleep, that all was completed. He came, hoping that I would accept my
shame, as my shame was consummated; he came to offer his fortune in
exchange for my love.
â€œAll that the heart of a woman could contain of haughty contempt and
disdainful words, I poured out upon this man. Doubtless he was
accustomed to such reproaches, for he listened to me calm and smiling,
with his arms crossed over his breast. Then, when he thought I had said
all, he advanced toward me; I sprang toward the table, I seized a knife,
I placed it to my breast.
NA
NA
â€œThere was, no doubt, in my look, my voice, my whole person, that
sincerity of gesture, of attitude, of accent, which carries conviction
to the most perverse minds, for he paused.
â€œâ€˜Your death?â€™ said he; â€˜oh, no, you are too charming a mistress to
allow me to consent to lose you thus, after I have had the happiness to
possess you only a single time. Adieu, my charmer; I will wait to pay
you my next visit till you are in a better humor.â€™
â€œAt these words he blew a whistle; the globe of fire which lighted the
room reascended and disappeared. I found myself again in complete
darkness. The same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated the
instant afterward; the flaming globe descended afresh, and I was
completely alone.
â€œThis moment was frightful; if I had any doubts as to my misfortune,
these doubts had vanished in an overwhelming reality. I was in the power
of a man whom I not only detested, but despised--of a man capable of
anything, and who had already given me a fatal proof of what he was able
NA
NA
â€œI passed the night on a chair, starting at the least noise, for toward
midnight the lamp went out, and I was again in darkness. But the night
passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecutor. Day
came; the table had disappeared, only I had still the knife in my hand.
â€œThis knife was my only hope.
â€œI was worn out with fatigue. Sleeplessness inflamed my eyes; I had not
dared to sleep a single instant. The light of day reassured me; I went
and threw myself on the bed, without parting with the emancipating
knife, which I concealed under my pillow.
â€œWhen I awoke, a fresh meal was served.
â€œThis time, in spite of my terrors, in spite of my agony, I began to
feel a devouring hunger. It was forty-eight hours since I had taken any
nourishment. I ate some bread and some fruit; then, remembering the
narcotic mixed with the water I had drunk, I would not touch that which
was placed on the table, but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed
in the wall over my dressing table.
â€œAnd yet, notwithstanding these precautions, I remained for some time in
a terrible agitation of mind. But my fears were this time ill-founded; I
passed the day without experiencing anything of the kind I dreaded.
â€œI took the precaution to half empty the carafe, in order that my
suspicions might not be noticed.
â€œThe evening came on, and with it darkness; but however profound was
this darkness, my eyes began to accustom themselves to it. I saw, amid
the shadows, the table sink through the floor; a quarter of an hour
later it reappeared, bearing my supper. In an instant, thanks to the
lamp, my chamber was once more lighted.
â€œI was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have
anything soporific introduced into them. Two eggs and some fruit
composed my repast; then I drew another glass of water from my
protecting fountain, and drank it.
â€œAt the first swallow, it appeared to me not to have the same taste as
in the morning. Suspicion instantly seized me. I paused, but I had
already drunk half a glass.
â€œI threw the rest away with horror, and waited, with the dew of fear
upon my brow.
â€œNo doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that
fountain, and had taken advantage of my confidence in it, the better to
assure my ruin, so coolly resolved upon, so cruelly pursued.
â€œHalf an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear; but
as I had only drunk half a glass of the water, I contended longer, and
instead of falling entirely asleep, I sank into a state of drowsiness
which left me a perception of what was passing around me, while
depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly.
â€œI dragged myself toward the bed, to seek the only defense I had
left--my saving knife; but I could not reach the bolster. I sank on my
knees, my hands clasped round one of the bedposts; then I felt that I

Felton became frightfully pale, and a convulsive tremor crept through

if she still experienced the same agony as at that awful minute, â€œwas
that at this time I retained a consciousness of the danger that
threatened me; was that my soul, if I may say so, waked in my sleeping
body; was that I saw, that I heard. It is true that all was like a
dream, but it was not the less frightful.
â€œI saw the lamp ascend, and leave me in darkness; then I heard the
well-known creaking of the door although I had heard that door open but
twice.
â€œI felt instinctively that someone approached me; it is said that the
doomed wretch in the deserts of America thus feels the approach of the
serpent.
â€œI wished to make an effort; I attempted to cry out. By an incredible
effort of will I even raised myself up, but only to sink down again
NA
NA
Milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in
Felton by dwelling on every detail of her recital; but she would not
spare him a single pang. The more profoundly she wounded his heart, the
more certainly he would avenge her. She continued, then, as if she had
not heard his exclamation, or as if she thought the moment was not yet
come to reply to it.
â€œOnly this time it was no longer an inert body, without feeling, that
the villain had to deal with. I have told you that without being able to
regain the complete exercise of my faculties, I retained the sense of my
danger. I struggled, then, with all my strength, and doubtless opposed,
weak as I was, a long resistance, for I heard him cry out, â€˜These
miserable Puritans! I knew very well that they tired out their
executioners, but I did not believe them so strong against their
lovers!â€™
â€œAlas! this desperate resistance could not last long. I felt my strength
fail, and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the coward to

Felton listened without uttering any word or sound, except an inward
expression of agony. The sweat streamed down his marble forehead, and
his hand, under his coat, tore his breast.
â€œMy first impulse, on coming to myself, was to feel under my pillow for
the knife I had not been able to reach; if it had not been useful for
defense, it might at least serve for expiation.
â€œBut on taking this knife, Felton, a terrible idea occurred to me. I
have sworn to tell you all, and I will tell you all. I have promised you

â€œThe idea came into your mind to avenge yourself on this man, did it

â€œOh, I resolved that it should take place as soon as possible. I had no
doubt he would return the following night. During the day I had nothing
to fear.
â€œWhen the hour of breakfast came, therefore, I did not hesitate to eat
and drink. I had determined to make believe sup, but to eat nothing. I
was forced, then, to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment
of the morning.
â€œOnly I concealed a glass of water, which remained after my breakfast,
thirst having been the chief of my sufferings when I remained
forty-eight hours without eating or drinking.
â€œThe day passed away without having any other influence on me than to
strengthen the resolution I had formed; only I took care that my face
should not betray the thoughts of my heart, for I had no doubt I was
watched. Several times, even, I felt a smile on my lips. Felton, I dare

NA
NA
â€œEvening came; the ordinary events took place. During the darkness, as
before, my supper was brought. Then the lamp was lighted, and I sat down
to table. I only ate some fruit. I pretended to pour out water from the
jug, but I only drank that which I had saved in my glass. The
substitution was made so carefully that my spies, if I had any, could
have no suspicion of it.
â€œAfter supper I exhibited the same marks of languor as on the preceding
evening; but this time, as I yielded to fatigue, or as if I had become
familiarized with danger, I dragged myself toward my bed, let my robe
fall, and lay down.
â€œI found my knife where I had placed it, under my pillow, and while
feigning to sleep, my hand grasped the handle of it convulsively.
â€œTwo hours passed away without anything fresh happening. Oh, my God! who
could have said so the evening before? I began to fear that he would not
come.
â€œAt length I saw the lamp rise softly, and disappear in the depths of
the ceiling; my chamber was filled with darkness and obscurity, but I
made a strong effort to penetrate this darkness and obscurity.
â€œNearly ten minutes passed; I heard no other noise but the beating of my
own heart. I implored heaven that he might come.
â€œAt length I heard the well-known noise of the door, which opened and
shut; I heard, notwithstanding the thickness of the carpet, a step which
made the floor creak; I saw, notwithstanding the darkness, a shadow

NA
NA
to my mind that the moment of vengeance, or rather, of justice, had
struck. I looked upon myself as another Judith; I gathered myself up, my
knife in my hand, and when I saw him near me, stretching out his arms to
find his victim, then, with the last cry of agony and despair, I struck
him in the middle of his breast.
â€œThe miserable villain! He had foreseen all. His breast was covered with
a coat-of-mail; the knife was bent against it.
â€œâ€˜Ah, ah!â€™ cried he, seizing my arm, and wresting from me the weapon
that had so badly served me, â€˜you want to take my life, do you, my
pretty Puritan? But thatâ€™s more than dislike, thatâ€™s ingratitude! Come,
come, calm yourself, my sweet girl! I thought you had softened. I am not
one of those tyrants who detain women by force. You donâ€™t love me. With
my usual fatuity I doubted it; now I am convinced. Tomorrow you shall be
free.â€™
â€œI had but one wish; that was that he should kill me.
â€œâ€˜Beware!â€™ said I, â€˜for my liberty is your dishonor.â€™
â€œâ€˜Explain yourself, my pretty sibyl!â€™
â€œâ€˜Yes; for as soon as I leave this place I will tell everything. I will
proclaim the violence you have used toward me. I will describe my
captivity. I will denounce this place of infamy. You are placed on high,
my Lord, but tremble! Above you there is the king; above the king there
is God!â€™
â€œHowever perfect master he was over himself, my persecutor allowed a
movement of anger to escape him. I could not see the expression of his
countenance, but I felt the arm tremble upon which my hand was placed.
â€œâ€˜Then you shall not leave this place,â€™ said he.
â€œâ€˜Very well,â€™ cried I, â€˜then the place of my punishment will be that of
my tomb. I will die here, and you will see if a phantom that accuses is
not more terrible than a living being that threatens!â€™
â€œâ€˜You shall have no weapon left in your power.â€™
â€œâ€˜There is a weapon which despair has placed within the reach of every
creature who has the courage to use it. I will allow myself to die with
hunger.â€™
â€œâ€˜Come,â€™ said the wretch, â€˜is not peace much better than such a war as
that? I will restore you to liberty this moment; I will proclaim you a
piece of immaculate virtue; I will name you the Lucretia of England.â€™
â€œâ€˜And I will say that you are the Sextus. I will denounce you before
men, as I have denounced you before God; and if it be necessary that,
like Lucretia, I should sign my accusation with my blood, I will sign
it.â€™
â€œâ€˜Ah!â€™ said my enemy, in a jeering tone, â€˜thatâ€™s quite another thing. My
faith! everything considered, you are very well off here. You shall want
for nothing, and if you let yourself die of hunger that will be your own
fault.â€™
â€œAt these words he retired. I heard the door open and shut, and I
remained overwhelmed, less, I confess it, by my grief than by the
mortification of not having avenged myself.
â€œHe kept his word. All the day, all the next night passed away without
my seeing him again. But I also kept my word with him, and I neither ate
nor drank. I was, as I told him, resolved to die of hunger.
â€œI passed the day and the night in prayer, for I hoped that God would
pardon me my suicide.
â€œThe second night the door opened; I was lying on the floor, for my
strength began to abandon me.
â€œAt the noise I raised myself up on one hand.
â€œâ€˜Well,â€™ said a voice which vibrated in too terrible a manner in my ear
not to be recognized, â€˜well! Are we softened a little? Will we not pay
for our liberty with a single promise of silence? Come, I am a good sort
of a prince,â€™ added he, â€˜and although I like not Puritans I do them
justice; and it is the same with Puritanesses, when they are pretty.
Come, take a little oath for me on the cross; I wonâ€™t ask anything more
of you.â€™
â€œâ€˜On the cross,â€™ cried I, rising, for at that abhorred voice I had
recovered all my strength, â€˜on the cross I swear that no promise, no
menace, no force, no torture, shall close my mouth! On the cross I swear
to denounce you everywhere as a murderer, as a thief of honor, as a base
coward! On the cross I swear, if I ever leave this place, to call down
vengeance upon you from the whole human race!â€™
â€œâ€˜Beware!â€™ said the voice, in a threatening accent that I had never yet
heard. â€˜I have an extraordinary means which I will not employ but in the
last extremity to close your mouth, or at least to prevent anyone from
believing a word you may utter.â€™
â€œI mustered all my strength to reply to him with a burst of laughter.
â€œHe saw that it was a merciless war between us--a war to the death.
â€œâ€˜Listen!â€™ said he. â€˜I give you the rest of tonight and all day
tomorrow. Reflect: promise to be silent, and riches, consideration, even
honor, shall surround you; threaten to speak, and I will condemn you to
infamy.â€™
â€œâ€˜You?â€™ cried I. â€˜You?â€™
â€œâ€˜To interminable, ineffaceable infamy!â€™
â€œâ€˜You?â€™ repeated I. Oh, I declare to you, Felton, I thought him mad!
â€œâ€˜Yes, yes, I!â€™ replied he.
â€œâ€˜Oh, leave me!â€™ said I. â€˜Begone, if you do not desire to see me dash my
head against that wall before your eyes!â€™
â€œâ€˜Very well, it is your own doing. Till tomorrow evening, then!â€™

Felton leaned for support upon a piece of furniture; and Milady saw,
with the joy of a demon, that his strength would fail him perhaps before
the end of her recital.
57 MEANS FOR CLASSICAL TRAGEDY
After a moment of silence employed by Milady in observing the young man
who listened to her, Milady continued her recital.
â€œIt was nearly three days since I had eaten or drunk anything. I
suffered frightful torments. At times there passed before me clouds
which pressed my brow, which veiled my eyes; this was delirium.
â€œWhen the evening came I was so weak that every time I fainted I thanked
God, for I thought I was about to die.
â€œIn the midst of one of these swoons I heard the door open. Terror
recalled me to myself.
â€œHe entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask. He was masked
likewise; but I knew his step, I knew his voice, I knew him by that
imposing bearing which hell has bestowed upon his person for the curse
of humanity.
â€œâ€˜Well,â€™ said he to me, â€˜have you made your mind up to take the oath I
requested of you?â€™
â€œâ€˜You have said Puritans have but one word. Mine you have heard, and
that is to pursue you--on earth to the tribunal of men, in heaven to the
tribunal of God.â€™
â€œâ€˜You persist, then?â€™
â€œâ€˜I swear it before the God who hears me. I will take the whole world as
a witness of your crime, and that until I have found an avenger.â€™
â€œâ€˜You are a prostitute,â€™ said he, in a voice of thunder, â€˜and you shall
undergo the punishment of prostitutes! Branded in the eyes of the world
you invoke, try to prove to that world that you are neither guilty nor
mad!â€™
â€œThen, addressing the man who accompanied him, â€˜Executioner,â€™ said he,

NA
â€œThen in spite of my cries, in spite of my resistance--for I began to
comprehend that there was a question of something worse than death--the
executioner seized me, threw me on the floor, fastened me with his
bonds, and suffocated by sobs, almost without sense, invoking God, who
did not listen to me, I uttered all at once a frightful cry of pain and
shame. A burning fire, a red-hot iron, the iron of the executioner, was

This was too much for Felton.
Pale, motionless, overwhelmed by this frightful revelation, dazzled by
the superhuman beauty of this woman who unveiled herself before him with
an immodesty which appeared to him sublime, he ended by falling on his
knees before her as the early Christians did before those pure and holy
martyrs whom the persecution of the emperors gave up in the circus to
the sanguinary sensuality of the populace. The brand disappeared; the
beauty alone remained.

Milady read in his eyes LOVE! LOVE!

kisses.
Milady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a

Felton was a Puritan; he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her
feet.
He no longer loved her; he adored her.
When this crisis was past, when Milady appeared to have resumed her
self-possession, which she had never lost; when Felton had seen her
recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were
only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently, he
said, â€œAh, now! I have only one thing to ask of you; that is, the name
of your true executioner. For to me there is but one; the other was an
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
persecutor of true believers, the base ravisher of the honor of so many
women--he who, to satisfy a caprice of his corrupt heart, is about to
make England shed so much blood, who protects the Protestants today and
NA
NA
excitement.
Milady concealed her face in her hands, as if she could not endure the
shame which this name recalled to her.
NA
â€œAnd thou hast not hurled thy thunder at him, my God! And thou hast left
NA
NA
NA
said Felton, with increasing exultation. â€œHe wills that human vengeance
NA
NA
NA
The soul of Milady was bathed in an infernal joy.
NA
NA
NA
contemptible men there are often found great and generous natures. I had
an affianced husband, a man whom I loved, and who loved me--a heart like
yours, Felton, a man like you. I went to him and told him all; he knew
me, that man did, and did not doubt an instant. He was a nobleman, a man
equal to Buckingham in every respect. He said nothing; he only girded on
his sword, wrapped himself in his cloak, and went straight to Buckingham
Palace.
NA
NA
â€œBuckingham had left England the day before, sent as ambassador to
Spain, to demand the hand of the Infanta for King Charles I, who was
then only Prince of Wales. My affianced husband returned.
â€œâ€˜Hear me,â€™ said he; â€˜this man has gone, and for the moment has
consequently escaped my vengeance; but let us be united, as we were to
have been, and then leave it to Lord de Winter to maintain his own honor
NA
NA
NA
can you not? Buckingham remained nearly a year absent. A week before his
return Lord de Winter died, leaving me his sole heir. Whence came the
blow? God who knows all, knows without doubt; but as for me, I accuse
NA
NA
â€œLord de Winter died without revealing anything to his brother. The
terrible secret was to be concealed till it burst, like a clap of
thunder, over the head of the guilty. Your protector had seen with pain
this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless girl. I was
sensible that I could look for no support from a man disappointed in his
hopes of an inheritance. I went to France, with a determination to
remain there for the rest of my life. But all my fortune is in England.
Communication being closed by the war, I was in want of everything. I
was then obliged to come back again. Six days ago, I landed at
NA
NA
â€œWell; Buckingham heard by some means, no doubt, of my return. He spoke
of me to Lord de Winter, already prejudiced against me, and told him
that his sister-in-law was a prostitute, a branded woman. The noble and
pure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend me. Lord de Winter
believed all that was told him with so much the more ease that it was
his interest to believe it. He caused me to be arrested, had me
conducted hither, and placed me under your guard. You know the rest. The
day after tomorrow he banishes me, he transports me; the day after
tomorrow he exiles me among the infamous. Oh, the train is well laid;
the plot is clever. My honor will not survive it! You see, then, Felton,
NA
And at these words, as if all her strength was exhausted, Milady sank,
weak and languishing, into the arms of the young officer, who,
intoxicated with love, anger, and voluptuous sensations hitherto
unknown, received her with transport, pressed her against his heart, all
trembling at the breath from that charming mouth, bewildered by the
contact with that palpitating bosom.
NA
NA
Milady put him from her slowly with her hand, while drawing him nearer
with her look; but Felton, in his turn, embraced her more closely,
imploring her like a divinity.
NA
NA
NA
â€œFelton, I bring misfortune to all who surround me! Felton, abandon me!
NA
NA
to those of the prisoner.
Several strokes resounded on the door; this time Milady really pushed
him away from her.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Felton obeyed; this woman was now his whole thought, his whole soul.
He found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a watch-patrol.
NA
NA
soldier; â€œbut you forgot to leave me the key. I heard you cry out,
without understanding what you said. I tried to open the door, but it

NA
Felton, quite bewildered, almost mad, stood speechless.
Milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the
scene. She ran to the table, and seizing the knife which Felton had laid
NA
NA
At that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the
corridor. The baron, attracted by the noise, in his chamber gown, his
sword under his arm, stood in the doorway.
NA
Felton, the drama has gone through all the phases I named; but be easy,
NA
Milady perceived that all was lost unless she gave Felton an immediate
and terrible proof of her courage.
â€œYou are mistaken, my Lord, blood will flow; and may that blood fall
NA
Felton uttered a cry, and rushed toward her. He was too late; Milady had
stabbed herself.
But the knife had fortunately, we ought to say skillfully, come in
contact with the steel busk, which at that period, like a cuirass,
defended the chests of women. It had glided down it, tearing the robe,
and had penetrated slantingly between the flesh and the ribs. Miladyâ€™s
robe was not the less stained with blood in a second.
Milady fell down, and seemed to be in a swoon.
Felton snatched away the knife.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
At this injunction from his superior, Felton obeyed; but in going out,
he put the knife into his bosom.
As to Lord de Winter, he contented himself with calling the woman who
waited on Milady, and when she was come, he recommended the prisoner,
who was still fainting, to her care, and left them alone.
Meanwhile, all things considered and notwithstanding his suspicions, as
the wound might be serious, he immediately sent off a mounted man to
find a physician.
58 ESCAPE
As Lord de Winter had thought, Miladyâ€™s wound was not dangerous. So soon
as she was left alone with the woman whom the baron had summoned to her
assistance she opened her eyes.
It was, however, necessary to affect weakness and pain--not a very
difficult task for so finished an actress as Milady. Thus the poor woman
was completely the dupe of the prisoner, whom, notwithstanding her
hints, she persisted in watching all night.
But the presence of this woman did not prevent Milady from thinking.
There was no longer a doubt that Felton was convinced; Felton was hers.
If an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of Milady, he would
take him, in the mental disposition in which he now found himself, for a
messenger sent by the devil.
Milady smiled at this thought, for Felton was now her only hope--her
only means of safety.
But Lord de Winter might suspect him; Felton himself might now be
watched!
Toward four oâ€™clock in the morning the doctor arrived; but since the
time Milady stabbed herself, however short, the wound had closed. The
doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of
it; he only satisfied himself by Miladyâ€™s pulse that the case was not
serious.
In the morning Milady, under the pretext that she had not slept well in
the night and wanted rest, sent away the woman who attended her.
She had one hope, which was that Felton would appear at the breakfast
hour; but Felton did not come.
Were her fears realized? Was Felton, suspected by the baron, about to
fail her at the decisive moment? She had only one day left. Lord de
Winter had announced her embarkation for the twenty-third, and it was
now the morning of the twenty-second.
Nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner.
Although she had eaten nothing in the morning, the dinner was brought in
at its usual time. Milady then perceived, with terror, that the uniform
of the soldiers who guarded her was changed.
Then she ventured to ask what had become of Felton.
She was told that he had left the castle an hour before on horseback.
She inquired if the baron was still at the castle. The soldier replied
that he was, and that he had given orders to be informed if the prisoner
wished to speak to him.
Milady replied that she was too weak at present, and that her only
desire was to be left alone.
The soldier went out, leaving the dinner served.
Felton was sent away. The marines were removed. Felton was then
mistrusted.
This was the last blow to the prisoner.
Left alone, she arose. The bed, which she had kept from prudence and
that they might believe her seriously wounded, burned her like a bed of
fire. She cast a glance at the door; the baron had had a plank nailed
over the grating. He no doubt feared that by this opening she might
still by some diabolical means corrupt her guards.
Milady smiled with joy. She was free now to give way to her transports
without being observed. She traversed her chamber with the excitement of
a furious maniac or of a tigress shut up in an iron cage. CERTES, if the
knife had been left in her power, she would now have thought, not of
killing herself, but of killing the baron.
At six oâ€™clock Lord de Winter came in. He was armed at all points. This
man, in whom Milady till that time had only seen a very simple
gentleman, had become an admirable jailer. He appeared to foresee all,
to divine all, to anticipate all.
A single look at Milady apprised him of all that was passing in her
mind.
NA
longer a weapon; and besides, I am on my guard. You had begun to pervert
my poor Felton. He was yielding to your infernal influence; but I will
save him. He will never see you again; all is over. Get your clothes
together. Tomorrow you will go. I had fixed the embarkation for the
twenty-fourth; but I have reflected that the more promptly the affair
takes place the more sure it will be. Tomorrow, by twelve oâ€™clock, I
shall have the order for your exile, signed, BUCKINGHAM. If you speak a
single word to anyone before going aboard ship, my sergeant will blow
your brains out. He has orders to do so. If when on the ship you speak a
single word to anyone before the captain permits you, the captain will
have you thrown into the sea. That is agreed upon.
â€œAU REVOIR; then; that is all I have to say today. Tomorrow I will see
NA
Milady had listened to all this menacing tirade with a smile of disdain
on her lips, but rage in her heart.
Supper was served. Milady felt that she stood in need of all her
strength. She did not know what might take place during this night which
approached so menacingly--for large masses of cloud rolled over the face
of the sky, and distant lightning announced a storm.
The storm broke about ten oâ€™clock. Milady felt a consolation in seeing
nature partake of the disorder of her heart. The thunder growled in the
air like the passion and anger in her thoughts. It appeared to her that
the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow, as it bowed the
branches of the trees and bore away their leaves. She howled as the
hurricane howled; and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature,
which also seemed to groan with despair.
All at once she heard a tap at her window, and by the help of a flash of
lightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the bars.
She ran to the window and opened it.
NA
NA
through these bars. Only take care that I am not seen through the
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œNothing, nothing, only shut the window. Go to bed, or at least lie down
in your clothes. As soon as I have done I will knock on one of the panes
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Milady shut the window, extinguished the lamp, and went, as Felton had
desired her, to lie down on the bed. Amid the moaning of the storm she
heard the grinding of the file upon the bars, and by the light of every
flash she perceived the shadow of Felton through the panes.
She passed an hour without breathing, panting, with a cold sweat upon
her brow, and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement
she heard in the corridor.
There are hours which last a year.
At the expiration of an hour, Felton tapped again.
Milady sprang out of bed and opened the window. Two bars removed formed
an opening for a man to pass through.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œSo much the better, for I have expended all mine in chartering a
NA
NA
Felton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the wall.
NA
NA
Milady mounted upon a chair and passed the upper part of her body
through the window. She saw the young officer suspended over the abyss
by a ladder of ropes. For the first time an emotion of terror reminded
her that she was a woman.
The dark space frightened her.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Felton tied her two wrists together with his handkerchief, and then with
a cord over the handkerchief.
NA
NA
â€œBut I shall make you lose your balance, and we shall both be dashed to
NA
NA
Not a second was to be lost. Milady passed her two arms round Feltonâ€™s
neck, and let herself slip out of the window. Felton began to descend
the ladder slowly, step by step. Despite the weight of two bodies, the
blast of the hurricane shook them in the air.
All at once Felton stopped.
NA
NA
NA
There was a silence of several seconds.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Both remained suspended, motionless and breathless, within twenty paces
of the ground, while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and
talking. This was a terrible moment for the fugitives.
The patrol passed. The noise of their retreating footsteps and the
murmur of their voices soon died away.
NA
Milady breathed a deep sigh and fainted.
Felton continued to descend. Near the bottom of the ladder, when he
found no more support for his feet, he clung with his hands; at length,
arrived at the last step, he let himself hang by the strength of his
wrists, and touched the ground. He stooped down, picked up the bag of
money, and placed it between his teeth. Then he took Milady in his arms,
and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol
had taken. He soon left the pathway of the patrol, descended across the
rocks, and when arrived on the edge of the sea, whistled.
A similar signal replied to him; and five minutes after, a boat
appeared, rowed by four men.
The boat approached as near as it could to the shore; but there was not
depth enough of water for it to touch land. Felton walked into the sea
up to his middle, being unwilling to trust his precious burden to
anybody.
Fortunately the storm began to subside, but still the sea was disturbed.
The little boat bounded over the waves like a nut-shell.
NA
The four men bent to their oars, but the sea was too high to let them
get much hold of it.
However, they left the castle behind; that was the principal thing. The
night was extremely dark. It was almost impossible to see the shore from
the boat; they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from the
shore.
A black point floated on the sea. That was the sloop. While the boat was
advancing with all the speed its four rowers could give it, Felton
untied the cord and then the handkerchief which bound Miladyâ€™s hands
together. When her hands were loosed he took some sea water and
sprinkled it over her face.
Milady breathed a sigh, and opened her eyes.
NA
NA
NA
NA
The young man pressed her to his heart.
NA
NA
Milady held out her arms; her wrists were bruised.
NA
head sorrowfully.
NA
Milady looked around her, as if in search of something.

They drew near to the sloop. A sailor on watch hailed the boat; the boat
replied.

NA
NA
NA
NA
Milady started with joy. She could read to the depths of the heart of
this young man; the death of Buckingham was written there at full
length.
NA
NA
NA
In fact, they touched the sloop.
Felton mounted the ladder first, and gave his hand to Milady, while the
sailors supported her, for the sea was still much agitated.
An instant after they were on the deck.

The captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers, and toward
seven oâ€™clock in the morning the little vessel cast anchor in the bay
that had been named.
During this passage, Felton related everything to Milady--how, instead
of going to London, he had chartered the little vessel; how he had
returned; how he had scaled the wall by fastening cramps in the
interstices of the stones, as he ascended, to give him foothold; and
how, when he had reached the bars, he fastened his ladder. Milady knew
the rest.
On her side, Milady tried to encourage Felton in his project; but at the
first words which issued from her mouth, she plainly saw that the young
fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than urged.
It was agreed that Milady should wait for Felton till ten oâ€™clock; if he
did not return by ten oâ€™clock she was to sail.
In that case, and supposing he was at liberty, he was to rejoin her in
France, at the convent of the Carmelites at Bethune.
59 WHAT TOOK PLACE AT PORTSMOUTH AUGUST 23, 1628
Felton took leave of Milady as a brother about to go for a mere walk
takes leave of his sister, kissing her hand.
His whole body appeared in its ordinary state of calmness, only an
unusual fire beamed from his eyes, like the effects of a fever; his brow
was more pale than it generally was; his teeth were clenched, and his
speech had a short dry accent which indicated that something dark was at
work within him.
As long as he remained in the boat which conveyed him to land, he kept
his face toward Milady, who, standing on the deck, followed him with her
eyes. Both were free from the fear of pursuit; nobody ever came into
Miladyâ€™s apartment before nine oâ€™clock, and it would require three hours
to go from the castle to London.
Felton jumped onshore, climbed the little ascent which led to the top of
the cliff, saluted Milady a last time, and took his course toward the
city.
At the end of a hundred paces, the ground began to decline, and he could
only see the mast of the sloop.
He immediately ran in the direction of Portsmouth, which he saw at
nearly half a league before him, standing out in the haze of the
morning, with its houses and towers.
Beyond Portsmouth the sea was covered with vessels whose masts, like a
forest of poplars despoiled by the winter, bent with each breath of the
wind.
Felton, in his rapid walk, reviewed in his mind all the accusations
against the favorite of James I and Charles I, furnished by two years of
premature meditation and a long sojourn among the Puritans.
When he compared the public crimes of this minister--startling crimes,
European crimes, if so we may say--with the private and unknown crimes
with which Milady had charged him, Felton found that the more culpable
of the two men which formed the character of Buckingham was the one of
whom the public knew not the life. This was because his love, so
strange, so new, and so ardent, made him view the infamous and imaginary
accusations of Milady de Winter as, through a magnifying glass, one
views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side
of an ant.
The rapidity of his walk heated his blood still more; the idea that he
left behind him, exposed to a frightful vengeance, the woman he loved,
or rather whom he adored as a saint, the emotion he had experienced,
present fatigue--all together exalted his mind above human feeling.
He entered Portsmouth about eight oâ€™clock in the morning. The whole
population was on foot; drums were beating in the streets and in the
port; the troops about to embark were marching toward the sea.
Felton arrived at the palace of the Admiralty, covered with dust, and
streaming with perspiration. His countenance, usually so pale, was
purple with heat and passion. The sentinel wanted to repulse him; but
Felton called to the officer of the post, and drawing from his pocket
the letter of which he was the bearer, he said, â€œA pressing message from
NA
At the name of Lord de Winter, who was known to be one of his Graceâ€™s
most intimate friends, the officer of the post gave orders to let Felton
pass, who, besides, wore the uniform of a naval officer.
Felton darted into the palace.
At the moment he entered the vestibule, another man was entering
likewise, dusty, out of breath, leaving at the gate a post horse, which,
on reaching the palace, tumbled on his foreknees.
Felton and he addressed Patrick, the dukeâ€™s confidential lackey, at the
same moment. Felton named Lord de Winter; the unknown would not name
anybody, and pretended that it was to the duke alone he would make
himself known. Each was anxious to gain admission before the other.
Patrick, who knew Lord de Winter was in affairs of the service, and in
relations of friendship with the duke, gave the preference to the one
who came in his name. The other was forced to wait, and it was easily to
be seen how he cursed the delay.
The valet led Felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies
from La Rochelle, headed by the Prince de Soubise, and introduced him
into a closet where Buckingham, just out of the bath, was finishing his
toilet, upon which, as at all times, he bestowed extraordinary
attention.
NA
NA
Felton entered. At that moment Buckingham was throwing upon a couch a
rich toilet robe, worked with gold, in order to put on a blue velvet
doublet embroidered with pearls.

undoubtedly spoke in his name, and softened.

But Felton did not give him time to draw it. He held the knife with
which Milady had stabbed herself, open in his bosom; at one bound he was
upon the duke.
At that moment Patrick entered the room, crying, â€œA letter from France,
NA
NA
whom that letter came.
Felton took advantage of this moment, and plunged the knife into his
side up to the handle.
NA
NA
Felton cast his eyes round for means of escape, and seeing the door
free, he rushed into the next chamber, in which, as we have said, the
deputies from La Rochelle were waiting, crossed it as quickly as
possible, and rushed toward the staircase; but upon the first step he
met Lord de Winter, who, seeing him pale, confused, livid, and stained
with blood both on his hands and face, seized him by the throat, crying,
â€œI knew it! I guessed it! But too late by a minute, unfortunate,
NA
Felton made no resistance. Lord de Winter placed him in the hands of the
guards, who led him, while awaiting further orders, to a little terrace
commanding the sea; and then the baron hastened to the dukeâ€™s chamber.
At the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of Patrick, the man whom
Felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber.
He found the duke reclining upon a sofa, with his hand pressed upon the
wound.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œSilence, Laporte, you may be overheard. Patrick, let no one enter. Oh,
NA
And the duke swooned.
Meanwhile, Lord de Winter, the deputies, the leaders of the expedition,
the officers of Buckinghamâ€™s household, had all made their way into the
chamber. Cries of despair resounded on all sides. The news, which filled
the palace with tears and groans, soon became known, and spread itself
throughout the city.
The report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had
taken place.
Lord de Winter tore his hair.
NA
NA
He had been informed at seven oâ€™clock in the morning that a rope ladder
floated from one of the windows of the castle; he had hastened to
Miladyâ€™s chamber, had found it empty, the window open, and the bars
filed, had remembered the verbal caution dâ€™Artagnan had transmitted to
him by his messenger, had trembled for the duke, and running to the
stable without taking time to have a horse saddled, had jumped upon the
first he found, had galloped off like the wind, had alighted below in
the courtyard, had ascended the stairs precipitately, and on the top
step, as we have said, had encountered Felton.
The duke, however, was not dead. He recovered a little, reopened his
eyes, and hope revived in all hearts.

Laporte made no further objection, and read:
â€œMy Lord, By that which, since I have known you, have suffered by you
and for you, I conjure you, if you have any care for my repose, to
countermand those great armaments which you are preparing against
France, to put an end to a war of which it is publicly said religion is
the ostensible cause, and of which, it is generally whispered, your love
for me is the concealed cause. This war may not only bring great
catastrophes upon England and France, but misfortune upon you, my Lord,
for which I should never console myself.
â€œBe careful of your life, which is menaced, and which will be dear to me
from the moment I am not obliged to see an enemy in you.

Buckingham collected all his remaining strength to listen to the reading
of the letter; then, when it was ended, as if he had met with a bitter
disappointment, he asked, â€œHave you nothing else to say to me by the

of Laporte. He had just strength enough to place the scent bag at the
bottom of the silver casket, and to let the knife fall into it, making a
sign to Laporte that he was no longer able to speak; then, in a last
convulsion, which this time he had not the power to combat, he slipped
from the sofa to the floor.
Patrick uttered a loud cry.
Buckingham tried to smile a last time; but death checked his thought,
which remained engraved on his brow like a last kiss of love.
At this moment the dukeâ€™s surgeon arrived, quite terrified; he was
already on board the admiralâ€™s ship, where they had been obliged to seek
him.
He approached the duke, took his hand, held it for an instant in his

At this cry all the crowd re-entered the apartment, and throughout the
palace and town there was nothing but consternation and tumult.
As soon as Lord de Winter saw Buckingham was dead, he ran to Felton,

De Winter, stupefied, looked on while the soldiers bound Felton, and
could not tell what to think of such insensibility.
One thing alone, however, threw a shade over the pallid brow of Felton.
At every noise he heard, the simple Puritan fancied he recognized the
step and voice of Milady coming to throw herself into his arms, to
accuse herself, and die with him.
All at once he started. His eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea,
commanded by the terrace where he was. With the eagle glance of a sailor
he had recognized there, where another would have seen only a gull
hovering over the waves, the sail of a sloop which was directed toward
the coast of France.
He grew deadly pale, placed his hand upon his heart, which was breaking,
and at once perceived all the treachery.

Milady had hastened her departure by an hour and a half. As soon as she
heard the cannon which announced the fatal event, she had ordered the
anchor to be weighed. The vessel was making way under a blue sky, at
great distance from the coast.

without, however, being able to take his eyes from that ship, on board
of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of
her to whom he had sacrificed his life.

sea; â€œbut I swear to you by the memory of my brother whom I have loved

Felton lowered his head without pronouncing a syllable.
As to Lord de Winter, he descended the stairs rapidly, and went straight
to the port.
60 IN FRANCE
The first fear of the King of England, Charles I, on learning of the
death of the duke, was that such terrible news might discourage the
Rochellais; he tried, says Richelieu in his Memoirs, to conceal it from
them as long as possible, closing all the ports of his kingdom, and
carefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army which
Buckingham was getting together had gone, taking upon himself, in
default of Buckingham, to superintend the departure.
He carried the strictness of this order so far as to detain in England
the ambassadors of Denmark, who had taken their leave, and the regular
ambassador of Holland, who was to take back to the port of Flushing the
Indian merchantmen of which Charles I had made restitution to the United
Provinces.
But as he did not think of giving this order till five hours after the
event--that is to say, till two oâ€™clock in the afternoon--two vessels
had already left the port, the one bearing, as we know, Milady, who,
already anticipating the event, was further confirmed in that belief by
seeing the black flag flying at the masthead of the admiralâ€™s ship.
As to the second vessel, we will tell hereafter whom it carried, and how
it set sail.
During this time nothing new occurred in the camp at La Rochelle; only
the king, who was bored, as always, but perhaps a little more so in camp
than elsewhere, resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of St.
Louis at St. Germain, and asked the cardinal to order him an escort of
only twenty Musketeers. The cardinal, who sometimes became weary of the
king, granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his royal
lieutenant, who promised to return about the fifteenth of September.
M de Treville, being informed of this by his Eminence, packed his
portmanteau; and as without knowing the cause he knew the great desire
and even imperative need which his friends had of returning to Paris, it
goes without saying that he fixed upon them to form part of the escort.
The four young men heard the news a quarter of an hour after M. de
Treville, for they were the first to whom he communicated it. It was
then that dâ€™Artagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred
upon him in making him at last enter the Musketeers--for without that
circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his
companions left it.
It goes without saying that this impatience to return toward Paris had
for a cause the danger which Mme. Bonacieux would run of meeting at the
convent of Bethune with Milady, her mortal enemy. Aramis therefore had
written immediately to Marie Michon, the seamstress at Tours who had
such fine acquaintances, to obtain from the queen authority for Mme.
Bonacieux to leave the convent, and to retire either into Lorraine or
Belgium. They had not long to wait for an answer. Eight or ten days
afterward Aramis received the following letter:
â€œMy Dear Cousin,
â€œHere is the authorization from my sister to withdraw our little servant
from the convent of Bethune, the air of which you think is bad for her.
My sister sends you this authorization with great pleasure, for she is
very partial to the little girl, to whom she intends to be more
serviceable hereafter.
â€œI salute you,
NA
To this letter was added an order, conceived in these terms:
â€œAt the Louvre, August 10, 1628
â€œThe superior of the convent of Bethune will place in the hands of the
person who shall present this note to her the novice who entered the
convent upon my recommendation and under my patronage.
NA
It may be easily imagined how the relationship between Aramis and a
seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men; but
Aramis, after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his
eyes at the gross pleasantry of Porthos, begged his friends not to
revert to the subject again, declaring that if a single word more was
said to him about it, he would never again implore his cousins to
interfere in such affairs.
There was no further question, therefore, about Marie Michon among the
four Musketeers, who besides had what they wanted: that was, the order
to withdraw Mme. Bonacieux from the convent of the Carmelites of
Bethune. It was true that this order would not be of great use to them
while they were in camp at La Rochelle; that is to say, at the other end
of France. Therefore dâ€™Artagnan was going to ask leave of absence of M.
de Treville, confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure,
when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends
that the king was about to set out for Paris with an escort of twenty
Musketeers, and that they formed part of the escort.
Their joy was great. The lackeys were sent on before with the baggage,
and they set out on the morning of the sixteenth.
The cardinal accompanied his Majesty from Surgeres to Mauzes; and there
the king and his minister took leave of each other with great
demonstrations of friendship.
The king, however, who sought distraction, while traveling as fast as
possible--for he was anxious to be in Paris by the twenty-third--stopped
from time to time to fly the magpie, a pastime for which the taste had
been formerly inspired in him by de Luynes, and for which he had always
preserved a great predilection. Out of the twenty Musketeers sixteen,
when this took place, rejoiced greatly at this relaxation; but the other
four cursed it heartily. Dâ€™Artagnan, in particular, had a perpetual
buzzing in his ears, which Porthos explained thus: â€œA very great lady
NA
At length the escort passed through Paris on the twenty-third, in the
night. The king thanked M. de Treville, and permitted him to distribute
furloughs for four days, on condition that the favored parties should
not appear in any public place, under penalty of the Bastille.
The first four furloughs granted, as may be imagined, were to our four
friends. Still further, Athos obtained of M. de Treville six days
instead of four, and introduced into these six days two more nights--for
they set out on the twenty-fourth at five oâ€™clock in the evening, and as
a further kindness M. de Treville post-dated the leave to the morning of
the twenty-fifth.
NA
at anything. â€œIt appears to me that we are making a great trouble of a
very simple thing. In two days, and by using up two or three horses
(thatâ€™s nothing; I have plenty of money), I am at Bethune. I present my
letter from the queen to the superior, and I bring back the dear
treasure I go to seek--not into Lorraine, not into Belgium, but to
Paris, where she will be much better concealed, particularly while the
cardinal is at La Rochelle. Well, once returned from the country, half
by the protection of her cousin, half through what we have personally
done for her, we shall obtain from the queen what we desire. Remain,
then, where you are, and do not exhaust yourselves with useless fatigue.
NA
To this Athos replied quietly: â€œWe also have money left--for I have not
yet drunk all my share of the diamond, and Porthos and Aramis have not
eaten all theirs. We can therefore use up four horses as well as one.
NA
the young man shudder, â€œconsider that Bethune is a city where the
cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who, wherever she goes, brings
misery with her. If you had only to deal with four men, dâ€™Artagnan, I
would allow you to go alone. You have to do with that woman! We four
will go; and I hope to God that with our four lackeys we may be in

NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan examined the countenances of his companions, which, like that
of Athos, wore an impression of deep anxiety; and they continued their
route as fast as their horses could carry them, but without adding
another word.
On the evening of the twenty-fifth, as they were entering Arras, and as
dâ€™Artagnan was dismounting at the inn of the Golden Harrow to drink a
glass of wine, a horseman came out of the post yard, where he had just
had a relay, started off at a gallop, and with a fresh horse took the
road to Paris. At the moment he passed through the gateway into the
street, the wind blew open the cloak in which he was wrapped, although
it was in the month of August, and lifted his hat, which the traveler
seized with his hand the moment it had left his head, pulling it eagerly
over his eyes.
Dâ€™Artagnan, who had his eyes fixed upon this man, became very pale, and
let his glass fall.
NA

The three friends hastened toward dâ€™Artagnan, who, instead of being ill,
ran toward his horse. They stopped him at the door.

NA
â€œThat cursed man, my evil genius, whom I have always met with when
threatened by some misfortune, he who accompanied that horrible woman

61 THE CARMELITE CONVENT AT BETHUNE
Great criminals bear about them a kind of predestination which makes
them surmount all obstacles, which makes them escape all dangers, up to
the moment which a wearied Providence has marked as the rock of their
impious fortunes.
It was thus with Milady. She escaped the cruisers of both nations, and
arrived at Boulogne without accident.
When landing at Portsmouth, Milady was an Englishwoman whom the
persecutions of the French drove from La Rochelle; when landing at
Boulogne, after a two daysâ€™ passage, she passed for a Frenchwoman whom
the English persecuted at Portsmouth out of their hatred for France.
Milady had, likewise, the best of passports--her beauty, her noble
appearance, and the liberality with which she distributed her pistoles.
Freed from the usual formalities by the affable smile and gallant
manners of an old governor of the port, who kissed her hand, she only
remained long enough at Boulogne to put into the post a letter,
conceived in the following terms:
â€œTo his Eminence Monseigneur the Cardinal Richelieu, in his camp before
La Rochelle.
â€œMonseigneur,
Let your Eminence be reassured. His Grace the Duke of Buckingham WILL
NOT SET OUT for France.
â€œMILADY DE ----
â€œBOULOGNE, evening of the twenty-fifth.
â€œP.S.--According to the desire of your Eminence, I report to the convent
NA
Accordingly, that same evening Milady commenced her journey. Night
overtook her; she stopped, and slept at an inn. At five oâ€™clock the next
morning she again proceeded, and in three hours after entered Bethune.
She inquired for the convent of the Carmelites, and went thither
immediately.
The superior met her; Milady showed her the cardinalâ€™s order. The abbess
assigned her a chamber, and had breakfast served.
All the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman; and her looks,
fixed on the future, beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for
her by the cardinal, whom she had so successfully served without his
name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair. The ever-new
passions which consumed her gave to her life the appearance of those
clouds which float in the heavens, reflecting sometimes azure, sometimes
fire, sometimes the opaque blackness of the tempest, and which leave no
traces upon the earth behind them but devastation and death.
After breakfast, the abbess came to pay her a visit. There is very
little amusement in the cloister, and the good superior was eager to
make the acquaintance of her new boarder.
Milady wished to please the abbess. This was a very easy matter for a
woman so really superior as she was. She tried to be agreeable, and she
was charming, winning the good superior by her varied conversation and
by the graces of her whole personality.
The abbess, who was the daughter of a noble house, took particular
delight in stories of the court, which so seldom travel to the
extremities of the kingdom, and which, above all, have so much
difficulty in penetrating the walls of convents, at whose threshold the
noise of the world dies away.
Milady, on the contrary, was quite conversant with all aristocratic
intrigues, amid which she had constantly lived for five or six years.
She made it her business, therefore, to amuse the good abbess with the
worldly practices of the court of France, mixed with the eccentric
pursuits of the king; she made for her the scandalous chronicle of the
lords and ladies of the court, whom the abbess knew perfectly by name,
touched lightly on the amours of the queen and the Duke of Buckingham,
talking a great deal to induce her auditor to talk a little.
But the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without
replying a word. Milady, however, saw that this sort of narrative amused
her very much, and kept at it; only she now let her conversation drift
toward the cardinal.
But she was greatly embarrassed. She did not know whether the abbess was
a royalist or a cardinalist; she therefore confined herself to a prudent
middle course. But the abbess, on her part, maintained a reserve still
more prudent, contenting herself with making a profound inclination of
the head every time the fair traveler pronounced the name of his
Eminence.
Milady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life; she
resolved, then, to risk something in order that she might know how to
act afterward. Desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good
abbess would go, she began to tell a story, obscure at first, but very
circumstantial afterward, about the cardinal, relating the amours of the
minister with Mme. dâ€™Aiguillon, Marion de Lorme, and several other gay
women.
The abbess listened more attentively, grew animated by degrees, and
smiled.
NA
NA
She then went on to describe the persecutions exercised by the cardinal
upon his enemies. The abbess only crossed herself, without approving or
disapproving.
This confirmed Milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather royalist
than cardinalist. Milady therefore continued, coloring her narrations
more and more.
NA
however distant from the court we may be, however remote from the
interests of the world we may be placed, we have very sad examples of
what you have related. And one of our boarders has suffered much from

NA
NA
â€œAnd you have reason, for she is much to be pitied. Imprisonment,

resumed the abbess, â€œMonsieur Cardinal has perhaps plausible motives for
acting thus; and though she has the look of an angel, we must not always

NA

She tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect candor.
NA

most beautiful work of the Lord? As for me, I shall be deceived all my
life perhaps, but I shall always have faith in a person whose

NA

NA

â€œIs an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison, from which he

NA
â€œWhither should I go? Do you believe there is a spot on the earth which
the cardinal cannot reach if he takes the trouble to stretch forth his
hand? If I were a man, that would barely be possible; but what can a
NA
â€œNo, that is true; but she--that is another thing; I believe she is

NA

The abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness, as if a fresh
thought suggested itself to her mind.
NA
NA
NA
NA

power to make you cherish your captivity. You will find here, moreover,
the young woman of whom I spoke, who is persecuted, no doubt, in

â€œShe was sent to me by someone of high rank, under the name of Kitty. I

NA
NA
Milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this
might be her old chambermaid. There was connected with the remembrance
of this girl a remembrance of anger; and a desire of vengeance
disordered the features of Milady, which, however, immediately recovered
the calm and benevolent expression which this woman of a hundred faces
had for a moment allowed them to lose.
â€œAnd when can I see this young lady, for whom I already feel so great a
NA
NA
traveling these four days, as you told me yourself. This morning you
rose at five oâ€™clock; you must stand in need of repose. Go to bed and
NA
Although Milady would very willingly have gone without sleep, sustained
as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her
heart, ever thirsting for intrigues, she nevertheless accepted the offer
of the superior. During the last fifteen days she had experienced so
many and such various emotions that if her frame of iron was still
capable of supporting fatigue, her mind required repose.
She therefore took leave of the abbess, and went to bed, softly rocked
by the ideas of vengeance which the name of Kitty had naturally brought
to her thoughts. She remembered that almost unlimited promise which the
cardinal had given her if she succeeded in her enterprise. She had
succeeded; dâ€™Artagnan was then in her power!
One thing alone frightened her; that was the remembrance of her husband,
the Comte de la Fere, whom she had believed dead, or at least
expatriated, and whom she found again in Athos-the best friend of
dâ€™Artagnan.
But alas, if he was the friend of dâ€™Artagnan, he must have lent him his
assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated
the project of his Eminence; if he was the friend of dâ€™Artagnan, he was
the enemy of the cardinal; and she doubtless would succeed in involving
him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young Musketeer.
All these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for Milady; so, rocked by
them, she soon fell asleep.
She was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed.
She opened her eyes, and saw the abbess, accompanied by a young woman
with light hair and delicate complexion, who fixed upon her a look full
of benevolent curiosity.
The face of the young woman was entirely unknown to her. Each examined
the other with great attention, while exchanging the customary
compliments; both were very handsome, but of quite different styles of
beauty. Milady, however, smiled in observing that she excelled the young
woman by far in her high air and aristocratic bearing. It is true that
the habit of a novice, which the young woman wore, was not very
advantageous in a contest of this kind.
The abbess introduced them to each other. When this formality was ended,
as her duties called her to chapel, she left the two young women alone.
The novice, seeing Milady in bed, was about to follow the example of the
superior; but Milady stopped her.

continued Milady; â€œthat would have been another motive for sympathy

woman whom I thought my friend, and who betrayed me. Are you also the
NA
NA
loved, for whom I would have laid down my life, for whom I would give it
NA
NA
â€œI have been sufficiently unjust to believe so; but during the last two
or three days I have obtained proof to the contrary, for which I thank
God--for it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me.
NA
NA
â€œWhither would you have me go, without friends, without money, in a part
of France with which I am unacquainted, and where I have never been

NA
a moment when the good you have done pleads your cause before God; and
see, perhaps it is a happiness for you, humble and powerless as I am,
that you have met with me, for if I leave this place, well-I have
powerful friends, who, after having exerted themselves on my account,
NA
NA
talk by talking of herself, â€œit is not for want of friends in high
places; but these friends themselves tremble before the cardinal. The
queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible minister. I have
proof that her Majesty, notwithstanding her excellent heart, has more
than once been obliged to abandon to the anger of his Eminence persons
NA
â€œTrust me, madame; the queen may appear to have abandoned those persons,
but we must not put faith in appearances. The more they are persecuted,
the more she thinks of them; and often, when they least expect it, they

NA
â€œOh, you know her, then, that lovely and noble queen, that you speak of

â€œName a few of those whom you know, and you will see if they are my

The novice let her speak, then seeing that she paused, she said, â€œDonâ€™t
NA
Milady became as pale as the sheets in which she was lying, and mistress
as she was of herself, could not help uttering a cry, seizing the hand
of the novice, and devouring her with looks.
NA
NA
â€œNo; but the name struck me, because I also have known that gentleman,
and it appeared strange to me to meet with a person who appears to know
NA
â€œOh, yes, very well; not only him, but some of his friends, Messieurs
NA
NA
to feel a chill penetrate her heart.
â€œWell, if you know them, you know that they are good and free
NA
NA
any of them. I know them from having heard one of their friends,
NA
NA
the hands of Milady and devouring her with her eyes.
Then remarking the strange expression of Miladyâ€™s countenance, she said,

NA
NA

NA
NA
The young woman drew back, filled with surprise and terror.
NA
NA
The countenance of Milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under
any other circumstances Mme. Bonacieux would have fled in terror; but
she was absorbed by jealousy.
NA
might not have been believed capable. â€œHave you been, or are you, his

useless inquiries up to this moment? How could I help being astonished
when, without having the least expectation of such a thing, I meet you
face to face--you, of whom we have so often spoken together, you whom he
loves with all his soul, you whom he had taught me to love before I had
seen you! Ah, dear Constance, I have found you, then; I see you at

And Milady stretched out her arms to Mme. Bonacieux, who, convinced by
what she had just said, saw nothing in this woman whom an instant before
she had believed her rival but a sincere and devoted friend.
NA
NA
These two women held each other for an instant in a close embrace.
Certainly, if Miladyâ€™s strength had been equal to her hatred, Mme.
Bonacieux would never have left that embrace alive. But not being able
to stifle her, she smiled upon her.
NA
NA
she absolutely devoured her by her looks. â€œOh, yes it is you indeed!

The poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty
was behind the rampart of that pure brow, behind those brilliant eyes in
which she read nothing but interest and compassion.

NA
NA
she greedily read the following few lines:
My Dear Child, Hold yourself ready. OUR FRIEND will see you soon, and he
will only see you to release you from that imprisonment in which your
safety required you should be concealed. Prepare, then, for your
departure, and never despair of us.
Our charming Gascon has just proved himself as brave and faithful as
ever. Tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning he has
given.
NA
NA
â€œNo, I only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh

At that moment they heard the gallop of a horse.

Milady remained still in bed, petrified by surprise; so many unexpected
things happened to her all at once that for the first time she was at a
loss.
NA
eyes fixed.
NA

Milady sprang out of bed.

Milady was dressing herself all the time.

Immediately the door opened, and the superior entered.

â€œI will leave you with this stranger; but as soon as he is gone, if you

The superior and Mme. Bonacieux retired.
Milady remained alone, with her eyes fixed upon the door. An instant
later, the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs, steps drew near,
the door opened, and a man appeared.
Milady uttered a cry of joy; this man was the Comte de Rochefort--the
demoniacal tool of his Eminence.

Milady and Rochefort exchanged a smile and separated. An hour afterward
Rochefort set out at a grand gallop; five hours after that he passed
through Arras.
Our readers already know how he was recognized by dâ€™Artagnan, and how
that recognition by inspiring fear in the four Musketeers had given
fresh activity to their journey.
63 THE DROP OF WATER
Rochefort had scarcely departed when Mme. Bonacieux re-entered. She
found Milady with a smiling countenance.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Milady arose, went to the door, opened it, looked in the corridor, and
then returned and seated herself close to Mme. Bonacieux.
NA
NA
â€œHe who just now presented himself to the abbess as a messenger from the
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo one must know this secret, my dear, but yourself. If you reveal it
NA
NA
â€œListen. This is what has happened: My brother, who was coming to my
assistance to take me away by force if it were necessary, met with the
emissary of the cardinal, who was coming in search of me. He followed
him. At a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword, and
required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was
NA
NA
â€œRemember, that was the only means. Then my brother determined to
substitute cunning for force. He took the papers, and presented himself
here as the emissary of the cardinal, and in an hour or two a carriage
NA
NA
â€œExactly; but that is not all. That letter you have received, and which
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, a forgery; it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance
NA
NA
â€œDo not deceive yourself. Dâ€™Artagnan and his friends are detained at the

NA
â€œMy brother met some emissaries of the cardinal in the uniform of
Musketeers. You would have been summoned to the gate; you would have
believed yourself about to meet friends; you would have been abducted,

â€œOh, my God! My senses fail me amid such a chaos of iniquities. I feel,
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI hear a horseâ€™s steps; it is my brother setting off again. I should

Milady opened the window, and made a sign to Mme. Bonacieux to join her.
The young woman complied.
Rochefort passed at a gallop.
NA
The chevalier raised his head, saw the two young women, and without
stopping, waved his hand in a friendly way to Milady.
NA
countenance full of affection and melancholy. And she resumed her seat,
as if plunged in reflections entirely personal.
NA
what do you advise me to do? Good heaven! You have more experience than
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThen you comprehend it would be only a question of time, a sort of
race, which should arrive first. If your friends are the more speedy,
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œTo wait, concealed in the neighborhood, and assure yourself who are the
NA
NA
â€œOh, there is no difficulty in that. I shall stop and conceal myself a
few leagues hence until my brother can rejoin me. Well, I take you with

NA
â€œAs they believe that I go in consequence of an order from the cardinal,
NA
NA
â€œWell! The carriage is at the door; you bid me adieu; you mount the step
to embrace me a last time; my brotherâ€™s servant, who comes to fetch me,
is told how to proceed; he makes a sign to the postillion, and we set
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œNothing easier. We will send my brotherâ€™s servant back to Bethune,
whom, as I told you, we can trust. He shall assume a disguise, and place
himself in front of the convent. If the emissaries of the cardinal
arrive, he will take no notice; if it is Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan and his

NA
NA
â€œOh, yes, yes; you are right. Thus all may go well--all may be for the
NA
â€œSeven or eight leagues at the most. We will keep on the frontiers, for

NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, go down to her, then, to make your request. I feel my head a

NA
NA
NA
â€œHow can I avoid interesting myself for one who is so beautiful and so

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
And the two women parted, exchanging charming smiles.
Milady had told the truth--her head was confused, for her ill-arranged
plans clashed one another like chaos. She required to be alone that she
might put her thoughts a little into order. She saw vaguely the future;
but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her
ideas, as yet confused, a distinct form and a regular plan.
What was most pressing was to get Mme. Bonacieux away, and convey her to
a place of safety, and there, if matters required, make her a hostage.
Milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel, in which
her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did animosity.
Besides, she felt as we feel when a storm is coming on--that this issue
was near, and could not fail to be terrible.
The principal thing for her, then, was, as we have said, to keep Mme.
Bonacieux in her power. Mme. Bonacieux was the very life of dâ€™Artagnan.
This was more than his life, the life of the woman he loved; this was,
in case of ill fortune, a means of temporizing and obtaining good
conditions.
Now, this point was settled; Mme. Bonacieux, without any suspicion,
accompanied her. Once concealed with her at Armentieres, it would be
easy to make her believe that dâ€™Artagnan had not come to Bethune. In
fifteen days at most, Rochefort would be back; besides, during that
fifteen days she would have time to think how she could best avenge
herself on the four friends. She would not be weary, thank God! for she
should enjoy the sweetest pastime such events could accord a woman of
her character--perfecting a beautiful vengeance.
Revolving all this in her mind, she cast her eyes around her, and
arranged the topography of the garden in her head. Milady was like a
good general who contemplates at the same time victory and defeat, and
who is quite prepared, according to the chances of the battle, to march
forward or to beat a retreat.
At the end of an hour she heard a soft voice calling her; it was Mme.
Bonacieuxâ€™s. The good abbess had naturally consented to her request; and
as a commencement, they were to sup together.
On reaching the courtyard, they heard the noise of a carriage which
stopped at the gate.
Milady listened.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The bell of the convent gate was sounded; Milady was not mistaken.
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, go and fetch them, and come to my apartment. We will snatch some
supper; we shall perhaps travel part of the night, and must keep our
NA
NA
NA
â€œCourage, courage! remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be
NA
â€œYes, yes, everything for him. You have restored my courage by a single
NA
Milady ran up to her apartment quickly; she there found Rochefortâ€™s
lackey, and gave him his instructions.
He was to wait at the gate; if by chance the Musketeers should appear,
the carriage was to set off as fast as possible, pass around the
convent, and go and wait for Milady at a little village which was
situated at the other side of the wood. In this case Milady would cross
the garden and gain the village on foot. As we have already said, Milady
was admirably acquainted with this part of France.
If the Musketeers did not appear, things were to go on as had been
agreed; Mme. Bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her
adieu, and she was to take away Mme. Bonacieux.
Mme. Bonacieux came in; and to remove all suspicion, if she had any,
Milady repeated to the lackey, before her, the latter part of her
instructions.
Milady asked some questions about the carriage. It was a chaise drawn by
three horses, driven by a postillion; Rochefortâ€™s lackey would precede
it, as courier.
Milady was wrong in fearing that Mme. Bonacieux would have any
suspicion. The poor young woman was too pure to suppose that any female
could be guilty of such perfidy; besides, the name of the Comtesse de
Winter, which she had heard the abbess pronounce, was wholly unknown to
her, and she was even ignorant that a woman had had so great and so
fatal a share in the misfortune of her life.
NA
The abbess suspects nothing, and believes that I am taken by order of
the cardinal. This man goes to give his last orders; take the least
NA
NA
Milady made her a sign to sit down opposite, poured her a small glass of
Spanish wine, and helped her to the wing of a chicken.
NA
on; by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat, and nobody can guess
NA
Mme. Bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically, and just touched the
glass with her lips.
NA
But at the moment the glass touched her lips, her hand remained
suspended; she heard something on the road which sounded like the
rattling of a distant gallop. Then it grew nearer, and it seemed to her,
almost at the same time, that she heard the neighing of horses.
This noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper
in the midst of a happy dream; she grew pale and ran to the window,
while Mme. Bonacieux, rising all in a tremble, supported herself upon
her chair to avoid falling. Nothing was yet to be seen, only they heard
the galloping draw nearer.
NA
NA
NA
Mme. Bonacieux remained standing, mute, motionless, and pale as a
statue.
The noise became louder; the horses could not be more than a hundred and
fifty paces distant. If they were not yet to be seen, it was because the
road made an elbow. The noise became so distinct that the horses might
be counted by the rattle of their hoofs.
Milady gazed with all the power of her attention; it was just light
enough for her to see who was coming.
All at once, at the turning of the road she saw the glitter of laced
hats and the waving of feathers; she counted two, then five, then eight
horsemen. One of them preceded the rest by double the length of his
horse.
Milady uttered a stifled groan. In the first horseman she recognized
dâ€™Artagnan.
NA
â€œIt is the uniform of the cardinalâ€™s Guards. Not an instant to be lost!
NA
NA
to make a step, glued as she was to the spot by terror.
They heard the horsemen pass under the windows.
NA
along by the arm. â€œThanks to the garden, we yet can flee; I have the
NA
Mme. Bonacieux tried to walk, made two steps, and sank upon her knees.
Milady tried to raise and carry her, but could not do it.
At this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage, which at the
approach of the Musketeers set off at a gallop. Then three or four shots
were fired.
NA
â€œOh, my God, my God! you see my strength fails me; you see plainly I
NA
NA
All at once she paused, a livid flash darted from her eyes; she ran to
the table, emptied into Mme. Bonacieuxâ€™s glass the contents of a ring
which she opened with singular quickness. It was a grain of a reddish
color, which dissolved immediately.
Then, taking the glass with a firm hand, she said, â€œDrink. This wine
NA
young woman, who drank mechanically.
NA
replacing the glass upon the table, with an infernal smile, â€œbut, my
NA
Mme. Bonacieux saw her go without being able to follow her; she was like
people who dream they are pursued, and who in vain try to walk.
A few moments passed; a great noise was heard at the gate. Every instant
Mme. Bonacieux expected to see Milady, but she did not return. Several
times, with terror, no doubt, the cold sweat burst from her burning
brow.
At length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates; the
noise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs. There was a great
murmur of voices which continued to draw near, amid which she seemed to
hear her own name pronounced.
All at once she uttered a loud cry of joy, and darted toward the door;
she had recognized the voice of dâ€™Artagnan.
NA
NA
NA
At the same moment the door of the cell yielded to a shock, rather than
opened; several men rushed into the chamber. Mme. Bonacieux had sunk
into an armchair, without the power of moving.
Dâ€™Artagnan threw down a yet-smoking pistol which he held in his hand,
and fell on his knees before his mistress. Athos replaced his in his
belt; Porthos and Aramis, who held their drawn swords in their hands,
returned them to their scabbards.
â€œOh, dâ€™Artagnan, my beloved dâ€™Artagnan! You have come, then, at last!
NA
NA
â€œOh, it was in vain she told me you would not come! I hoped in silence.
NA
At this word SHE, Athos, who had seated himself quietly, started up.
NA
â€œWhy, my companion. She who out of friendship for me wished to take me
from my persecutors. She who, mistaking you for the cardinalâ€™s Guards,
NA
NA
veil of his mistress. â€œOf what companion are you speaking, dear
NA
â€œOf her whose carriage was at the gate; of a woman who calls herself
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, it was pronounced in my hearing once. Stop--but--it is very
NA
NA
NA
While Porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong
voice, Aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water; but he stopped
at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the
countenance of Athos, who, standing before the table, his hair rising
from his head, his eyes fixed in stupor, was looking at one of the
glasses, and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Mme. Bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of dâ€™Artagnan.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The four friends uttered one and the same cry, but that of Athos
dominated all the rest.
At that moment the countenance of Mme. Bonacieux became livid; a fearful
agony pervaded her frame, and she sank panting into the arms of Porthos
and Aramis.
Dâ€™Artagnan seized the hands of Athos with an anguish difficult to be
described.
â€œAnd what do you believe?â€™ His voice was stifled by sobs.
NA
sprang to avoid sighing.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan released the hands of Athos which he still held clasped in
both his own, and hastened to her. Her beautiful face was distorted with
agony; her glassy eyes had no longer their sight; a convulsive
shuddering shook her whole body; the sweat rolled from her brow.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Then, collecting all her strength, she took the head of the young man
between her hands, looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul
passed into that look, and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to his.
NA
A sigh escaped from the mouth of Mme. Bonacieux, and dwelt for an
instant on the lips of dâ€™Artagnan. That sigh was the soul, so chaste and
so loving, which reascended to heaven.
Dâ€™Artagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms. The young man
uttered a cry, and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy
as herself.
Porthos wept; Aramis pointed toward heaven; Athos made the sign of the
cross.
At that moment a man appeared in the doorway, almost as pale as those in
the chamber. He looked around him and saw Mme. Bonacieux dead, and
dâ€™Artagnan in a swoon. He appeared just at that moment of stupor which
follows great catastrophes.
NA
NA
The persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with
astonishment. It seemed to all three that they knew him.
NA
NA
NA
The three friends remained mute--for although the voice as well as the
countenance reminded them of someone they had seen, they could not
remember under what circumstances.
NA
who probably owes his life to you twice, I must name myself. I am Lord
NA
The three friends uttered a cry of surprise.
NA
NA
NA
â€œI arrived three hours after her at Boulogne. I missed her by twenty
minutes at St. Omer. Finally, at Lilliers I lost all trace of her. I was
going about at random, inquiring of everybody, when I saw you gallop
past. I recognized Monsieur dâ€™Artagnan. I called to you, but you did not
answer me; I wished to follow you, but my horse was too much fatigued to
go at the same pace with yours. And yet it appears, in spite of all your
NA
NA
dâ€™Artagnan, whom Porthos and Aramis were trying to recall to life.
NA
NA
NA
At that moment dâ€™Artagnan opened his eyes. He tore himself from the arms
of Porthos and Aramis, and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of
his mistress.
Athos rose, walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step,
embraced him tenderly, and as he burst into violent sobs, he said to him
with his noble and persuasive voice, â€œFriend, be a man! Women weep for

NA
NA
Athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance
restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to Porthos and Aramis
to go and fetch the superior.
The two friends met her in the corridor, greatly troubled and much upset
by such strange events; she called some of the nuns, who against all
monastic custom found themselves in the presence of five men.
NA

Dâ€™Artagnan concealed his face in the bosom of Athos, and sobbed aloud.
NA
NA
And he drew away his friend, as affectionate as a father, as consoling
as a priest, noble as a man who has suffered much.
All five, followed by their lackeys leading their horses, took their way
to the town of Bethune, whose outskirts they perceived, and stopped
before the first inn they came to.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he
lowered his head, and entered the inn without reply.
Porthos and Aramis regarded each other, not understanding this assurance
of Athos.
Lord de Winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of
dâ€™Artagnan.

Dâ€™Artagnan smiled--for he understood that Athos was sure of his
vengeance when he revealed such a secret. Porthos and Aramis looked at
each other, and grew pale. Lord de Winter thought Athos was mad.

must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns me. Only,
dâ€™Artagnan, if you have not lost it, give me the paper which fell from

NA
NA
64 THE MAN IN THE RED CLOAK
The despair of Athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only
rendered more lucid the brilliant mental faculties of that extraordinary
man.
Possessed by one single thought--that of the promise he had made, and of
the responsibility he had taken--he retired last to his chamber, begged
the host to procure him a map of the province, bent over it, examined
every line traced upon it, perceived that there were four different
roads from Bethune to Armentieres, and summoned the lackeys.
Planchet, Grimaud, Bazin, and Mousqueton presented themselves, and
received clear, positive, and serious orders from Athos.
They must set out the next morning at daybreak, and go to
Armentieres--each by a different route. Planchet, the most intelligent
of the four, was to follow that by which the carriage had gone upon
which the four friends had fired, and which was accompanied, as may be
remembered, by Rochefortâ€™s servant.
Athos set the lackeys to work first because, since these men had been in
the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of them
different and essential qualities. Then, lackeys who ask questions
inspire less mistrust than masters, and meet with more sympathy among
those to whom they address themselves. Besides, Milady knew the masters,
and did not know the lackeys; on the contrary, the lackeys knew Milady
perfectly.
All four were to meet the next day at eleven oâ€™clock. If they had
discovered Miladyâ€™s retreat, three were to remain on guard; the fourth
was to return to Bethune in order to inform Athos and serve as a guide
to the four friends. These arrangements made, the lackeys retired.
Athos then arose from his chair, girded on his sword, enveloped himself
in his cloak, and left the hotel. It was nearly ten oâ€™clock. At ten
oâ€™clock in the evening, it is well known, the streets in provincial
towns are very little frequented. Athos nevertheless was visibly anxious
to find someone of whom he could ask a question. At length he met a
belated passenger, went up to him, and spoke a few words to him. The man
he addressed recoiled with terror, and only answered the few words of
the Musketeer by pointing. Athos offered the man half a pistole to
accompany him, but the man refused.
Athos then plunged into the street the man had indicated with his
finger; but arriving at four crossroads, he stopped again, visibly
embarrassed. Nevertheless, as the crossroads offered him a better chance
than any other place of meeting somebody, he stood still. In a few
minutes a night watch passed. Athos repeated to him the same question he
had asked the first person he met. The night watch evinced the same
terror, refused, in his turn, to accompany Athos, and only pointed with
his hand to the road he was to take.
Athos walked in the direction indicated, and reached the suburb situated
at the opposite extremity of the city from that by which he and his
friends had entered it. There he again appeared uneasy and embarrassed,
and stopped for the third time.
Fortunately, a mendicant passed, who, coming up to Athos to ask charity,
Athos offered him half a crown to accompany him where he was going. The
mendicant hesitated at first, but at the sight of the piece of silver
which shone in the darkness he consented, and walked on before Athos.
Arrived at the angle of a street, he pointed to a small house, isolated,
solitary, and dismal. Athos went toward the house, while the mendicant,
who had received his reward, left as fast as his legs could carry him.
Athos went round the house before he could distinguish the door, amid
the red color in which the house was painted. No light appeared through
the chinks of the shutters; no noise gave reason to believe that it was
inhabited. It was dark and silent as the tomb.
Three times Athos knocked without receiving an answer. At the third
knock, however, steps were heard inside. The door at length was opened,
and a man appeared, of high stature, pale complexion, and black hair and
beard.
Athos and he exchanged some words in a low voice, then the tall man made
a sign to the Musketeer that he might come in. Athos immediately
profited by the permission, and the door was closed behind him.
The man whom Athos had come so far to seek, and whom he had found with
so much trouble, introduced him into his laboratory, where he was
engaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of a
skeleton. All the frame was adjusted except the head, which lay on the
table.
All the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house
occupied himself with the study of natural science. There were large
bottles filled with serpents, ticketed according to their species; dried
lizards shone like emeralds set in great squares of black wood, and
bunches of wild odoriferous herbs, doubtless possessed of virtues
unknown to common men, were fastened to the ceiling and hung down in the
corners of the apartment. There was no family, no servant; the tall man
alone inhabited this house.
Athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have
described, and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down
near him.
Then he explained to him the cause of his visit, and the service he
required of him. But scarcely had he expressed his request when the
unknown, who remained standing before the Musketeer, drew back with
signs of terror, and refused. Then Athos took from his pocket a small
paper, on which two lines were written, accompanied by a signature and a
seal, and presented them to him who had made too prematurely these signs
of repugnance. The tall man had scarcely read these lines, seen the
signature, and recognized the seal, when he bowed to denote that he had
no longer any objection to make, and that he was ready to obey.
Athos required no more. He arose, bowed, went out, returned by the same
way he came, re-entered the hotel, and went to his apartment.
At daybreak dâ€™Artagnan entered the chamber, and demanded what was to be
done.
NA
Some minutes after, the superior of the convent sent to inform the
Musketeers that the burial would take place at midday. As to the
poisoner, they had heard no tidings of her whatever, only that she must
have made her escape through the garden, on the sand of which her
footsteps could be traced, and the door of which had been found shut. As
to the key, it had disappeared.
At the hour appointed, Lord de Winter and the four friends repaired to
the convent; the bells tolled, the chapel was open, the grating of the
choir was closed. In the middle of the choir the body of the victim,
clothed in her novitiate dress, was exposed. On each side of the choir
and behind the gratings opening into the convent was assembled the whole
community of the Carmelites, who listened to the divine service, and
mingled their chant with the chant of the priests, without seeing the
profane, or being seen by them.
At the door of the chapel dâ€™Artagnan felt his courage fall anew, and
returned to look for Athos; but Athos had disappeared.
Faithful to his mission of vengeance, Athos had requested to be
conducted to the garden; and there upon the sand following the light
steps of this woman, who left sharp tracks wherever she went, he
advanced toward the gate which led into the wood, and causing it to be
opened, he went out into the forest.
Then all his suspicions were confirmed; the road by which the carriage
had disappeared encircled the forest. Athos followed the road for some
time, his eyes fixed upon the ground; slight stains of blood, which came
from the wound inflicted upon the man who accompanied the carriage as a
courier, or from one of the horses, dotted the road. At the end of
three-quarters of a league, within fifty paces of Festubert, a larger
bloodstain appeared; the ground was trampled by horses. Between the
forest and this accursed spot, a little behind the trampled ground, was
the same track of small feet as in the garden; the carriage had stopped
here. At this spot Milady had come out of the wood, and entered the
carriage.
Satisfied with this discovery which confirmed all his suspicions, Athos
returned to the hotel, and found Planchet impatiently waiting for him.
Everything was as Athos had foreseen.
Planchet had followed the road; like Athos, he had discovered the stains
of blood; like Athos, he had noted the spot where the horses had halted.
But he had gone farther than Athos--for at the village of Festubert,
while drinking at an inn, he had learned without needing to ask a
question that the evening before, at half-past eight, a wounded man who
accompanied a lady traveling in a post-chaise had been obliged to stop,
unable to go further. The accident was set down to the account of
robbers, who had stopped the chaise in the wood. The man remained in the
village; the woman had had a relay of horses, and continued her journey.
Planchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her, and found
him. He had taken the lady as far as Fromelles; and from Fromelles she
had set out for Armentieres. Planchet took the crossroad, and by seven
oâ€™clock in the morning he was at Armentieres.
There was but one tavern, the Post. Planchet went and presented himself
as a lackey out of a place, who was in search of a situation. He had not
chatted ten minutes with the people of the tavern before he learned that
a woman had come there alone about eleven oâ€™clock the night before, had
engaged a chamber, had sent for the master of the hotel, and told him
she desired to remain some time in the neighborhood.
Planchet had no need to learn more. He hastened to the rendezvous, found
the lackeys at their posts, placed them as sentinels at all the outlets
of the hotel, and came to find Athos, who had just received this
information when his friends returned.
All their countenances were melancholy and gloomy, even the mild
countenance of Aramis.
NA
NA
Each retired to his own apartment.
At eight oâ€™clock in the evening Athos ordered the horses to be saddled,
and Lord de Winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for
the expedition.
In an instant all five were ready. Each examined his arms, and put them
in order. Athos came down last, and found dâ€™Artagnan already on
horseback, and growing impatient.
NA
The four horsemen looked round them with astonishment, for they sought
vainly in their minds to know who this other person could be.
At this moment Planchet brought out Athosâ€™s horse; the Musketeer leaped
lightly into the saddle.
NA
gallop.
In a quarter of an hour he returned, accompanied by a tall man, masked,
and wrapped in a large red cloak.
Lord de Winter and the three Musketeers looked at one another
inquiringly. Neither could give the others any information, for all were
ignorant who this man could be; nevertheless, they felt convinced that
all was as it should be, as it was done by the order of Athos.
At nine oâ€™clock, guided by Planchet, the little cavalcade set out,
taking the route the carriage had taken.
It was a melancholy sight--that of these six men, traveling in silence,
each plunged in his own thoughts, sad as despair, gloomy as
chastisement.
65 TRIAL
It was a stormy and dark night; vast clouds covered the heavens,
concealing the stars; the moon would not rise till midnight.
Occasionally, by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along
the horizon, the road stretched itself before them, white and solitary;
the flash extinct, all remained in darkness.
Every minute Athos was forced to restrain dâ€™Artagnan, constantly in
advance of the little troop, and to beg him to keep in the line, which
in an instant he again departed from. He had but one thought--to go
forward; and he went.
They passed in silence through the little village of Festubert, where
the wounded servant was, and then skirted the wood of Richebourg. At
Herlier, Planchet, who led the column, turned to the left.
Several times Lord de Winter, Porthos, or Aramis tried to talk with the
man in the red cloak; but to every interrogation which they put to him
he bowed, without response. The travelers then comprehended that there
must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence, and ceased
to address themselves to him.
The storm increased, the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly, the
thunder began to growl, and the wind, the precursor of a hurricane,
whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen.
The cavalcade trotted on more sharply.
A little before they came to Fromelles the storm burst. They spread
their cloaks. There remained three leagues to travel, and they did it
amid torrents of rain.
Dâ€™Artagnan took off his hat, and could not be persuaded to make use of
his cloak. He found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his
burning brow and over his body, agitated by feverish shudders.
The moment the little troop passed Goskal and were approaching the Post,
a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk with
which he had been confounded in the darkness, and advanced into the
middle of the road, putting his finger on his lips.
Athos recognized Grimaud.
NA
Grimaud made a sign in the affirmative. Dâ€™Artagnan ground his teeth.
NA
NA
NA
NA
asked Athos.
Grimaud showed his master his forefinger bent.
NA
Grimaud made the sign yes.
NA
NA
NA
Grimaud took his course across the country, and acted as guide to the
cavalcade.
At the end of five hundred paces, more or less, they came to a rivulet,
which they forded.
By the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of Erquinheim.
NA
Grimaud shook his head negatively.
NA
And the troop continued their route.
Another flash illuminated all around them. Grimaud extended his arm, and
by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a little
isolated house on the banks of the river, within a hundred paces of a
ferry.
One window was lighted.
NA
At this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and
came towards them. It was Mousqueton. He pointed his finger to the
lighted window.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Athos sprang from his horse, gave the bridle to Grimaud, and advanced
toward the window, after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to
go toward the door.
The little house was surrounded by a low, quickset hedge, two or three
feet high. Athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window, which
was without shutters, but had the half-curtains closely drawn.
He mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the curtain.
By the light of a lamp he saw a woman, wrapped in a dark mantle, seated
upon a stool near a dying fire. Her elbows were placed upon a mean
table, and she leaned her head upon her two hands, which were white as
ivory.
He could not distinguish her countenance, but a sinister smile passed
over the lips of Athos. He was not deceived; it was she whom he sought.
At this moment a horse neighed. Milady raised her head, saw close to the
panes the pale face of Athos, and screamed.
Athos, perceiving that she knew him, pushed the window with his knee and
hand. The window yielded. The squares were broken to shivers; and Athos,
like the spectre of vengeance, leaped into the room.
Milady rushed to the door and opened it. More pale and menacing than
Athos, dâ€™Artagnan stood on the threshold.
Milady recoiled, uttering a cry. Dâ€™Artagnan, believing she might have
means of flight and fearing she should escape, drew a pistol from his
belt; but Athos raised his hand.
NA

NA
Dâ€™Artagnan obeyed; for Athos had the solemn voice and the powerful
gesture of a judge sent by the Lord himself. Behind dâ€™Artagnan entered
Porthos, Aramis, Lord de Winter, and the man in the red cloak.
The four lackeys guarded the door and the window.
Milady had sunk into a chair, with her hands extended, as if to conjure
this terrible apparition. Perceiving her brother-in-law, she uttered a
terrible cry.

with a forged letter, as if that wine came from my friends. God

countenance as if alive.
All eyes were turned towards this man--for to all except Athos he was
unknown.
Even Athos looked at him with as much stupefaction as the others, for he
knew not how he could in any way find himself mixed up with the horrible
drama then unfolded.
After approaching Milady with a slow and solemn step, so that the table
alone separated them, the unknown took off his mask.
Milady for some time examined with increasing terror that pale face,
framed with black hair and whiskers, the only expression of which was
NA
retreating to the very wall. â€œNo, no! it is an infernal apparition! It

Every one drew back, and the man in the red cloak remained standing
alone in the middle of the room.
NA
The unknown waited for silence, and then resumed, â€œI told you well that
she would know me. Yes, I am the executioner of Lille, and this is my
NA
All eyes were fixed upon this man, whose words were listened to with
anxious attention.
â€œThat woman was once a young girl, as beautiful as she is today. She was
a nun in the convent of the Benedictines of Templemar. A young priest,
with a simple and trustful heart, performed the duties of the church of
that convent. She undertook his seduction, and succeeded; she would have
seduced a saint.
â€œTheir vows were sacred and irrevocable. Their connection could not last
long without ruining both. She prevailed upon him to leave the country;
but to leave the country, to fly together, to reach another part of
France, where they might live at ease because unknown, money was
necessary. Neither had any. The priest stole the sacred vases, and sold
them; but as they were preparing to escape together, they were both
arrested.
â€œEight days later she had seduced the son of the jailer, and escaped.
The young priest was condemned to ten years of imprisonment, and to be
branded. I was executioner of the city of Lille, as this woman has said.
I was obliged to brand the guilty one; and he, gentlemen, was my
brother!
â€œI then swore that this woman who had ruined him, who was more than his
accomplice, since she had urged him to the crime, should at least share
his punishment. I suspected where she was concealed. I followed her, I
caught her, I bound her; and I imprinted the same disgraceful mark upon
her that I had imprinted upon my poor brother.
â€œThe day after my return to Lille, my brother in his turn succeeded in
making his escape; I was accused of complicity, and was condemned to
remain in his place till he should be again a prisoner. My poor brother
was ignorant of this sentence. He rejoined this woman; they fled
together into Berry, and there he obtained a little curacy. This woman
passed for his sister.
â€œThe Lord of the estate on which the chapel of the curacy was situated
saw this pretend sister, and became enamoured of her--amorous to such a
degree that he proposed to marry her. Then she quitted him she had

made a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had
said.

poor brother returned to Lille, and learning the sentence which had
condemned me in his place, surrendered himself, and hanged himself that
same night from the iron bar of the loophole of his prison.

soon as the identity of my brother was proved, I was set at liberty.

At these words, which left no hope, Milady raised herself in all her
pride, and wished to speak; but her strength failed her. She felt that a
powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair, and dragged her
away as irrevocably as fatality drags humanity. She did not, therefore,
even attempt the least resistance, and went out of the cottage.
Lord de Winter, dâ€™Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, went out close
behind her. The lackeys followed their masters, and the chamber was left
solitary, with its broken window, its open door, and its smoky lamp
burning sadly on the table.
66 EXECUTION
It was near midnight; the moon, lessened by its decline, and reddened by
the last traces of the storm, arose behind the little town of
Armentieres, which showed against its pale light the dark outline of its
houses, and the skeleton of its high belfry. In front of them the Lys
rolled its waters like a river of molten tin; while on the other side
was a black mass of trees, profiled on a stormy sky, invaded by large
coppery clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the night. On the
left was an old abandoned mill, with its motionless wings, from the
ruins of which an owl threw out its shrill, periodical, and monotonous
cry. On the right and on the left of the road, which the dismal
procession pursued, appeared a few low, stunted trees, which looked like
deformed dwarfs crouching down to watch men traveling at this sinister
hour.
From time to time a broad sheet of lightning opened the horizon in its
whole width, darted like a serpent over the black mass of trees, and
like a terrible scimitar divided the heavens and the waters into two
parts. Not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere. A
deathlike silence oppressed all nature. The soil was humid and
glittering with the rain which had recently fallen, and the refreshed
herbs sent forth their perfume with additional energy.
Two lackeys dragged Milady, whom each held by one arm. The executioner
walked behind them, and Lord de Winter, dâ€™Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis
walked behind the executioner. Planchet and Bazin came last.
The two lackeys conducted Milady to the bank of the river. Her mouth was
mute; but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence,
supplicating by turns each of those on whom she looked.
Being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys, â€œA thousand
pistoles to each of you, if you will assist my escape; but if you
deliver me up to your masters, I have near at hand avengers who will

Grimaud hesitated. Mousqueton trembled in all his members.
Athos, who heard Miladyâ€™s voice, came sharply up. Lord de Winter did the
same.
NA
NA
Planchet and Bazin were called, and took the places of Grimaud and
Mousqueton.
On the bank of the river the executioner approached Milady, and bound
her hands and feet.
Then she broke the silence to cry out, â€œYou are cowards, miserable
assassins--ten men combined to murder one woman. Beware! If I am not

And as he bound her while saying these words, Milady uttered two or
three savage cries, which produced a strange and melancholy effect in
flying away into the night, and losing themselves in the depths of the
woods.
NA
shrieked Milady, â€œtake me before a tribunal. You are not judges! You

NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThe woman you poisoned at Bethune was still younger than you, madame,

NA
NA
NA
Milady uttered a cry of terror and sank upon her knees. The executioner
took her up in his arms and was carrying her toward the boat.
NA
These cries had something so heartrending in them that M. dâ€™Artagnan,
who had been at first the most eager in pursuit of Milady, sat down on
the stump of a tree and hung his head, covering his ears with the palms
of his hands; and yet, notwithstanding, he could still hear her cry and
threaten.
Dâ€™Artagnan was the youngest of all these men. His heart failed him.
NA
NA
Milady heard these few words and caught at a shadow of hope.
NA
The young man rose and took a step toward her.
But Athos rose likewise, drew his sword, and placed himself in the way.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan sank on his knees and prayed.

NA
Then she arose of herself, and cast around her one of those piercing
looks which seemed to dart from an eye of flame.
She saw nothing; she listened, and she heard nothing.
NA
NA
Then he placed her in the boat, and as he was going to set foot in it
himself, Athos handed him a sum of silver.
NA
NA
NA
NA
And he threw the money into the river.
The boat moved off toward the left-hand shore of the Lys, bearing the
guilty woman and the executioner; all the others remained on the
right-hand bank, where they fell on their knees.
The boat glided along the ferry rope under the shadow of a pale cloud
which hung over the water at that moment.
The troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank; the figures were
defined like black shadows on the red-tinted horizon.
Milady, during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which
fastened her feet. On coming near the bank, she jumped lightly on shore
and took to flight. But the soil was moist; on reaching the top of the
bank, she slipped and fell upon her knees.
She was struck, no doubt, with a superstitious idea; she conceived that
heaven denied its aid, and she remained in the attitude in which she had
fallen, her head drooping and her hands clasped.
Then they saw from the other bank the executioner raise both his arms
slowly; a moonbeam fell upon the blade of the large sword. The two arms
fell with a sudden force; they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the
cry of the victim, then a truncated mass sank beneath the blow.
The executioner then took off his red cloak, spread it upon the ground,
laid the body in it, threw in the head, tied all up by the four corners,
lifted it on his back, and entered the boat again.
In the middle of the stream he stopped the boat, and suspending his
burden over the water cried in a loud voice, â€œLet the justice of God be

closed over it.
Three days afterward the four Musketeers were in Paris; they had not
exceeded their leave of absence, and that same evening they went to pay
their customary visit to M. de Treville.

67 CONCLUSION
On the sixth of the following month the king, in compliance with the
promise he had made the cardinal to return to La Rochelle, left his
capital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of
Buckinghamâ€™s assassination.
Although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger,
the queen, when his death was announced to her, would not believe the
fact, and even imprudently exclaimed, â€œit is false; he has just written
NA
But the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence;
Laporte, detained in England, as everyone else had been, by the orders
of Charles I, arrived, and was the bearer of the dukeâ€™s dying gift to
the queen.
The joy of the king was lively. He did not even give himself the trouble
to dissemble, and displayed it with affectation before the queen. Louis
XIII, like every weak mind, was wanting in generosity.
But the king soon again became dull and indisposed; his brow was not one
of those that long remain clear. He felt that in returning to camp he
should re-enter slavery; nevertheless, he did return.
The cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent, and himself the bird
which flies from branch to branch without power to escape.
The return to La Rochelle, therefore, was profoundly dull. Our four
friends, in particular, astonished their comrades; they traveled
together, side by side, with sad eyes and heads lowered. Athos alone
from time to time raised his expansive brow; a flash kindled in his
eyes, and a bitter smile passed over his lips, then, like his comrades,
he sank again into reverie.
As soon as the escort arrived in a city, when they had conducted the
king to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to
some secluded cabaret, where they neither drank nor played; they only
conversed in a low voice, looking around attentively to see that no one
overheard them.
One day, when the king had halted to fly the magpie, and the four
friends, according to their custom, instead of following the sport had
stopped at a cabaret on the high road, a man coming from la Rochelle on
horseback pulled up at the door to drink a glass of wine, and darted a
searching glance into the room where the four Musketeers were sitting.
NA
NA
Dâ€™Artagnan raised his head and uttered a cry of joy. It was the man he
called his phantom; it was his stranger of Meung, of the Rue des
Fossoyeurs and of Arras.
Dâ€™Artagnan drew his sword, and sprang toward the door.
But this time, instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his
horse, and advanced to meet dâ€™Artagnan.
NA
NA
â€œNeither is it my intention, monsieur, for this time I was seeking you;
NA
NA
â€œI say that you must surrender your sword to me, monsieur, and that
NA
NA
sword, but without yet surrendering it.
NA
Monsieur le Cardinal Richelieu, and I have orders to conduct you to his

The Chevalier de Rochefort cast a glance backward, and saw that Porthos
and Aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate; he understood
that he was completely at the mercy of these four men.

Rochefort remained for a moment in thought; then, as they were only a
dayâ€™s journey from Surgeres, whither the cardinal was to come to meet
the king, he resolved to follow the advice of Athos and go with them.
Besides, this return offered him the advantage of watching his prisoner.
They resumed their route.
On the morrow, at three oâ€™clock in the afternoon, they arrived at
Surgeres. The cardinal there awaited Louis XIII. The minister and the
king exchanged numerous caresses, felicitating each other upon the
fortunate chance which had freed France from the inveterate enemy who
set all Europe against her. After which, the cardinal, who had been
informed that dâ€™Artagnan was arrested and who was anxious to see him,
took leave of the king, inviting him to come the next day to view the
work already done upon the dyke.
On returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of La Pierre,
the cardinal found, standing before the house he occupied, dâ€™Artagnan,
without his sword, and the three Musketeers armed.
This time, as he was well attended, he looked at them sternly, and made
a sign with his eye and hand for dâ€™Artagnan to follow him.
Dâ€™Artagnan obeyed.
NA
cardinal to hear him.
His Eminence bent his brow, stopped for an instant, and then kept on his
way without uttering a single word.
Dâ€™Artagnan entered after the cardinal, and behind dâ€™Artagnan the door
was guarded.
His Eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study, and made a
sign to Rochefort to bring in the young Musketeer.
Rochefort obeyed and retired.
Dâ€™Artagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal; this was his second
interview with Richelieu, and he afterward confessed that he felt well
assured it would be his last.
Richelieu remained standing, leaning against the mantelpiece; a table
was between him and dâ€™Artagnan.
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo, monseigneur, for the only thing for which I could be arrested is
NA
Richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man.
NA
â€œIf Monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me, in the first place,
what crimes are imputed to me, I will then tell him the deeds I have
NA
â€œCrimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads than
NA
NA
the cardinal himself.
â€œYou are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the
kingdom; you are charged with having surprised state secrets; you are

NA
doubt the accusation came from Milady, â€œa woman branded by the justice
of the country; a woman who has espoused one man in France and another
in England; a woman who poisoned her second husband and who attempted

whose crimes your Eminence is doubtless ignorant, since you have honored

â€œThree times she attempted to kill me, and I pardoned her; but she

Dâ€™Artagnan then related the poisoning of Mme. Bonacieux in the convent
of the Carmelites at Bethune, the trial in the isolated house, and the
execution on the banks of the Lys.
A shudder crept through the body of the cardinal, who did not shudder
readily.
But all at once, as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought,
the countenance of the cardinal, till then gloomy, cleared up by
degrees, and recovered perfect serenity.
NA
severity of his words, â€œyou have constituted yourselves judges, without
remembering that they who punish without license to punish are

NA
â€œAnother might reply to your Eminence that he had his pardon in his

NA
NA
NA
words with a singular expression of contempt.
NA
NA
NA
And dâ€™Artagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper
which Athos had forced from Milady, and which he had given to dâ€™Artagnan
to serve him as a safeguard.
His Eminence took the paper, and read in a slow voice, dwelling upon
every syllable:
â€œDec. 3, 1627
â€œIt is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this
has done what he has done.
NA
The cardinal, after having read these two lines, sank into a profound
reverie; but he did not return the paper to dâ€™Artagnan.
NA
said the Gascon to himself. â€œWell, my faith! he shall see how a
NA
The young Musketeer was in excellent disposition to die heroically.
Richelieu still continued thinking, rolling and unrolling the paper in
his hands.
At length he raised his head, fixed his eagle look upon that loyal,
open, and intelligent countenance, read upon that face, furrowed with
tears, all the sufferings its possessor had endured in the course of a
month, and reflected for the third or fourth time how much there was in
that youth of twenty-one years before him, and what resources his
activity, his courage, and his shrewdness might offer to a good master.
On the other side, the crimes, the power, and the infernal genius of
Milady had more than once terrified him. He felt something like a secret
joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice.
Richelieu slowly tore the paper which dâ€™Artagnan had generously
relinquished.
NA
NA
The cardinal approached the table, and without sitting down, wrote a few
lines upon a parchment of which two-thirds were already filled, and
affixed his seal.

Dâ€™Artagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it; it was
a lieutenantâ€™s commission in the Musketeers.

Rochefort and dâ€™Artagnan coolly greeted each other with their lips; but
the cardinal was there, observing them with his vigilant eye.
They left the chamber at the same time.

The two men smiled at each other, shook hands, and saluted his Eminence.

Accordingly, that same evening dâ€™Artagnan repaired to the quarters of
Athos, whom he found in a fair way to empty a bottle of Spanish wine--an
occupation which he religiously accomplished every night.
Dâ€™Artagnan related what had taken place between the cardinal and
himself, and drawing the commission from his pocket, said, â€œHere, my

Dâ€™Artagnan left Athosâ€™s chamber and went to that of Porthos. He found
him clothed in a magnificent dress covered with splendid embroidery,

The young man then entered the apartment of Aramis. He found him
kneeling before a PRIEDIEU with his head leaning on an open prayer book.
He described to him his interview with the cardinal, and said, for the
third time drawing his commission from his pocket, â€œYou, our friend, our

EPILOGUE
La Rochelle, deprived of the assistance of the English fleet and of the
diversion promised by Buckingham, surrendered after a siege of a year.
On the twenty-eighth of October, 1628, the capitulation was signed.
The king made his entrance into Paris on the twenty-third of December of
the same year. He was received in triumph, as if he came from conquering
an enemy and not Frenchmen. He entered by the Faubourg St. Jacques,
under verdant arches.
Dâ€™Artagnan took possession of his command. Porthos left the service, and
in the course of the following year married Mme. Coquenard; the coffer
so much coveted contained eight hundred thousand livres.
Mousqueton had a magnificent livery, and enjoyed the satisfaction of
which he had been ambitious all his life--that of standing behind a
gilded carriage.
Aramis, after a journey into Lorraine, disappeared all at once, and
ceased to write to his friends; they learned at a later period through
Mme. de Chevreuse, who told it to two or three of her intimates, that,
yielding to his vocation, he had retired into a convent--only into
which, nobody knew.
Bazin became a lay brother.
Athos remained a Musketeer under the command of dâ€™Artagnan till the year
1633, at which period, after a journey he made to Touraine, he also quit
the service, under the pretext of having inherited a small property in
Roussillon.
Grimaud followed Athos.
Dâ€™Artagnan fought three times with Rochefort, and wounded him three
times.

They this time embraced heartily, and without retaining any malice.
Planchet obtained from Rochefort the rank of sergeant in the Piedmont
regiment.
M Bonacieux lived on very quietly, wholly ignorant of what had become of
his wife, and caring very little about it. One day he had the imprudence
to recall himself to the memory of the cardinal. The cardinal had him
informed that he would provide for him so that he should never want for
anything in future. In fact, M. Bonacieux, having left his house at
seven oâ€™clock in the evening to go to the Louvre, never appeared again
in the Rue des Fossoyeurs; the opinion of those who seemed to be best
informed was that he was fed and lodged in some royal castle, at the
expense of his generous Eminence.
