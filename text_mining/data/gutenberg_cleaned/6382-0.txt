CHAPTER I
PAUL HARLEY OF CHANCERY LANE
Toward the hour of six on a hot summerâ€™s evening Mr. Paul Harley was
seated in his private office in Chancery Lane reading through a number
of letters which Innes, his secretary, had placed before him for
signature. Only one more remained to be passed, but it was a long,
confidential report upon a certain matter, which Harley had prepared for
His Majestyâ€™s Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department.
He glanced with a sigh of weariness at the little clock upon his table
before commencing to read.
NA
I nodded, smiling. I was quite content to sit and watch my friend at
work.
Paul Harley occupied a unique place in the maelstrom of vice and
ambition which is sometimes called London life. Whilst at present he
held no official post, some of the most momentous problems of British
policy during the past five years, problems imperilling inter-state
relationships and not infrequently threatening a renewal of the world
war, had owed their solution to the peculiar genius of this man.
No clue to his profession appeared upon the plain brass plate attached
to his door, and little did those who regarded Paul Harley merely as a
successful private detective suspect that he was in the confidence
of some who guided the destinies of the Empire. Paul Harleyâ€™s work in
Constantinople during the feverish months preceding hostilities with
Turkey, although unknown to the general public, had been of a
most extraordinary nature. His recommendations were never adopted,
unfortunately. Otherwise, the tragedy of the Dardanelles might have been
averted.
His surroundings as he sat there, gaze bent upon the typewritten pages,
were those of any other professional man. So it would have seemed to the
casual observer. But perhaps there was a quality in the atmosphere of
the office which would have told a more sensitive visitor that it was
the apartment of no ordinary man of business. Whilst there were filing
cabinets and bookshelves laden with works of reference, many of them
legal, a large and handsome Burmese cabinet struck an unexpected note.
On closer inspection, other splashes of significant colour must have
been detected in the scheme, notably a very fine engraving of Edgar
Allan Poe, from the daguerreotype of 1848; and upon the man himself lay
the indelible mark of the tropics. His clean-cut features had that hint
of underlying bronze which tells of years spent beneath a merciless sun,
and the touch of gray at his temples only added to the eager, almost
fierce vitality of the dark face. Paul Harley was notable because of
that intellectual strength which does not strike one immediately,
since it is purely temperamental, but which, nevertheless, invests its
possessor with an aura of distinction.
Writing his name at the bottom of the report, Paul Harley enclosed the
pages in a long envelope and dropped the envelope into a basket which
contained a number of other letters. His work for the day was ended, and
glancing at me with a triumphant smile, he stood up. His office was a
part of a residential suite, but although, like some old-time burgher of
the city, he lived on the premises, the shutting of a door which led to
his private rooms marked the close of the business day. Pressing a bell
which connected with the public office occupied by his secretary, Paul
Harley stood up as Innes entered.
NA
NA
Paul Harley laughed shortly.
NA
thankless job, Innes. It is the fifth draft you have prepared and it

He took up a letter which lay unsealed upon the table. â€œThis is the
NA
NA
NA
the basket. â€œI see you have turned down the little job offered by the
NA

guineas with it. I have also intimated to that distressed nobleman that
this is a business office and that a laundry is the proper place to take
his dirty linen. No, thereâ€™s nothing further to-night, Innes. You can

But as if in answer to his enquiry the typist, who with Innes made up
the entire staff of the office, came in at that moment, a card in her
hand. Harley glanced across in my direction and then at the card, with a
wry expression.

something really interesting, or does he want a woman watched? However,
his name sounds piquant, so perhaps I had better see him. Ask him to

Innes and Miss Smith retiring, there presently entered a man of most
striking and unusual presence. In the first place, Colonel Menendez must
have stood fully six feet in his boots, and he carried himself like a
grandee of the golden days of Spain. His complexion was extraordinarily
dusky, whilst his hair, which was close cropped, was iron gray. His
heavy eyebrows and curling moustache with its little points were equally
black, so that his large teeth gleamed very fiercely when he smiled. His
eyes were large, dark, and brilliant, and although he wore an admirably
cut tweed suit, for some reason I pictured him as habitually wearing
riding kit. Indeed I almost seemed to hear the jingle of his spurs.
He carried an ebony cane for which I mentally substituted a crop, and
his black derby hat I thought hardly as suitable as a sombrero. His age
might have been anything between fifty and fifty-five.
Standing in the doorway he bowed, and if his smile was Mephistophelean,
there was much about Colonel Juan Menendez which commanded respect.
NA
another surprise, â€œI feel somewhat ill at ease to--how do you say
it?--appropriate your time, as I am by no means sure that what I have to

He spoke most fluent, indeed florid, English. But his sentences at times
were oddly constructed; yet, save for a faint accent, and his frequent
NA
nervous mannerism--one might have supposed him to be a Britisher who had
lived much abroad. I formed the opinion that he had read extensively,
and this, as I learned later, was indeed the case.
NA
â€œOfficially, my working day is ended, I admit, but if you have no
objection to the presence of my friend, Mr. Knox, I shall be most happy
NA
He smiled in a way all his own.
NA
â€œI must beg you to excuse me for fourteen days, as I am taking a badly
NA
NA
table, and sitting down rather wearily in a big leathern armchair which
Harley had pushed forward. â€œIf I intrude I am sorry, but indeed my
business is urgent, and I come to you on the recommendation of my

He raised his eyes to Harleyâ€™s face with an expression of peculiar
appeal. I rose to depart, but:

NA
NA
Colonel Menendez extracted a slip of rice paper from a little packet
which he carried, next, dipping two long, yellow fingers into his coat
pocket, he brought out a portion of tobacco, laid it in the paper, and
almost in the twinkling of an eye had made, rolled, and lighted a very
creditable cigarette. His dexterity was astonishing, and seeing my
surprise he raised his heavy eyebrows, and:
NA
He shrugged his shoulders and dropped the extinguished match in an ash
tray, whilst I studied him with increasing interest. Some dread, real or
imaginary, was oppressing the manâ€™s mind, I mused. I felt my presence to
be unwelcome, but:
NA
disposed to regard what I have to tell you rather as a symptom of what

Colonel Menendez slowly nodded his head.

â€œIf I had not good reasons, Mr. Harley, nothing could have induced me to
trouble you. Yet, even now that I have compelled myself to come here, I

An expression of embarrassment appeared upon the brown face, and now
Colonel Menendez paused and was plainly at a loss for words with which
to continue.
Harley replaced the tin in the cupboard and struck a match. Lighting his
NA
matter of fact, he probably thought, as I did, that this was a familiar
case of a man of possibly blameless life who had become subject to
that delusion which leads people to believe themselves threatened by
mysterious and unnameable danger.
Our visitor inhaled deeply.
NA
speaking with a slowness which told of a mind labouring for the right
mode of expression. â€œThese are so scanty, I fear, of so, shall I say,
phantom a kind, that even when they are in your possession you will
consider me to be merely the victim of a delusion. In the first place,
then, I have reason to believe that someone followed me from my home to

accent, â€œif I had seen him, so much would have been made clear, so
much! I have never seen him, but I have heard him and felt him--felt his

â€œOn several occasions on turning out the light in my bedroom and
looking across the lawn from my window I have observed the shadow of

Paul Harley exhibited evidence of a quickening curiosity. He had
perceived, as I had perceived, that the manner of the speaker differed
from that of the ordinary victim of delusion, with whom he had become
professionally familiar.

â€œIt was due to insomnia, sleeplessness, brought about, yes, I will admit

NA
NA
NA
â€œYou can obtain the evidence of all my household that someone had

access through a kitchen window, had forced two locks, and was coming
stealthily along the hallway when the sound of his footsteps attracted

NA
â€œI came out on to the landing and looked down the stairs. But even the
slight sound which I made had been sufficient to alarm the midnight
visitor, for I had never a glimpse of him. Only, as he went swiftly
back in the direction from which he had come, the moonlight shining in

NA
NA

Colonel Menendez hesitated momentarily, and glanced swiftly across at
Harley.
NA
NA
NA
NA
He inhaled again deeply and was silent for a while.
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo clue except the filed fastening of a window and two open doors which
NA
NA
isolated one and in no way connected with the surveillance of which you
complain. I mean that this person who undoubtedly entered your house

impressively--â€œso my house is named--stands a case containing

shining fully upon this case, and does the burglar live who will pass

He gazed keenly at his visitor, and the latter, whilst meeting the look
unflinchingly with his large dark eyes, was unable to conceal the fact
that he had received a home thrust.

point which I have concerns a man, a neighbour of mine in Surrey. Before

of pure Spanish blood, I was born in Cuba. The greater part of my
life has been spent in the West Indies, where prior to â€˜98 I held an
appointment under the Spanish Government. I have property, not only in
Cuba, but in some of the smaller islands which formerly were Spanish,
and I shall not conceal from you that during the latter years of my
administration I incurred the enmity of a section of the population. Do

Paul Harley nodded and exchanged a swift glance with me. I formed a
rapid mental picture of native life under the governorship of Colonel
Juan Menendez and I began to consider his story from a new viewpoint.
Seemingly rendered restless by his reflections, he stood up and began
to pace the floor, a tall but curiously graceful figure. I noticed the
bulldog tenacity of his chin, the intense pride in his bearing, and I
wondered what kind of menace had induced him to seek the aid of Paul
Harley; for whatever his failings might be, and I could guess at the
nature of several of them, that this thin-lipped Spanish soldier knew
the meaning of fear I was not prepared to believe.

Colonel Menendez turned in a flash, glaring down at the speaker.
NA
NA
The Colonel placed the stump of his first cigarette in an ash tray and
lighted that which he had newly made.
NA
NA
He stood squarely in front of the Burmese cabinet, resting one hand upon
his hip. Then he added a remark which surprised me.

Paul Harley took his pipe from between his teeth and stared at the

much in the East, I am prepared to learn that Voodoo may not be a

Colonel Menendez glared almost fiercely across the room at Paul Harley.

â€œThat, Mr. Harley, is for you to decide when all the facts shall be in

NA

From an inside breast pocket Colonel Menendez drew out a gold-mounted
case, and from the case took some flat, irregularly shaped object
wrapped in a piece of tissue paper. Unfolding the paper, he strode
across and laid the object which it had contained upon the blotting pad
in front of my friend.
Impelled by curiosity I stood up and advanced to inspect it. It was of
a dirty brown colour, some five or six inches long, and appeared to
consist of a kind of membrane. Harley, his elbow on the table, was
staring down at it questioningly.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Paul Harleyâ€™s expression was compounded of incredulity, wonder, and
something else, as, continuing to stare at the speaker, he replied:
NA
CHAPTER II
THE VOODOO SWAMP
Often enough my memory has recaptured that moment in Paul Harleyâ€™s
office, when Harley, myself, and the tall Spaniard stood looking down at
the bat wing lying upon the blotting pad.
My brilliant friend at times displayed a sort of prescience, of which
I may have occasion to speak later, but I, together with the rest of
pur-blind humanity, am commonly immune from the prophetic instinct.
Therefore I chronicle the fact for what it may be worth, that as I gazed
with a sort of disgust at the exhibit lying upon the table I became
possessed of a conviction, which had no logical basis, that a door had
been opened through which I should step into a new avenue of being; I
felt myself to stand upon the threshold of things strange and terrible,
but withal alluring. Perhaps it is true that in the great crises of life
the inner eye becomes momentarily opened.
With intense curiosity I awaited the Colonelâ€™s next words, but, a
cigarette held nervously between his fingers, he stood staring at
Harley, and it was the latter who broke that peculiar silence which had
fallen upon us.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI am all anxiety to learn the remainder of your story, Colonel
NA
â€œGood. Your interest comforts me very greatly, Mr. Harley. But when
first I came, you led me to suppose that you were departing from

â€œAccompanied by my friend, Mr. Knox, I had proposed to indulge in a

Menendez, dexterously rolling his cigarette around between his fingers.
â€œYet because of my urgent need I dare to do so. Would yourself and your
friend honour me with your company at Crayâ€™s Folly for a few days? I
can promise you good entertainment, although I regret that there is no
fishing; but it may chance that there will be other and more exciting

Harley glanced at me significantly.

Colonel Menendez nodded, at the same time bringing his hand down sharply
upon the table.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Paul Harley stood up, and watched by the Spanish colonel paced slowly
across the office. At the outer door he paused and turned.
NA
a busy man I do not for a moment believe, therefore I shall ask you as
briefly as possible to state your case in detail. When I have heard it,
if it appears to me that any good purpose can be served by my friend
and myself coming to Crayâ€™s Folly I feel sure that he will be happy to

NA
I, which indeed was perfectly true.
Whilst I had willingly agreed to accompany Harley to Norfolk I had
none of his passion for the piscatorial art, and the promise of novel
excitement held out by Colonel Menendez appealed to me more keenly than
the lazy days upon the roads which Harley loved.

NA
He resumed his seat, and began, it seemed almost automatically, to roll
a fresh cigarette.
NA
wondering fashion to the bat wing lying on his table.
NA
may seem to you to be important can be discussed later when you are
my guests. You must know then that I first became acquainted with the
significance belonging to the term â€˜Bat Wingâ€™ and to the object itself
NA
NA
to tell me that the menace of which you complain is of twenty yearsâ€™
NA
NA
brusquely, â€œI am dealing with possibilities which are remote, because
in your own words it is sometimes the remote which proves to be the
intimate. It was then rather more than twenty years ago, at a time when
great political changes were taking place in the West Indies, that my
business interests, which are mainly concerned with sugar, carried me
to one of the smaller islands which had formerly been under--my
jurisdiction, do you say? Here I had a house and estate, and here in the
past I had experienced much trouble with the natives.
â€œI do not disguise from you that I was unpopular, and on my return I
met with unmistakable signs of hostility. My native workmen were
insubordinate. In fact, it was the reports from my overseers which had
led me to visit the island. I made a tour of the place, believing it to
be necessary to my interests that I should get once more in touch
with negro feeling, since I had returned to my home in Cuba after the
upheavals in â€˜98. Very well.
â€œThe manager of my estate, a capable man, was of opinion that
there existed a secret organization amongst the native labourers
operating--you understand?--against my interests. He produced certain
evidences of this. They were not convincing; and all my enquiries and
examinations of certain inhabitants led to no definite results. Yet I
NA
He paused to light his third cigarette, and whilst he did so I conjured
NA
recalled hazily those stories of Spanish mismanagement and cruelty which
had directly led to United States interferences in the islands. But
whilst I could well believe that this manâ€™s life had not been safe in
those bad old days in the West Indies, I found it difficult to suppose
that a native plot against his safety could have survived for more than
twenty years and have come to a climax in England. However, I realized
that there was more to follow, and presently, having lighted his
cigarette, the Colonel resumed:
â€œIn the neighbourhood of the hacienda which had once been my official
residence there was a belt of low-lying pest country--you understand
pest country?--which was a hot-bed of poisonous diseases. It followed
the winding course of a nearly stagnant creek. From the earliest
times the Black Belt--it was so called--had been avoided by European
inhabitants, and indeed by the coloured population as well. Apart from
the malaria of the swampy ground it was infested with reptiles and with
poisonous insects of a greater variety and of a more venomous character
than I have ever known in any part of the world.
â€œI must explain that what I regarded as a weak point in my managerâ€™s
theory was this: Whilst he held that the native labourers to a man were
linked together under some head, or guiding influence, he had never
succeeded in surprising anything in the nature of a negro meeting.
Indeed, he had prohibited all gatherings of this kind. His answer to
my criticism was a curious one. He declared that the members of this
mysterious society met and received their instructions at some place
within the poison area to which I have referred, believing themselves
there to be safe from European interference.
â€œFor a long time I disputed this with poor Valera--for such was my
managerâ€™s name; when one night as I was dismounting from my horse before
the veranda, having returned from a long ride around the estate, a shot
was fired from the border of the Black Belt which at one point crept up
dangerously close to the hacienda.
â€œThe shot was a good one. I had caught my spur in the stirrup in
dismounting, and stumbled. Otherwise I must have been a dead man. The
bullet pierced the crown of my hat, only missing my skull by an inch or
less. The alarm was given. But no search-party could be mustered, do you
say?--which was prepared to explore the poison swamp--or so declared
my native servants. Valera, however, seized upon this incident to
illustrate his theory that there were those in the island who did not
hesitate to enter the Black Belt popularly supposed to cast up noxious
vapours at dusk of a sort fatal to any traveller.
â€œThat night over our wine we discussed the situation, and he pointed
out to me that now was the hour to test his theory. Orders had evidently
been given for my assassination and the attempt had failed.
â€œâ€˜There will be a meeting,â€™ said Valera, â€˜to discuss the next move. And
it will take place to-morrow night!â€™
â€œI challenged him with a glance and I replied:
â€œâ€˜To-morrow night is a full moon, and if you are agreeable we will make
a secret expedition into the swamp, and endeavour to find the clearing
which you say is there, and which you believe to be the rendezvous of
the conspirators.â€™
â€œEven in the light of the lamp I saw Valera turn pale, but he was a
Spaniard and a man of courage.
â€œâ€˜I agree, seÃ±or,â€™ he replied. â€˜If my information is correct we shall
find the way.â€™
â€œI must explain that the information to which he referred had been
supplied by a native girl who loved him. That this clearing was a
meeting-place she had denied. But she had admitted that it was possible
NA
NA
Colonel Menendez spoke these last words with great deliberation and
treated each of us to a long and significant stare.
NA
her hut on the night that she fell ill. But to continue my narrative.
On the following evening, suitably equipped, Valera and myself set out,
leaving by a side door and striking into the woods at a point east of
the hacienda, where, according to his information, a footpath existed,
which would lead us to the clearing we desired to visit. Of that
journey, gentlemen, I have most terrible memories.
â€œImagine a dense and poisonous jungle, carpeted by rotten vegetation
in which oneâ€™s feet sank deeply and from which arose a visible and
stenching vapour. Imagine living things, slimy things, moving beneath
the tread, sometimes coiling about our riding boots, sometimes making
hissing sounds. Imagine places where the path was overgrown, and we must
thrust our way through bushes where great bloated spiders weaved
their webs, where clammy night things touched us as we passed, where
unfamiliar and venomous insects clung to our garments.
â€œWe proceeded onward for more than half an hour guided by the moonlight,
but this, although tropically brilliant, at some places scarcely
penetrated the thick vapour which arose from the jungle. In those days I
was a young and vigorous man; my companion was several years my senior;
and his sufferings were far greater than my own. But if the jungle was
horrible, worse was yet to come.
â€œPresently we stumbled upon an open space almost quite bare of
vegetation, a poisonous green carpet spread in the heart of the woods.
Here the vapour was more dense than ever, but I welcomed the sight of
open ground after the reptile-infested thicket. Alas! it was a snare, a
death-trap, a sort of morass, in which we sank up to our knees. Pah!
it was filthy--vile! And I became aware of great--lassitude, do you
say?--whilst Valeraâ€™s panting breath told that he had almost reached the
end of his resources.
â€œA faint breeze moved through the clearing and for a few moments we
were enabled to perceive one another more distinctly. I uttered an
exclamation of horror.
â€œMy companionâ€™s garments were a mass of strange-looking patches.
â€œEven as I noticed them I glanced rapidly down--and found myself in
similar condition. As I did so one of these patches upon the sleeve of
my tunic intruded coldly upon my bare wrist. At that I cried out aloud
in fear. Valera and I commenced what was literally a fight for life.
â€œGentlemen, we were attacked by some kind of blood-red leeches, which
came out of the slime! In detaching them one detached patches of skin,
and they swarmed over our bodies like ants upon carrion.
â€œThey penetrated beneath our garments, these swollen, lustful, unclean
things; and it was whilst we staggered on through the swamp in agony of
mind and body that we saw the light of many torches amid the trees ahead
of us, and in their smoky glare witnessed the flight of hundreds
of bats. The moonlight creeping dimly through the mist, and the
torchlight--how do you say?--enflaming the vegetation, created a scene
like that of Inferno, in which naked figures danced wildly, uttering
animal cries.
â€œAbove the shrieking and howling, which rose and fell in a sort of
unholy chorus, I heard one long, wailing sound, repeated and repeated.
It was an African word. But I knew its meaning.
â€œIt was â€˜_Bat Wing_!â€™
â€œMy doubts were dispersed. This was a meeting-place of
Devil-worshippers, or devotees of the cult of Voodoo! One man only could
I see clearly so as to remember him, a big negro employed upon one of
my estates. He seemed to be a sort of high priest or president of the
orgies. Attached to his arms were giant imitations of bat wings which he
moved grotesquely as if in flight. There were many women in the throng,
which numbered fully I should think a hundred people. But the final
collapse of my brave, unhappy Valera at this point brought home to me
the nature of the peril in which I stood.
â€œHe lay at my feet, moving convulsively, and sinking ever deeper in
the swamp, red leeches moving slowly, slowly over his fast-disappearing
NA
Colonel Menendez paused in his appalling narrative and wiped his moist
forehead with a silk handkerchief. Neither Harley nor I spoke. I knew
not if my friend believed the Spaniardâ€™s story. For my own part I found
it difficult to do so. But that the narrator was deeply moved was a fact
beyond dispute.
He suddenly commenced again:
â€œMy next recollection is of awakening in my own bed at the hacienda. I
had staggered back as far as the veranda, in raving delirium, and in the
grip of a strange fever which prostrated me for many months, and which
defied the knowledge of all the specialists who could be procured from
Cuba and the United States. My survival was due to an iron constitution;
but I have never been the same man. I was ordered to leave the West
Indies directly it became possible for me to be moved. I arranged my
affairs accordingly, and did not return for many years.
â€œFinally, however, I again took up my residence in Cuba, and for a time
all went well, and might have continued to do so, but for the following
incident. One night, being troubled by insomnia--sleeplessness--and the
heat, I walked out on to the balcony in front of my bedroom window. As
I did so, a figure which had been--you say lurking?--somewhere under the
veranda ran swiftly off; but not so swiftly that I failed to obtain a
glimpse of the uplifted face.
â€œIt was the big negro! Although many years had elapsed since I had seen
him wearing the bat wings at those unholy rites, I knew him instantly.
â€œOn a little table close behind me where I stood lay a loaded revolver.
I snatched it in a flash and fired shot after shot at the retreating

Colonel Menendez shrugged his shoulders and selected a fresh cigarette

in hourly peril of my life. Whether I hit my man or missed him, I have
NA
paused impressively--â€œI have told you of something that was nailed to
the hut of a certain native girl? Before she died I knew that it was a
death-token.
â€œOn the morning after the episode which I have just related attached to
NA
NA
â€œIt was the wing of a bat!
â€œI am perhaps a hasty man. It is in my blood. I tore the unclean thing
from the panel and stamped it under my feet. No one of the servants
who had drawn my attention to its presence would consent to touch
it. Indeed, they all shrank from me as though I, too, were unclean. I
endeavoured to forget it. Who was I to be influenced by the threats of
natives?
â€œThat night, just at the hour of sunset, a shot was fired at me from a
neighbouring clump of trees, only missing me I think by the fraction of
an inch. I realized that the peril was real, and was one against which I
could not fight.
â€œPermit me to be brief, gentlemen. Six attempts of various kinds
were made upon my life in Cuba. I crossed to the United States. In

access to my hotel apartment and but for the fact that a friend chanced
to call me up on the telephone at that late hour of the night, thereby

knife in the dim light; I saw the shadowy figure. I leapt out on the
opposite side of the bed, seized a table-lamp which stood there, and
hurled it at my assailant.

CHAPTER III
THE VAMPIRE BAT
An hour had elapsed since the departure of our visitor, and Paul Harley
and I sat in the cosy, book-lined study discussing the strange story
which had been related to us. Harley, who had a friend attached to
the Spanish Embassy, had succeeded in getting in touch with him at his
chambers, and had obtained some few particulars of interest concerning
Colonel Don Juan Sarmiento Menendez, for such were the full names and
titles of our late caller.
He was apparently the last representative of a once great Spanish
family, established for many generations in Cuba. His wealth was
incalculable, although the value of his numerous estates had depreciated
in recent years. His family had produced many men of subtle intellect
and powerful administrative qualities; but allied to this they had all
possessed traits of cruelty and debauchery which at one time had made
the name of Menendez a by-word in the West Indies. That there were many
people in that part of the world who would gladly have assassinated
the Colonel, Paul Harleyâ€™s informant did not deny. But although this
information somewhat enlarged our knowledge of my friendâ€™s newest
client, it threw no fresh light upon that side of his story which
related to Voodoo and the extraordinary bat wing episodes.
NA
NA
NA
â€œThat Menendez may be mad. Remorse for crimes of cruelty committed in
his youth, and beyond doubt he has been guilty of many, may have led to

NA
the Colonelâ€™s story proceeded. I donâ€™t think any such explanation would

NA
such an obsession exists, and that someone is deliberately playing upon

â€œYou mean that someone who knows of these episodes in the earlier life

NA
NA
â€œI quite agree, Knox. With you, I believe, that even if the Colonel is

He gingerly took up the bat wing from the arm of his chair where he had
placed it after a detailed examination.
NA
NA
touched a work which lay open on the other arm of his chair--â€œthese are
natives of tropical America, therefore the presence of a living vampire
bat in Surrey is not to be anticipated. I am personally satisfied,
NA
NA
â€œQuite possibly. But even a collection of such bats would be quite a
novelty. I donâ€™t know that I can recollect one outside the Museums. To
follow this bat wing business further: there was one very curious point
in the Colonelâ€™s narrative. You recollect his reference to a native girl
NA
I nodded rapidly.
â€œA bat wing was affixed to the wall of her hut and she died, according
to our informant, of a lingering sickness. Now this lingering sickness
might have been anÃ¦mia, and anÃ¦mia may be induced, either in man or
NA
NA
â€œIt _is_ a horrible idea, but in countries infested by these creatures
such things happen occasionally. I distinctly recollect a story which
I once heard, of a little girl in some district of tropical America
falling into such a decline, from which she was only rescued in the nick
of time by the discovery that one of these Vampire Bats, a particularly
large one, had formed the habit of flying into her room at night and
NA
NA
â€œThe very point, Knox, which led to the discovery of the truth. The
thing, exhibiting a sort of uncanny intelligence, used to work its way
up under the edge of the netting. This disturbance of the curtains was
noticed on several occasions by the nurse who occupied an adjoining
NA
NA
â€œOn the contrary, it induces deeper sleep. But I have not yet come to my
point, Knox. The vengeance of the High Priest of Voodoo, who figured in
the Colonelâ€™s narrative, was characteristic in the case of the native
woman, since her symptoms at least simulated those which would result
from the visits of a Vampire Bat, although of course they may have been
due to a slow poison. But you will not have failed to note that the
several attacks upon the Colonel personally were made with more ordinary
NA
NA
NA
â€œI am, Knox. I can only suppose that he proved to be immune. You recall
his statement that he made an almost miraculous recovery from the fever
which attacked him after his visit to the Black Belt? This would seem to
point to the fact that he possesses that rare type of constitution which

â€œQuite so. Nor must we forget the Spanish butler, and the Colonel

bizarre. But those of us who overstep the border become preposterous
in the eyes of those who have never done so. This is not because the
unusual is necessarily the untrue, but because writers of fiction have
claimed the unusual as their particular province, and in doing so have
divorced it from fact in the public eye. Thus I, myself, am a myth, and
NA
He raised his hand and pointed to the doorway communicating with the
office.
â€œWe owe our mythological existence to that American genius whose
portrait hangs beside the Burmese cabinet and who indiscreetly
created the character of C. Auguste Dupin. The doings of this amateur
investigator were chronicled by an admirer, you may remember, since
when no private detective has been allowed to exist outside the pages of
fiction. My most trivial habits confirm my unreality.
â€œFor instance, I have a friend who is good enough sometimes to record
my movements. So had Dupin. I smoke a pipe. So did Dupin. I investigate
crime, and I am sometimes successful. Here I differ from Dupin. Dupin
was always successful. But my argument is this--you complain that the
life of Colonel Don Juan Sarmiento Menendez, on his own showing,
has been at least as romantic as his name. It would not be accounted
romantic by the adventurous, Knox; it is only romantic to the prosaic
mind. In the same way his name is only unusual to our English ears. In
NA
NA
NA
â€œI am thinking of it, Knox, and it affords me much delight to think of
it. You have placed your finger I upon the very point I was endeavouring
to make. Voodoo in the Surrey Hills! Quite so. Voodoo in some island
of the Caribbean Seas, yes, but Voodoo in the Surrey Hills, no. Yet, my
dear fellow, there is a regular steamer service between South America
and England. Or one may embark at Liverpool and disembark in the Spanish
Main. Why, then, may not one embark in the West Indies and disembark
at Liverpool? This granted, you will also grant that from Liverpool to
Surrey is a feasible journey. Why, then, should you exclaim, â€˜but Voodoo
in the Surrey Hills!â€™ You would be surprised to meet an Esquimaux in
the Strand, but there is no reason why an Esquimaux should not visit the
Strand. In short, the most annoying thing about fact is its resemblance
to fiction. I am looking forward to the day, Knox, when I can retire
from my present fictitious profession and become a recognized member
of the community; such as a press agent, a theatrical manager, or some

glass and his own.

CHAPTER IV
CRAYâ€™S FOLLY
Paul Harley lay back upon the cushions and glanced at me with a
quizzical smile. The big, up-to-date car which Colonel Menendez had
placed at our disposal was surmounting a steep Surrey lane as though no
gradient had existed.
NA
I nodded in agreement, but felt disinclined for conversation, being
absorbed in watching the characteristically English scenery. This,
indeed, was very beautiful. The lane along which we were speeding was
narrow, winding, and over-arched by trees. Here and there sunlight
penetrated to spread a golden carpet before us, but for the most part
the way lay in cool and grateful shadow.
On one side a wooded slope hemmed us in blackly, on the other lay dell
after dell down into the cradle of the valley. It was a poetic corner of
England, and I thought it almost unbelievable that London was only some
twenty miles behind. A fit place this for elves and fairies to
survive, a spot in which the presence of a modern automobile seemed a
desecration. Higher we mounted and higher, the engine running strongly
and smoothly; then, presently, we were out upon a narrow open road with
the crescent of the hills sweeping away on the right and dense woods
dipping valleyward to the left and behind us.
The chauffeur turned, and, meeting my glance:
NA
He jerked his hand in the direction of a square, gray-stone tower
somewhat resembling a campanile, which uprose from a distant clump of
woods cresting a greater eminence.
NA
Following the departure of the Colonel on the previous evening, he had
looked up Crayâ€™s Folly and had found it to be one of a series of houses
erected by the eccentric and wealthy man whose name it bore. He had
had a mania for building houses with towers, in which his rival--and
NA
which for some obscure reason has survived as well as two of the three
towers erected by its writer.
I became conscious of a keen sense of anticipation. In this, I think,
the figure of Miss Val Beverley played a leading part. There was
something pathetic in the presence of this lonely English girl in so
singular a household; for if the menage at Crayâ€™s Folly should prove
half so strange as Colonel Menendez had led us to believe, then truly we
were about to find ourselves amid unusual people.
Presently the road inclined southward somewhat and we entered the fringe
of the trees. I noticed one or two very ancient cottages, but no trace
of the modern builder. This was a fragment of real Old England, and
I was not sorry when presently we lost sight of the square tower; for
amidst such scenery it was an anomaly and a rebuke.
What Paul Harleyâ€™s thoughts may have been I cannot say, but he preserved
an unbroken silence up to the very moment that we came to the gate
lodge.
The gates were monstrosities of elaborate iron scrollwork, craftsmanship
clever enough in its way, but of an ornate kind more in keeping with the
orange trees of the South than with this wooded Surrey countryside.
A very surly-looking girl, quite obviously un-English (a daughter of
Pedro, the butler, I learned later), opened the gates, and we entered
upon a winding drive literally tunnelled through the trees. Of the house
we had never a glimpse until we were right under its walls, nor should
I have known that we were come to the main entrance if the car had not
stopped.
NA
Indeed that part of the building--the north front--which was visible
from this point had a strangely monastic appearance, being built of
solid gray blocks and boasting only a few small, heavily barred windows.
The eccentricity of the Victorian gentleman who had expended thousands
of pounds upon erecting this house was only equalled, I thought, by that
of Colonel Menendez, who had chosen it for a home. An out-jutting wing
shut us in on the west, and to the east the prospect was closed by the
tallest and most densely grown box hedge I had ever seen, trimmed most
perfectly and having an arched opening in the centre. Thus, the entrance
to Crayâ€™s Folly lay in a sort of bay.
But even as we stepped from the car, the great church-like oaken doors
were thrown open, and there, framed in the monkish porch, stood the
tall, elegant figure of the Colonel.
NA
He advanced smiling, and in the bright sunlight seemed even more
Mephistophelean than he had seemed in Harleyâ€™s office.
NA
side-whiskers like a bull fighter appeared behind his master; a sallow,
furtive fellow with whom I determined I should never feel at ease.
However, the Colonel greeted us heartily enough, and conducted us
through a kind of paved, covered courtyard into a great lofty hall.
Indeed it more closely resembled a studio, being partly lighted by a
most curious dome. It was furnished in a manner quite un-English, but
very luxuriously. A magnificent oaken staircase communicated with a
gallery on the left, and at the foot of this staircase, in a mechanical
chair which she managed with astonishing dexterity, sat Madame de
StÃ¤mer.
She had snow-white hair crowning the face of a comparatively young
woman, and large, dark-brown eyes which reminded me strangely of the
eyes of some animal although in the first moment of meeting I could not
identify the resemblance. Her hands were very slender and beautiful, and
when, as the Colonel presented us, she extended her fingers, I was not
surprised to see Harley stoop and kiss them in Continental fashion;
for this Madame evidently expected. I followed suit; but truth to tell,
after that first glance at the masterful figure in the invalid chair I
had had no eyes for Madame de StÃ¤mer, being fully employed in gazing at
someone who stood beside her.
This was an evasively pretty girl, or such was my first impression. That
is to say, that whilst her attractiveness was beyond dispute, analysis
of her small features failed to detect from which particular quality
this charm was derived. The contour of her face certainly formed a
delightful oval, and there was a wistful look in her eyes which was half
appealing and half impish. Her demure expression was not convincing, and
there rested a vague smile, or promise of a smile, upon lips which were
perfectly moulded, and indeed the only strictly regular feature of a
nevertheless bewitching face. She had slightly curling hair and the line
of her neck and shoulder was most graceful and charming. Of one thing I
was sure: She was glad to see visitors at Crayâ€™s Folly.
NA
Madame, my cousin, permit me to present you to Miss Val Beverley, my

The girl bowed in a formal English fashion, which contrasted sharply
with the Continental manner of Madame. Her face flushed slightly, and as
I met her glance she lowered her eyes.

She waved her white hand coquettishly, and ignoring the proffered aid
of Miss Beverley, wheeled her chair away at a great rate under a sort
of arch on the right of the hall, which communicated with the domestic
offices of the establishment.
NA

the chauffeur, the latter carrying our grips. â€œMany women would be

Harley and I had been placed in adjoining rooms. I had never seen such
rooms as those in Crayâ€™s Folly. The place contained enough oak to have
driven a modern builder crazy. Oak had simply been lavished upon it. My
own room, which was almost directly above the box hedge to which I have
referred, had a beautiful carved ceiling and a floor as highly polished
as that of a ballroom. It was tastefully furnished, but the foreign note
was perceptible everywhere.
NA
the view from the great, high, wide window was a very fine one.
I perceived that the grounds of Crayâ€™s Folly were extensive and
carefully cultivated. I had a glimpse of a Tudor sunken garden, but the
best view of this was from the window of Harleyâ€™s room, which because
it was the end room on the north front overlooked another part of the
grounds, and offered a prospect of the east lawns and distant park land.
When presently Colonel Menendez and I accompanied my friend there I
was charmed by the picturesque scene below. Here was a real old herbal
garden, gay with flowers and intersected by tiled moss-grown paths.
There were bushes exhibiting fantastic examples of the topiary art, and
here, too, was a sun-dial. My first impression of this beautiful spot
was one of delight. Later I was to regard that enchanted demesne with
something akin to horror; but as we stood there watching a gardener
clipping the bushes I thought that although Crayâ€™s Folly might be
adjudged ugly, its grounds were delightful.
NA
enquired. â€œIt is not visible from the front of the house, nor from the

subject, which evidently was not altogether pleasing to our host. I
concluded that he had found the east wing of the house something of a
white elephant, and was accordingly sensitive upon the point.
Presently, then, he left us and I returned to my own room, but before
long I rejoined Harley. I did not knock but entered unceremoniously.
NA
He was standing staring out of the window, nor did he turn as I entered.
NA
He glanced at me oddly.
NA
NA
Familiarity with crime in many guises and under many skies had developed
in Paul Harley a sort of sixth sense. It was a fugitive, fickle
thing, as are all the powers which belong to the realm of genius or
inspiration. Often enough it failed him entirely, he had assured me,
that odd, sudden chill as of an abrupt lowering of the temperature,
which, I understood, often advised him of the nearness of enmity
actively malignant.
Now, standing at the window, looking down into that old-world garden, he
NA
was sheer intuition, perhaps, but whilst he could never rely upon its
answering his summons, once active it never misled him.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Paul Harley reflected for a moment, then:

Harley shook his head.

 he replied, â€œbut the danger does not come from there. Let us go down to

CHAPTER V
VAL BEVERLEY
The luncheon was so good as to be almost ostentatious. One could not
have lunched better at the Carlton. Yet, since this luxurious living was
evidently customary in the colonelâ€™s household, a charge of ostentation
would not have been deserved. The sinister-looking Pedro proved to be
an excellent servant; and because of the excitement of feeling myself
to stand upon the edge of unusual things, the enjoyment of a perfectly
served repast, and the sheer delight which I experienced in watching the
play of expression upon the face of Miss Beverley, I count that luncheon
at Crayâ€™s Folly a memorable hour of my life.
Frankly, Val Beverley puzzled me. It may or may not have been curious,
that amidst such singular company I selected for my especial study a
girl so freshly and typically English. I had thought at the moment of
meeting her that she was provokingly pretty; I determined, as the lunch
proceeded, that she was beautiful. Once I caught Harley smiling at me in
his quizzical fashion, and I wondered guiltily if I were displaying an
undue interest in the companion of Madame.
Many topics were discussed, I remember, and beyond doubt the colonelâ€™s
cousin-housekeeper dominated the debate. She possessed extraordinary
force of personality. Her English was not nearly so fluent as that
spoken by the colonel, but this handicap only served to emphasize the
masculine strength of her intellect. Truly she was a remarkable woman.
With her blanched hair and her young face, and those fine, velvety eyes
which possessed a quality almost hypnotic, she might have posed for the
figure of a sorceress. She had unfamiliar gestures and employed her long
white hands in a manner that was new to me and utterly strange.
I could detect no family resemblance between the cousins, and I wondered
if their kinship were very distant. One thing was evident enough: Madame
de StÃ¤mer was devoted to the Colonel. Her expression when she looked at
him changed entirely. For a woman of such intense vitality her eyes were
uncannily still; that is to say that whilst she frequently moved her
head she rarely moved her eyes. Again and again I found myself wondering
where I had seen such eyes before. I lived to identify that memory, as I
shall presently relate.
In vain I endeavoured to define the relationship between these three
people, so incongruously set beneath one roof. Of the fact that Miss
Beverly was not happy I became assured. But respecting her exact
position in the household I was reduced to surmises.
The Colonel improved on acquaintance. I decided that he belonged to an
order of Spanish grandees now almost extinct. I believed he would have
made a very staunch friend; I felt sure he would have proved a most
implacable enemy. Altogether, it was a memorable meal, and one notable
result of that brief companionship was a kind of link of understanding
between myself and Miss Beverley.
Once, when I had been studying Madame de StÃ¤mer, and again, as I removed
my glance from the dark face of Colonel Menendez, I detected the girl
NA
Some things perhaps I did understand, but how few the near future was to
show.
The signal for our departure from table was given by Madame de StÃ¤mer.
She whisked her chair back with extraordinary rapidity, the contrast
between her swift, nervous movements and those still, basilisk eyes
being almost uncanny.
NA
garden, no doubt. I must be away for my afternoon siesta. Come, my

lingered upon the graceful figure of Val Beverley until both she and
Madame were out of sight.

NA
Harley, unseen by the Colonel, glanced at me in a way which I knew.
NA

NA
host.
NA
NA
As I walked out into the bright sunshine I wondered why Paul Harley had
wished to be left alone with Colonel Menendez, but knowing that I should
learn his motive later, I strolled on through the gardens, my mind
filled with speculations respecting these unusual people with whom Fate
had brought me in contact. I felt that Miss Beverley needed protection
of some kind, and I was conscious of a keen desire to afford her that
protection. In her glance I had read, or thought I had read, an appeal
for sympathy.
Not the least mystery of Crayâ€™s Folly was the presence of this girl.
Only toward the end of luncheon had I made up my mind upon a point which
had been puzzling me. Val Beverleyâ€™s gaiety was a cloak. Once I had
detected her watching Madame de StÃ¤mer with a look strangely like that
of fear.
Puffing contentedly at my cigar I proceeded to make a tour of the house.
It was constructed irregularly. Practically the entire building was
of gray stone, which created a depressing effect even in the blazing
sunlight, lending Crayâ€™s Folly something of an austere aspect. There
were fine lofty windows, however, to most of the ground-floor rooms
overlooking the lawns, and some of those above had balconies of the same
gray stone. Quite an extensive kitchen garden and a line of glasshouses
adjoined the west wing, and here were outbuildings, coach-houses and a
garage, all connected by a covered passage with the servantsâ€™ quarters.
Pursuing my enquiries, I proceeded to the north front of the building,
which was closely hemmed in by trees, and which as we had observed on
our arrival resembled the entrance to a monastery.
Passing the massive oaken door by which we had entered and which was now
closed again, I walked on through the opening in the box hedge into a
part of the grounds which was not so sprucely groomed as the rest. On
one side were the yews flanking the Tudor garden and before me uprose
the famous tower. As I stared up at the square structure, with its
uncurtained windows, I wondered, as others had wondered before me, what
could have ever possessed any man to build it.
Visible at points for many miles around, it undoubtedly disfigured an
otherwise beautiful landscape.
I pressed on, noting that the windows of the rooms in the east wing were
shuttered and the apartments evidently disused. I came to the base of
the tower, To the south, the country rose up to the highest point in
the crescent of hills, and peeping above the trees at no great distance
away, I detected the red brick chimneys of some old house in the woods.
North and east, velvet sward swept down to the park.
As I stood there admiring the prospect and telling myself that no
Voodoo devilry could find a home in this peaceful English countryside,
I detected a faint sound of voices far above. Someone had evidently come
out upon the gallery of the tower. I looked upward, but I could not see
the speakers. I pursued my stroll, until, near the eastern base of the
tower, I encountered a perfect thicket of rhododendrons. Finding no
path through this shrubbery, I retraced my steps, presently entering
the Tudor garden; and there strolling toward me, a book in her hand, was
Miss Beverley.
NA
NA
NA
She dropped down upon a grassy bank, looking up at me invitingly, and I
accepted the invitation without demur.
NA
no older than the rest of the place. I always think there should be
NA
NA
NA
She met my glance soberly for a moment and then burst into a peal of
merry laughter.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
She smiled, shook her head, and changed the subject.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Val Beverley nodded slowly, and her glance grew oddly retrospective.
â€œI lived for over a year with Madame de StÃ¤mer in a little villa on
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes. Poor Madame. The hospital of which she was in charge was bombed
and the shock left her as you see her. I was there, too, but I luckily
NA
NA
â€œYes. That was where I first met Madame de StÃ¤mer. She used to be very
wealthy, you see, and she established this hospital in France at her own
expense, and I was one of her assistants for a time. She lost both her
husband and her fortune in the war, and as if that were not bad enough,
NA
NA
NA
NA
Her face grew sweetly animated as she bent toward me excitedly and
confidentially.
â€œReally, she is simply wonderful. I learned to respect her in those days
as I have never respected any other woman in the world; and when, after
all her splendid work, she, so vital and active, was stricken down like
that, I felt that I simply could not leave her, especially as she asked
NA
NA
NA
She hesitated, and glanced at me curiously.
NA
NA
NA
Again she hesitated.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œOh, in a silly, womanish sort of way. Of course she is a wonderful
manager; she rules the house with a rod of iron. But really I havenâ€™t
anything to do here, and I feel frightfully out of place sometimes. Then
NA
NA
NA
NA
A change came over the girlâ€™s face; a look almost of dread.
NA
NA
â€œNaturally I am. Sometimes I have been so frightened that I have made up
NA
NA
curiosity.
NA
NA
She looked up at me swiftly, then turned her head aside, and bit her
lip.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
She shook her head.
â€œNo. There was only poor daddy, and he died over two years ago. That was
NA
NA
their undue familiarity.
An apology was on the tip of my tongue, but Miss Beverley did not seem
to have noticed the indiscretion. Indeed my sympathy was sincere, and I
think she had appreciated the fact.
She looked up again with a bright smile.
â€œWhy are we talking about such depressing things on this simply heavenly
NA
NA
NA
curtsey.
Thereupon we set out, and at every step I found a new delight in some
wayward curl, in a gesture, in the sweet voice of my companion. Her
merry laugh was music, but in wistful mood I think she was even more
alluring.
The menace, if menace there were, which overhung Crayâ€™s Folly, ceased to
exist--for me, at least, and I blessed the lucky chance which had led to
my presence there.
We were presently rejoined by Colonel Menendez and Paul Harley, and I
gathered that my surmise that it had been their voices which I had heard
proceeding from the top of the tower to have been only partly accurate.

had employed a slang term.

Val Beverley smiled and walked away swinging her book, at the same time
treating me to a glance which puzzled me considerably. I wondered if I
had mistaken its significance, for it had seemed to imply that she had
accepted me as an ally. Certainly it served to awaken me to the fact
that I had discovered a keen personal interest in the mystery which hung
over this queerly assorted household.
I glanced at my friend as the Colonel led the way into the house. I
saw him staring upward with a peculiar expression upon his face, and
following the direction of his glance I could see an awning spread over
one of the gray-stone balconies. Beneath it, reclining in a long cane
chair, lay Madame de StÃ¤mer. I think she was asleep; at any rate,
she gave no sign, but lay there motionless, as Harley and I walked in
through the open French window followed by Colonel Menendez.
Odd and unimportant details sometimes linger long in the memory. And
I remember noticing that a needle of sunlight, piercing a crack in the
gaily-striped awning rested upon a ring which Madame wore, so that the
diamonds glittered like sparks of white-hot fire.
CHAPTER VI
THE BARRIER
Colonel Menendez conducted us to a long, lofty library in which might
be detected the same note of un-English luxury manifested in the other
appointments of the house. The room, in common with every other which
I had visited in Crayâ€™s Folly, was carried out in oak: doors, window
frames, mantelpiece, and ceiling representing fine examples of this
massive woodwork. Indeed, if the eccentricity of the designer of Crayâ€™s
Folly were not sufficiently demonstrated by the peculiar plan of the
building, its construction wholly of granite and oak must have remarked
him a man of unusual if substantial ideas.
There were four long windows opening on to a veranda which commanded a
view of part of the rose garden and of three terraced lawns descending
to a lake upon which I perceived a number of swans. Beyond, in the
valley, lay verdant pastures, where cattle grazed. A lark hung carolling
blithely far above, and the sky was almost cloudless. I could hear a
steam reaper at work somewhere in the distance. This, with the more
intimate rattle of a lawn-mower wielded by a gardener who was not
visible from where I stood, alone disturbed the serene silence, except
that presently I detected the droning of many bees among the roses.
Sunlight flooded the prospect; but the veranda lay in shadow, and that
long, oaken room was refreshingly cool and laden with the heavy perfume
of the flowers.
From the windows, then, one beheld a typical English summer-scape, but
the library itself struck an altogether more exotic note. There were
many glazed bookcases of a garish design in ebony and gilt, and these
were laden with a vast collection of works in almost every European
language, reflecting perhaps the cosmopolitan character of the colonelâ€™s
household. There was strange Spanish furniture upholstered in perforated
leather and again displaying much gilt. There were suits of black armour
and a great number of Moorish ornaments. The pictures were fine but
sombre, and all of the Spanish school.
One Velasquez in particular I noted with surprise, reflecting that,
assuming it to be an authentic work of the master, my entire worldly
possessions could not have enabled me to buy it. It was the portrait
of a typical Spanish cavalier and beyond doubt a Menendez. In fact, the
resemblance between the haughty Spanish grandee, who seemed about
to step out of the canvas and pick a quarrel with the spectator, and
Colonel Don Juan himself was almost startling. Evidently, our host had
imported most of his belongings from Cuba.
NA
beg. All my poor establishment contains is for your entertainment and
NA
He drew up two long, low lounge chairs, the arms provided with
receptacles to contain cooling drinks; and the mere sight of these
chairs mentally translated me to the Spanish Main, where I pictured them
set upon the veranda of that hacienda which had formerly been our hostâ€™s
residence.
Harley and I became seated and Colonel Menendez disposed himself upon a
leather-covered couch, nodding apologetically as he did so.
â€œMy health requires that I should recline for a certain number of hours

I was certainly unfamiliar with the liqueur which he insisted we must
taste, and which was contained in a sort of square, opaque bottle
unknown, I think, to English wine merchants. Beyond doubt it was potent
stuff; and some cigars which the Spaniard produced on this occasion and
which were enclosed in little glass cylinders resembling test-tubes and
elaborately sealed, I recognized to be priceless. They convinced me, if
conviction had not visited me already, that Colonel Don Juan Sarmiento
Menendez belonged to that old school of West Indian planters by whom
the tradition of the Golden Americas had been for long preserved in the
Spanish Main.
We discussed indifferent matters for a while, sipping this wonderful
curaÃ§ao of our hostâ€™s. The effect created by the Colonelâ€™s story faded
entirely, and when, the latter being unable to conceal his drowsiness,
Harley stood up, I took the hint with gratitude; for at that moment I
did not feel in the mood to discuss serious business or indeed business
of any kind.
NA

Harley and I walked out into the garden together, our courteous host
standing in the open window, and bowing in that exaggerated fashion
which in another might have been ridiculous but which was possible in
Colonel Menendez, because of the peculiar grace of deportment which was
his.
As we descended the steps I turned and glanced back, I know not why. But
the impression which I derived of the Colonelâ€™s face as he stood there
in the shadow of the veranda was one I can never forget.
His expression had changed utterly, or so it seemed to me. He no longer
resembled Velasquezâ€™ haughty cavalier; gone, too, was the debonnaire
bearing, I turned my head aside swiftly, hoping that he had not detected
my backward glance.
I felt that I had violated hospitality. I felt that I had seen what I
should not have seen. And the result was to bring about that which no
story of West Indian magic could ever have wrought in my mind.
A dreadful, cold premonition claimed me, a premonition that this was a
doomed man.
The look which I had detected upon his face was an indefinable, an
indescribable look; but I had seen it in the eyes of one who had been
bitten by a poisonous reptile and who knew his hours to be numbered. It
was uncanny, unnerving; and whereas at first the atmosphere of Colonel
Menendezâ€™s home had seemed to be laden with prosperous security, now
that sense of ease and restfulness was gone--and gone for ever.

as it is humanly possible to be sure of anything that whatever Colonel

Harley nodded rapidly.
NA

He glanced at me swiftly, and his bronzed face wore a peculiar
expression.

NA
NA
â€œI remember perfectly well, but I thought you might have just met. Now
it appears to me, Knox, that you have quickly established yourself in
the good books of a very charming girl. My only reason for visiting

reminding you of the fact that she has been on intimate terms with
Madame de StÃ¤mer for some years, I will not intrude in any way upon your

uniformity which is monotonous, and an unimaginative scheme of

NA
I paused, staring up the hillside, but Harley, hands locked behind
him and chin lowered reflectively, was pacing on. I joined him, and we
proceeded for some little distance in silence, passing a gardener who
touched his cap respectfully and to whom I thought at first my companion
was about to address some remark. Harley passed on, however, still
occupied, it seemed, with his reflections, and coming to a gravel path
which, bordering one side of the lawns, led down from terrace to terrace
into the valley, turned, and began to descend.

CHAPTER VII
AT THE LAVENDER ARMS
In certain moods Paul Harley was impossible as a companion, and I,
who knew him well, had learned to leave him to his own devices at such
times. These moods invariably corresponded with his meeting some problem
to the heart of which the lance of his keen wit failed to penetrate.
His humour might not display itself in the spoken word, he merely became
oblivious of everything and everybody around him. People might talk to
him and he scarce noted their presence, familiar faces appear and he
would see them not. Outwardly he remained the observant Harley who
could see further into a mystery than any other in England, but his
observation was entirely introspective; although he moved amid the
hustle of life he was spiritually alone, communing with the solitude
which dwells in every manâ€™s heart.
Presently, then, as we came to the lake at the foot of the sloping
lawns, where water lilies were growing and quite a number of swans had
their habitation, I detected the fact that I had ceased to exist so
far as Harley was concerned. Knowing this mood of old, I pursued my way
alone, pressing on across the valley and making for a swing gate which
seemed to open upon a public footpath. Coming to this gate I turned and
looked back.
Paul Harley was standing where I had left him by the edge of the lake,
staring as if hypnotized at the slowly moving swans. But I would have
been prepared to wager that he saw neither swans nor lake, but mentally
was far from the spot, deep in some complex maze of reflection through
which no ordinary mind could hope to follow him.
I glanced at my watch and found that it was but little after two
oâ€™clock. Luncheon at Crayâ€™s Folly was early. I therefore had some time
upon my hands and I determined to employ it in exploring part of the
neighbourhood. Accordingly I filled and lighted my pipe and strolled
leisurely along the footpath, enjoying the beauty of the afternoon, and
admiring the magnificent timber which grew upon the southerly slopes of
the valley.
Larks sang high above me and the air was fragrant with those wonderful
earthy scents which belong to an English countryside. A herd of very
fine Jersey cattle presently claimed inspection, and a little farther on
I found myself upon a high road where a brown-faced fellow seated aloft
upon a hay-cart cheerily gave me good-day as I passed.
Quite at random I turned to the left and followed the road, so that
presently I found myself in a very small village, the principal building
NA
Colonel Menendezâ€™s curaÃ§ao, combined with the heat of the day, had made
me thirsty; for which reason I stepped into the bar-parlour determined
to sample the local ale. I wars served by the landlady, a neat, round,
red little person, and as she retired, having placed a foam-capped mug
upon the counter, her glance rested for a moment upon the only other
occupant of the room, a man seated in an armchair immediately to the
right of the door. A glass of whisky stood on the window ledge at his
elbow, and that it was by no means the first which he had imbibed, his
appearance seemed to indicate.
Having tasted the cool contents of my mug, I leaned back against the
counter and looked at this person curiously.
He was apparently of about medium height, but of a somewhat fragile
appearance. He was dressed like a country gentleman, and a stick and
soft hat lay upon the ledge near his glass. But the thing about him
which had immediately arrested my attention was his really extraordinary
resemblance to Paul Harleyâ€™s engraving of Edgar Allan Poe.
I wondered at first if Harleyâ€™s frequent references to the eccentric
American genius, to whom he accorded a sort of hero-worship, were
responsible for my imagining a close resemblance where only a slight one
existed. But inspection of that strange, dark face convinced me of
the fact that my first impression had been a true one. Perhaps, in my
curiosity, I stared rather rudely.
NA
note that he spoke with a faint American accent, â€œbut are you a literary
NA
As I had judged to be the case, he was slightly bemused, but by no
means drunk, and although his question was abrupt it was spoken civilly
enough.
NA
replied, lightly.
NA
NA
The other wagged his head slowly and took a drink of whisky.
NA
NA
NA
clearly resemble him in more ways than one. I must really ask you to
NA
NA
glass, and I should be honoured if you would permit me to replenish
NA
NA
NA
NA
He stepped up to the counter and rapped upon it with half a crown, until
the landlady appeared. She treated me to a pathetic glance, but refilled
the empty glass.
My American acquaintance having returned to his seat and having added a
very little water to the whisky went on:
NA
Virginia, United States of America, but now of the Guest House, Surrey,
NA
Taking my cue from Mr. Camberâ€™s gloomy but lofty manner, I bowed
formally and mentioned my name.
NA
â€œand now, sir, to answer your question. When you came in a few moments
ago you glanced at me. Your eyes did not open widely as is the case
when one recognizes, or thinks one recognizes, an acquaintance, they
narrowed. This indicated retrospection. For a moment they turned aside.
You were focussing a fugitive idea, a memory. You captured it. You
looked at me again, and your successive glances read as follows: The
hair worn uncommonly long, the mathematical brow, the eyes of a poet,
the slight moustache, small mouth, weak chin; the glass at his elbow.
The resemblance is complete. Knowing how complete it is myself, sir, I
NA
Now, as Mr. Colin Camber had thus spoken in the serious manner of a
slightly drunken man, I had formed the opinion that I stood in the
presence of a very singular character. Here was that seeming mÃ©salliance
which not infrequently begets genius: a powerful and original mind
allied to a weak will. I wondered what Mr. Colin Camberâ€™s occupation
might be, and somewhat, too, I wondered why his name was unfamiliar to
me. For that the possessor of that brow and those eyes could fail to
make his mark in any profession which he might take up I was unwilling
to believe.
NA
NA
NA
fellowmen, a study which I have pursued in various parts of the world
NA
He contemplated me with a look which had grown suddenly pathetic.
NA
NA
 He emptied his glass at a draught. â€œSurely, Mr. Knox, you are going
to replenish? Whilst you are doing so, would you kindly request Mrs.
NA
But at that moment Mrs. Wootton in person appeared behind the counter.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
genially, â€œwe must bow to the law, I suppose. At least we are better off
NA
NA
speaking the words as though they possessed some deep dramatic
significance. â€œYes, but such laws are an insult to every intelligent
NA
He sat down again rather heavily, and I stood looking from him to the
landlady, and wondering what I should do. The matter was decided for
me, however, in a way which I could never have foreseen. For, hearing
a light footfall upon the step which led up to the bar-parlour, I
turned--and there almost beside me stood a wrinkled little Chinaman!
 He wore a blue suit and a tweed cap, he wore queer, thick-soled
slippers, and his face was like a smiling mask hewn out of very old
ivory. I could scarcely credit the evidence of my senses, since the
Lavender Arms was one of the last places in which I should have looked
for a native of China.
Mr. Colin Camber rose again, and fixing his melancholy eyes upon the
newcomer:
NA
Quite unmoved the Chinaman replied:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
He stood very upright for a moment, his gaze set upon the wrinkled
Chinese face. Then he looked at Mrs. Wootton and bowed, and looked at me
and bowed, very stiffly.
NA
NA
I returned his bow, and as he walked quite steadily toward the door,
followed by Ah Tsong, he paused, turned, and said: â€œMr. Knox, I should
esteem it a friendly action if you would spare me an hour of your
company before you leave Surrey. My visitors are few. Any one, any one,
will direct you to the Guest House. I am persuaded that we have much in

He went down the steps, disappearing in company with the Chinaman,
and having watched them go, I turned to Mrs. Wootton, the landlady, in
silent astonishment.
She nodded her head and sighed.
NA
NA
â€œDo you mean that Mr. Camber comes here every day and is always fetched

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
inquire.
â€œIt was about three years ago, sir, that he took the old Guest House at
Mid-Hatton. I remember the time well enough because of all the trouble
NA
NA
NA
â€œOh, no, sir, only ten rooms and a garden, and it had been vacant for a

NA
NA
Mrs. Wootton, having cleared the counter, glanced up at the clock and
then at me with a cheery but significant smile.
NA
NA
NA
â€œChinamen and Spanish men and what-not. If some of the old gentry that
lived here before the war could see it, they wouldnâ€™t recognize the

NA
NA
â€œOh, itâ€™s a fact, believe me. Just in the last six months or so he has
started on the rampage like, but some of the people he has met in here

NA
NA
a certain indignation. â€œHe either does not remember what he says or does
when he is in drink, or he pretends he doesnâ€™t. Oh, dear, itâ€™s a funny
NA
NA
NA
certainly it would seem that this quiet spot in the Surrey Hills had
become a rallying ground for peculiar people.
CHAPTER VIII
THE CALL OF Mâ€™KOMBO
Of tea upon the veranda of Crayâ€™s Folly that afternoon I retain several
notable memories. I got into closer touch with my host and hostess,
without achieving anything like a proper understanding of either of
them, and I procured a new viewpoint of Miss Val Beverley. Her repose
was misleading. She deliberately subjugated her own vital personality to
that of Madame de StÃ¤mer, why, I knew not, unless she felt herself under
an obligation to do so. That her blue-gray eyes could be wistful was
true enough, they could also be gay; and once I detected in them a
look of sadness which dispelled the butterfly illusion belonging to her
dainty slenderness, to her mobile lips, to the vagabond curling hair of
russet brown.
Paul Harleyâ€™s manner remained absent, but I who knew his moods so well
recognized that this abstraction was no longer real. It was a pose
which he often adopted when in reality he was keenly interested in
his surroundings. It baffled me, however, as effectively as it baffled
others, and whilst at one moment I decided that he was studying Colonel
Menendez, in the next I became convinced that Madame de StÃ¤mer was the
subject upon his mental dissecting table.
That he should find in Madame a fascinating problem did not surprise me.
She must have afforded tempting study for any psychologist. I could
not fathom the nature of the kinship existing between herself and the
Spanish colonel, for Madame de StÃ¤mer was French to her fingertips.
Her expressions, her gestures, her whole outlook on life proclaimed the
fashionable Parisienne.
She possessed a vigorous masculine intelligence and was the most
entertaining companion imaginable. She was daringly outspoken, and it
was hard to believe that her gaiety was forced. Yet, as the afternoon
wore on, I became more and more convinced that such was the case.
I thought that before affliction visited her Madame de StÃ¤mer must have
been a vivacious and a beautiful woman. Her vivacity remained and much
of her beauty, so that it was difficult to believe her snow-white hair
to be a product of nature. Again and again I found myself regarding it
as a powdered coiffure of the Pompadour period and wondering why Madame
wore no patches.
That a deep and sympathetic understanding existed between herself and
Colonel Menendez was unmistakable. More than once I intercepted glances
from the dark eyes of Madame which were lover-like, yet laden with a
profound sorrow. She was playing a rÃ´le, and I was convinced that Harley
knew this. It was not merely a courageous fight against affliction on
the part of a woman of the world, versed in masking her real self from
the prying eyes of society, it was a studied performance prompted by
some deeper motive.
She dressed with exquisite taste, and to see her seated there amid her
cushions, gesticulating vivaciously, one would never have supposed that
she was crippled. My admiration for her momentarily increased, the more
so since I could see that she was sincerely fond of Val Beverley, whose
every movement she followed with looks of almost motherly affection.
This was all the more strange as Madame de StÃ¤mer whose age, I supposed,
lay somewhere on the sunny side of forty, was of a type which expects,
and wins, admiration, long after the average woman has ceased to be
attractive.
One endowed with such a temperament is as a rule unreasonably jealous
of youth and good looks in another. I could not determine if Madameâ€™s
attitude were to be ascribed to complacent self-satisfaction or to a
nobler motive. It sufficed for me that she took an unfeigned joy in the
youthful sweetness of her companion.
NA
NA
She had a rapid way of speaking, and possessed a slightly husky but
fascinatingly vibrant voice.
NA
Val Beverley blushed, and laughed to conceal her embarrassment.
NA
NA
NA
odd contrast to the deeper tones of his cousin. â€œBut it is the scraggy

NA
NA
NA

Madame shrugged her shoulders.

Paul Harley aroused himself and laughed heartily.
NA

NA

NA
NA
direction; â€œbut how would you like to be surrounded by a lot of drabs,
NA
Colonel Menendez, the fingers half closed, in a gesture which curiously
reminded me of Sarah Bernhardt, â€œthat man would notice if a parlourmaid
came into the room with a shoe unbuttoned. Poof! if we love elegance it
NA
Colonel Menendez bent across the table and kissed the white fingers in
his courtier-like fashion.
NA
Madame smiled and flushed like a girl, but withdrawing her hand she
shrugged.
NA
During this little scene I detected Val Beverley looking at me in a
vaguely troubled way, and it was easy to guess that she was wondering
what construction I should place upon it. However:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
She rang a little bell which stood upon the tea-table beside the urn,
and Pedro came out through the drawing room.
NA
The Spanish butler bowed.
NA
NA
Thereupon she whisked her mechanical chair about, waved her hand to
dismiss Pedro, and went steering through the drawing room at a great
rate, with Val Beverley walking beside her.
As we resumed our seats Colonel Menendez lay back with half-closed
eyes, his glance following the chair and its occupant until both were
swallowed up in the shadows of the big drawing room.
NA
NA
NA
He passed cigarettes around, of a long kind resembling cheroots
and wrapped in tobacco leaf. I thought it strange that having thus
emphasized Madameâ€™s nationality he did not feel it incumbent upon him to
explain the mystery of their kinship. However, he made no attempt to do
so, and almost before we had lighted up, a racy little two-seater was
driven around the gravel path by Carter, the chauffeur who had brought
us to Crayâ€™s Folly from London.
The man descended and began to arrange wraps and cushions, and a few
moments later back came Madame again, dressed for driving. Carter
was about to lift her into the car when Colonel Menendez stood up and
advanced.
NA
A look of keen anxiety, I had almost said of pain, leapt into her eyes,
and the Colonel hesitated.
NA
NA
Colonel Menendez accepted the rebuke humbly, but the incident struck
me as grotesque; for it was difficult to associate delicacy with such a
fine specimen of well-preserved manhood as the Colonel.
However, Carter performed the duty of assisting Madame into her little
car, and when for a moment he supported her upright, before placing
her among the cushions, I noted that she was a tall woman, slender and
elegant.
All smiles and light, sparkling conversation, she settled herself
comfortably at the wheel and Val Beverley got in beside her. Madame
nodded to Carter in dismissal, waved her hand to Colonel Menendez, cried

Our host stood bare-headed upon the veranda listening to the sound
of the engine dying away among the trees. He seemed to be lost in
reflection from which he only aroused himself when the purr of the motor
became inaudible.
NA

Paul Harley flicked ash from the end of his cigarette.
NA
NA
becoming momentarily agitated.
He looked at Harley as though he suspected the latter of possessing
private information.
NA
agencies inimical to your safety are focussed upon the house your own
NA
Colonel Menendez seemed to be on the point of speaking again, but he
checked himself and in silence led the way through the ornate library
to a smaller room which opened out of it, and which was furnished as a
study.
Here the motif was distinctly one of officialdom. Although the Southern
element was not lacking, it was not so marked as in the library or in
the hall. The place was appointed for utility rather than ornament.
Everything was in perfect order. In the library, with the blinds drawn,
one might have supposed oneself in Trinidad; in the study, under similar
conditions, one might equally well have imagined Downing Street to lie
outside the windows. Essentially, this was the workroom of a man of
affairs.
Having settled ourselves comfortably, Paul Harley opened the
conversation.

NA
He consulted the back of an envelope, upon which, I presumed during the
afternoon, he had made a number of pencilled notes.

NA
NA
â€œAh, before the full moon. And because you associate the activities of
Voodoo with the full moon, you believe that the old menace has again

The Colonel nodded emphatically. He was busily engaged in rolling one of
his eternal cigarettes.
â€œThis belief of yours was recently confirmed by the discovery of the bat

NA
NA

expressed in words would amount to this: During your last visit to Cuba
you (_a_) either killed some high priest of Voodoo, or (_b_) seriously
injured him? Assuming the first theory to be the correct one, your death
was determined upon by the sect over which he had formerly presided.
Assuming the second to be accurate, however, it is presumably the man
himself for whom we must look. Now, Colonel Menendez, kindly inform me
NA
NA
NA
â€œAssuming that he is still alive, what, roughly, would his age be

The Colonel seemed to meditate, pushing a box of long Martinique cigars
across the table in my direction.

angrily at Harley.

as he stood looking down upon my friend that I had rarely seen a more

Paul Harley had roused him unaccountably, and knowing my friend for a

could not even dimly perceive his object.
NA

mental opposition to this danger which threatens has become slackened.

apathetic. To come to my last point. You spoke of a neighbour in terms
which led me to suppose that you suspected him of some association with

Colonel Menendez sat down again, puffing furiously at his cigarette,
whilst beginning to roll another. He was much disturbed, was fighting to
regain mastery of himself.

hut, she wandered out in her sleep and visited the Black Belt. Can you

He spoke the words with a sort of lofty finality, and accompanied them
with a gesture of the hands which really left Harley no alternative but
to drop the subject.
Again their glances met, and it was patent to me that underlying all
this conversation was something beyond my ken. What it was that Harley
suspected I could not imagine, nor what it was that Colonel Menendez
desired to conceal; but tension was in the very air. The Spaniard was on
the defensive, and Paul Harley was puzzled, irritated.
It was a strange interview, and one which in the light of after events
I recognized to possess extraordinary significance. That sixth sense of
Harleyâ€™s was awake, was prompting him, but to what extent he understood
its promptings at that hour I did not know, and have never known to
this day. Intuitively, I believe, as he sat there staring at Colonel
Menendez, he began to perceive the shadow within a shadow which was the
secret of Crayâ€™s Folly, which was the thing called Bat Wing, which was
the devilish force at that very hour alive and potent in our midst.
CHAPTER IX
OBEAH
This conversation in Colonel Menendezâ€™s study produced a very unpleasant
impression upon my mind. The atmosphere of Crayâ€™s Folly seemed to become
charged with unrest. Of Madame de StÃ¤mer and Miss Beverley I saw nothing
up to the time that I retired to dress. Having dressed I walked into
Harleyâ€™s room, anxious to learn if he had formed any theory to account
for the singular business which had brought us to Surrey.
Harley had excused himself directly we had left the study, stating that
he wished to get to the village post-office in time to send a telegram
to London. Our host had suggested a messenger, but this, as well as the
offer of a car, Harley had declined, saying that the exercise would aid
reflection. Nevertheless, I was surprised to find his room empty, for I
could not imagine why the sending of a telegram should have detained him
so long.
Dusk was falling, and viewed from the open window the Tudor garden below
looked very beautiful, part of it lying in a sort of purplish shadow
and the rest being mystically lighted as though viewed through a golden
veil. To the whole picture a sort of magic quality was added by a speck
of high-light which rested upon the face of the old sun-dial.
I thought that here was a fit illustration for a fairy tale; then I
remembered the Colonelâ€™s account of how he had awakened in the act
of entering this romantic plaisance, and I was touched anew by an
unrestfulness, by a sense of the uncanny.
I observed a book lying upon the dressing table, and concluding that it
was one which Harley had brought with him, I took it up, glancing at the
NA
private electric plant in Crayâ€™s Folly, I opened the book at random and
began to read.
NA
more often than not associated with beliefs in witchcraft and in the
rites known as Voodoo or Obi Mysteries. It has been endeavoured by
some students to show that these are relics of the Fetish worship of
equatorial Africa, but such a genealogy has never been satisfactorily
demonstrated. The cannibalistic rituals, human sacrifices, and obscene
ceremonies resembling those of the Black Sabbath of the Middle Ages,
reported to prevail in Haiti and other of the islands, and by some among
the negroes of the Southern States of America, may be said to rest on
doubtful authority. Nevertheless, it is a fact beyond doubt that among
the negroes both of the West Indies and the United States there is a
widespread belief in the powers of the Obeah man. A native who believes
himself to have come under the spell of such a sorcerer will sink into a
NA
At this point I discovered several paragraphs underlined in pencil, and
concluding that the underlining had been done by Paul Harley, I read
them with particular care. They were as follows: â€œAccording to Hesketh
J. Bell, the term Obeah is most probably derived from the substantive
Obi, a word used on the East coast of Africa to denote witchcraft,
sorcery, and fetishism in general. The etymology of Obi has been traced
to a very antique source, stretching far back into Egyptian mythology.
A serpent in the Egyptian language was called Ob or Aub. Obion is still
the Egyptian name for a serpent. Moses, in the name of God, forbade the
Israelites ever to enquire of the demon, Ob, which is translated in our
Bible: Charmer or wizard, divinator or sorcerer. The Witch of Endor is
called Oub or Ob, translated Pythonissa; and Oubois was the name of the
basilisk or royal serpent, emblem of the Sun and an ancient oracular
NA
A paragraph followed which was doubly underlined, and pursuing my
reading I made a discovery which literally caused me to hold my breath.
This is what I read:
â€œIn a recent contribution to the _Occult Review_, Mr. Colin Camber, the
American authority, offered some very curious particulars in support
of a theory to show that whereas snakes and scorpions have always been
recognized as sacred by Voodoo worshippers, the real emblem of their
unclean religion is the bat, especially _the Vampire Bat of South
America._
â€œHe pointed out that the symptoms of one dying beneath the spell of an
Obeah man are closely paralleled in the cases of men and animals who

I laid the open book down upon the bed. My brain was in a tumult.
The several theories, or outlines of theories which hitherto I had
entertained, were, by these simple paragraphs, cast into the utmost
disorder. I thought of the Colonelâ€™s covert references to a neighbour
whom he feared, of his guarded statement that the devotees of Voodoo
were not confined to the West Indies, of the attack upon him in
Washington, of the bat wing pinned to the door of Crayâ€™s Folly.
Incredulously, I thought of my acquaintance of the Lavender Arms, with
his bemused expression and his magnificent brow; and a great doubt and
wonder grew up in my mind.
I became increasingly impatient for the return of Paul Harley. I felt
that a clue of the first importance had fallen into my possession; so
that when, presently, as I walked impatiently up and down the room, the
door opened and Harley entered, I greeted him excitedly.
NA
Even as I spoke and looked into the keen, eager face, the expression
in Harleyâ€™s eyes struck me. I recognized that in him, too, intense
excitement was pent up. Furthermore, he was in one of his irritable
moods. But, full of my own discoveries:

NA
He stared at me queerly.
â€œI discovered the book in my own library after you had gone last night,
Knox, and it was then that I marked the passages which struck me as

â€œWell, just consider the matter for a moment. Do you suppose that

He burst out laughing, his good humour suddenly quite restored, and
taking out his pipe began industriously to load it.

story of the encounter at the Lavender Arms.

Paul Harley took his dinner jacket from the chair upon which the man had
laid it out, and turned to me.

â€œMy retirement will not be voluntary, Knox. I shall be kicked out as
an incompetent ass; for, respecting the connection, if any, between the
narrative of Colonel Menendez, the bat wing nailed to the door of the
house, and Mr. Colin Camber, I have not the foggiest notion. In this, at
last, I have triumphed over Auguste Dupin. Auguste Dupin never confessed

CHAPTER X
THE NIGHT WALKER
If luncheon had seemed extravagant, dinner at Crayâ€™s Folly proved to be
a veritable Roman banquet. To associate ideas of selfishness with Miss
Beverley was hateful, but the more I learned of the luxurious life of
this queer household hidden away in the Surrey Hills the less I wondered
at any oneâ€™s consenting to share such exile. I had hitherto counted an
American freak dinner, organized by a lucky plunger and held at the CafÃ©
de Paris, as the last word in extravagant feasting. But I learned now
that what was caviare in Monte Carlo was ordinary fare at Crayâ€™s Folly.
Colonel Menendez was an epicure with an endless purse. The excellence of
one of the courses upon which I had commented led to a curious incident.
NA
NA
Colonel Menendez bowed in his cavalierly fashion and Madame de StÃ¤mer
positively beamed upon me.
NA
but has no reputation in London. There are hotels that would snap him
NA
I looked at the speaker in surprise.
NA
The Colonel exhibited a momentary embarrassment.
NA
NA
NA
I understood only too well; and recollecting the words spoken by Paul
Harley that afternoon, respecting the Colonelâ€™s will to live, I became
conscious of an uncomfortable sense of chill.
If I had doubted that in so speaking he had been contemplating his own
death, the behaviour of Madame de StÃ¤mer must have convinced me. Her
complexion was slightly but cleverly made up, with all the exquisite
art of the Parisienne, but even through the artificial bloom I saw her
cheeks blanch. Her face grew haggard and her eyes burned unnaturally.
She turned quickly aside to address Paul Harley, but I knew that the
significance of this slight episode had not escaped him.
He was by no means at ease. In the first place, he was badly puzzled;
in the second place, he was angry. He felt it incumbent upon him to save
this man from a menace which he, Paul Harley, evidently recognized to be
real, although to me it appeared wildly chimerical, and the very person
upon whose active coÃ¶peration he naturally counted not only seemed
resigned to his fate, but by deliberate omission of important data added
to Harleyâ€™s difficulties.
How much of this secret drama proceeding in Crayâ€™s Folly was appreciated
by Val Beverley I could not determine. On this occasion, I remember,
she was simply but perfectly dressed and, in my eyes, seemed the most
sweetly desirable woman I had ever known. Realizing that I had already
revealed my interest in the girl, I was oddly self-conscious, and a
hundred times during the progress of dinner I glanced across at Harley,
expecting to detect his quizzical smile. He was very stern, however, and
seemed more reserved than usual. He was uncertain of his ground, I
could see. He resented the understanding which evidently existed between
Colonel Menendez and Madame de StÃ¤mer, and to which, although his aid
had been sought, he was not admitted.
It seemed to me, personally, that an almost palpable shadow lay upon
the room. Although, save for this one lapse, our host throughout talked
gaily and entertainingly, I was obsessed by a memory of the expression
which I had detected upon his face that morning, the expression of a
doomed man.
What, in Heavenâ€™s name, I asked myself, did it all mean? If ever I saw
the fighting spirit looking out of any manâ€™s eyes, it looked out of the
eyes of Don Juan Sarmiento Menendez. Why, then, did he lie down to the
menace of this mysterious Bat Wing, and if he counted opposition futile,
why had he summoned Paul Harley to Crayâ€™s Folly?
With the passing of every moment I sympathized more fully with the
perplexity of my friend, and no longer wondered that even his highly
specialized faculties had failed to detect an explanation.
Remembering Colin Camber as I had seen him at the Lavender Arms, it was
simply impossible to suppose that such a man as Menendez could fear such
a man as Camber. True, I had seen the latter at a disadvantage, and
I knew well enough that many a genius has been also a drunkard. But
although I was prepared to find that Colin Camber possessed genius, I
found it hard to believe that this was of a criminal type. That such a
character could be the representative of some remote negro society was
an idea too grotesque to be entertained for a moment.
I was tempted to believe that his presence in the neighbourhood of this
haunted Cuban was one of those strange coincidences which in criminal
history have sometimes proved so tragic for their victims.
Madame de StÃ¤mer, avoiding the Colonelâ€™s glances, which were
pathetically apologetic, gradually recovered herself, and:
NA
NA
Ignoring a look of entreaty from the blue-gray eyes:
NA
NA
NA
Her reference to a new dress set me speculating again upon the apparent
anomaly of her presence at Crayâ€™s Folly. That she was not a professional
NA
suitably provided for, since she wore such expensively simple gowns. She
had a delightful trick of blushing when attention was focussed upon her,
and said Madame de StÃ¤mer:
â€œTo be able to blush like that I would give my string of pearls--no,
NA
NA
NA
NA
gestures, â€œI blushed my last blush when my second husband introduced me
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
She directed a glance toward him as she spoke those words, and as I had
felt when I had seen his tragic face on the veranda that morning I felt
again in detecting this look of Madame de StÃ¤merâ€™s. The yearning yet
selfless love which it expressed was not for my eyes to witness.
NA
NA
When, at the termination of this truly historic dinner, the ladies left
us:
NA
holding the fingers characteristically curled, â€œno excitement, no
NA
Colonel Menendez bowed deeply, as the invalid wheeled herself from the
room, followed by Miss Beverley. My heart was beating delightfully, for
in the moment of departure the latter had favoured me with a significant
glance, which seemed to say, â€œI am looking forward to a chat with you
NA
NA
â€œtruly I am blessed in the autumn of my life with such charming
companionship. Beauty and wit, youth and discretion. Is he not a happy

The saturnine Pedro entered with some wonderful crusted port, and
Colonel Menendez offered cigars.

NA
have been paid.
He was indeed an inveterate pipe-smoker, and only rarely did he truly
enjoy a cigar, however choice its pedigree. With a sigh of content
he began to fill his briar. His mood was more restful, and covertly I
watched him studying our host. The night remained very warm and one of
the two windows of the dining room, which was the most homely apartment
in Crayâ€™s Folly, was wide open, offering a prospect of sweeping velvet
lawns touched by the magic of the moonlight.
A short silence fell, to be broken by the Colonel.
NA
NA
â€œI could cheerfully pass the rest of my days in such ideal

I nodded in agreement.
NA
to remember that I am here upon business, and that my professional

He stared very hard at Colonel Menendez.
â€œI have spoken with your butler, known as Pedro, and with some of the
other servants, and have learned all that there is to be learned about
the person unknown who gained admittance to the house a month ago, and
NA
NA
He bent forward, resting his elbows upon his knees, a pose which he
frequently adopted. He was smoking a cigar, but his total absorption in
the topic under discussion was revealed by the fact that from a pocket
in his dinner jacket he had taken out a portion of tobacco, had laid
it in a slip of rice paper, and was busily rolling one of his eternal
cigarettes.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Colonel Menendezâ€™s eyes opened very widely, and his face became more
aquiline than ever.
NA
NA
Paul Harley puffed at his pipe. His expression did not alter in the
slightest.
â€œI merely wondered if your suspicions tended in the direction of Mr.

NA
As the Colonel spoke the name either I became victim of a strange
delusion or his face was momentarily convulsed. If my senses served me

to retain composure, and in this he succeeded, for when he spoke again
his voice was quite normal.

NA
NA
NA
â€œI have heard of him, Mr. Harley. But to be perfectly frank, I have
NA
A note of arrogance, which at times crept into his high, thin voice,
became perceptible now, and the aristocratic, aquiline face looked very
supercilious.
How the conversation would have developed I know not, but at this
moment Pedro entered and delivered a message in Spanish to the Colonel,
whereupon the latter arose and with very profuse apologies begged
permission to leave us for a few moments.
When he had retired:
NA
on with your old duties to-day, your new ones do not commence until
NA
With that he laughed and walked out of the dining room, leaving me
wondering whether to be grateful or annoyed. However, it did not take me
long to find my way to the drawing room where the two ladies were seated
side by side upon a settee, Madameâ€™s chair having been wheeled into a
corner.
NA
NA
NA
NA
I laughed, and drew up a chair. Madame de StÃ¤mer was smoking, but Miss
Beverley was not. Accordingly, I offered her a cigarette, which she
accepted, and as I was lighting it with elaborate care, every moment
finding a new beauty in her charming face, Pedro again appeared and
addressed some remark in Spanish to Madame.
NA
The Spanish butler wheeled the chair across to the settee, and lifting
her with an ease which spoke of long practice, placed her amidst the
cushions where she spent so many hours of her life.
NA
feel sure that Mr. Knox will do his very best to make up for my absence.
NA
Pedro holding the door open, she went wheeling out, and I found myself
alone with Val Beverley.
At the time I was much too delighted to question the circumstances which
had led to this tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte, but had I cared to give the matter any
consideration, it must have presented rather curious features. The call
first of host and then of hostess was inconsistent with the courtesy of
the master of Crayâ€™s Folly, which, like the appointments of his home and
his mode of life, was elaborate. But these ideas did not trouble me at
the moment.
Suddenly, however, indeed before I had time to speak, the girl started
and laid her hand upon my arm.
NA
NA
NA
I saw that she had turned pale, I saw the confirmation of something
which I had only partly realised before: that her life at Crayâ€™s Folly
was a constant fight against some haunting shadow. Her gaiety, her
lightness, were but a mask. For now, in those wide-open eyes, I read
absolute horror.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
to sooth her fears.
NA
NA
NA
believe me, I know--I know. I, too, saw the batâ€™s wing nailed to the
door, Mr. Knox. You are surely not going to suggest that this was the
NA
I seated myself beside her on the settee.
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo, it is wonderful, but to a sympathetic observer only acting,
NA
I noted that my presence reassured her, and was much comforted by this
fact.
NA
NA
NA
her as if to make sure that we were alone. â€œExcept for odd people,
friends, I suppose, of the Colonelâ€™s, we have had so few visitors since
we have been at Crayâ€™s Folly. Apart from all sorts of queer happenings
NA
whatever, the crowning mystery to my mind is why Colonel Menendez should
NA
NA
â€œScarcely at all. The â€˜Countyâ€™--do you know what I mean by the
â€˜County?â€™--began by receiving him with open arms and ended by sending
him to Coventry. His lavish style of entertainment they labelled
â€˜swankâ€™--horrible word but very expressive! They concluded that they
did not understand him, and of everything they donâ€™t understand they
disapprove. So after the first month or so it became very lonely
at Crayâ€™s Folly. Our foreign servants--there are five of them
altogether--got us a dreadfully bad name. Then, little by little, a sort
of cloud seemed to settle on everything. The Colonel made two visits
abroad, I donâ€™t know exactly where he went, but on his return from the
NA
NA
â€œI am afraid it would be hopeless to try to make you understand, Mr.
Knox, but in some subtle way she changed. Underneath all her vivacity
NA
little gesture of despair.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, not much more than a month ago. And after that, somehow or
other, matters seemed to come to a head. I confess I became horribly
frightened, but to have left would have seemed like desertion, and
NA
â€œDid you actually witness any of the episodes which took place about a
NA
Val Beverley shook her head.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI will try if you wish, for really I am longing to talk to someone
about it. For instance, on several occasions I have heard footsteps in
NA
NA
NA
NA
She nodded.
â€œThat is the uncanny part of it. You know how familiar one grows with
the footsteps of persons living in the same house? Well, these footsteps
NA
NA
â€œYes. My rooms are almost directly overhead. And right at the end of the
corridor, that is on the southeast corner of the building, is Colonel
Menendezâ€™s bedroom, and facing it a sort of little smoke-room. It was in
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
She paused, staring at me with a sort of embarrassment, and presently:
NA
NA
began to creep into her eyes again, â€œwith whose footsteps I was quite
NA
NA
NA
had been lying awake listening. I was nervous. Madame de StÃ¤mer had
told me that morning that the Colonel had seen someone lurking about
the lawns on the previous night. Then, as I lay awake listening for
the slightest sound, I suddenly detected these footsteps; and they
NA
NA
â€œFrankly, I was too frightened to do anything. I just lay still with my
heart beating horribly, and presently they passed on, and I heard them
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, I have often heard them, Mr. Knox. What makes it so strange is
that all the servants sleep out in the west wing, as you know, and Pedro
NA
NA
NA
it mean except that there is someone in Crayâ€™s Folly who is never seen
NA
NA
â€œIt is not so incredible in a big house like this. Besides, what other
NA
NA
NA
NA
Val Beverleyâ€™s expression grew troubled.
NA
â€œNone. Her attitude mystified me very much. Indeed, instead of
reassuring me, she frightened me more than ever by her very silence.
NA
NA
NA
â€œI could not tell you, Mr. Knox. You see I have always been asleep when
it has come, but I have sat up trembling and dimly aware that what had
NA
NA
â€œNone whatever. Of course, all these things may seem trivial to you, and
possibly they can be explained in quite a simple way. But this feeling
of something pending has grown almost unendurable. Then, I donâ€™t

She suddenly stopped speaking and flushed with embarrassment.
â€œIf you mean that Madame de StÃ¤mer is in love with her cousin, I agree

NA
NA
At this point our tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte was interrupted by the return of Madame de
StÃ¤mer.
NA
too animated this evening. He is threatened with one of his attacks and
I have insisted upon his immediate retirement. He makes his apologies,
NA
I expressed my concern, and:
NA
NA
NA
NA
She wheeled her chair up beside Val Beverley, and taking the girlâ€™s hand
patted it affectionately.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
 concluded Madame. â€œYes, I trust so. We want no Cuban devils here at
NA
I had hoped that she would speak further of the matter, but having thus
apologized for our hostâ€™s absence, she plunged into an amusing account
of Parisian society, and of the changes which five years of war had
brought about. Her comments, although brilliant, were superficial, the
only point I recollect being her reference to a certain Baron Bergmann,
a Swedish diplomat, who, according to Madame, had the longest nose and
the shortest memory in Paris, so that in the cold weather, â€œhe even
NA
Her brightness I thought was almost feverish. She chattered and laughed
and gesticulated, but on this occasion she was overacting. Underneath
all her vivacity lay something cold and grim.
Harley rejoined us in half an hour or so, but I could see that he was
as conscious of the air of tension as I was. All Madameâ€™s high spirits
could not enable her to conceal the fact that she was anxious to retire.
But Harleyâ€™s evident desire to do likewise surprised me very greatly;
for from the point of view of the investigation the day had been an
unsatisfactory one. I knew that there must be a hundred and one things
which my friend desired to know, questions which Madame de StÃ¤mer could
have answered. Nevertheless, at about ten oâ€™clock we separated for
the night, and although I was intensely anxious to talk to Harley, his
reticent mood had descended upon him again, and:
NA
NA
With which cryptic remark and not another word he passed on and entered
his own room.
CHAPTER XI
THE SHADOW ON THE BLIND
Perhaps it was childish on my part, but I accepted this curt dismissal
very ill-humouredly. That Harley, for some reason of his own, wished
to be alone, was evident enough, but I resented being excluded from his
confidence, even temporarily. It would seem that he had formed a theory
in the prosecution of which my coÃ¶peration was not needed. And what
with profitless conjectures concerning its nature, and memories of
Val Beverleyâ€™s pathetic parting glance as we had bade one another
good-night, sleep seemed to be out of the question, and I stood for a
long time staring out of the open window.
The weather remained almost tropically hot, and the moon floated in a
cloudless sky. I looked down upon the closely matted leaves of the box
hedge, which rose to within a few feet of my window, and to the left I
could obtain a view of the close-hemmed courtyard before the doors of
Crayâ€™s Folly. On the right the yews began, obstructing my view of the
Tudor garden, but the night air was fragrant, and the outlook one of
peace.
After a time, then, as no sound came from the adjoining room, I turned
in, and despite all things was soon fast asleep.
Almost immediately, it seemed, I was awakened. In point of fact, nearly
four hours had elapsed. A hand grasped my shoulder, and I sprang up in
bed with a stifled cry, but:
NA
NA
â€œNothing, nothing. I am sorry to have to disturb your beauty sleep, but
in the absence of Innes I am compelled to use you as a dictaphone,
Knox. I like to record impressions while they are fresh, hence my having
NA
NA
alert.

toward the table-lamp.
His figure showed as a black silhouette against the dim square of the
window.
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes. I think we might smoke, though. Have you any cigarettes? I have
NA
I managed to find my case, and in the dim light of the match which I
presently struck I saw that Paul Harleyâ€™s face was very fixed and grim.
He seated himself on the edge of my bed, and:
NA
only have I secretly had my own car sent down here, but I have had
something else sent, as well. I brought it in under my coat this
NA
NA
â€œYou remember the silken rope-ladder with bamboo rungs which I brought
NA
NA
NA
â€œBut, my dear fellow, what possible use can it be to you at Crayâ€™s
NA
NA
â€œIt enabled me to descend from my window a couple of hours ago and to
return again quite recently without disturbing the household. Donâ€™t
reproach me, Knox. I know it is a breach of confidence, but so is the
NA
NA
â€œI do. I have a reputation to lose, Knox, and if an ingenious piece of

â€œBut, my dear Harley, why should you want to leave the house secretly at

Paul Harleyâ€™s cigarette glowed in the dark, then:
NA
were really watching the place. For instance, I wanted to see if all
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
That he was about to make some strange revelation I divined. I detected
the fact, too, that he believed this revelation would be unpleasant to
me; and in this I found an explanation of his earlier behaviour. He had
seemed distraught and ill at ease when he had joined Madame de StÃ¤mer,
Miss Beverley, and myself in the drawing room. I could only suppose that
this and the abrupt parting with me outside my door had been due to
his holding a theory which he had proposed to put to the test before
confiding it to me. I remember that I spoke very slowly as I asked him
the question:
NA
â€œHas Colonel Menendez taken you into a little snuggery or smoke-room

NA
NA
NA
â€œAccording to Madame de StÃ¤mer he went to bed several hours ago, you may

NA

NA
â€œTo a very curious fact, and the fact is this: The Colonel is not

I sat bolt upright.
NA
NA
NA
â€œMy dear fellow, we must face facts. I repeat, the Colonel is not
NA
NA
NA
NA
Again Paul Harleyâ€™s cigarette glowed in the darkness.
NA
NA
NA
â€œDonâ€™t get excited, Knox. I am dealing with the strangest case of my
career, and I am jumping to no conclusions. But just let us look at
the circumstances judicially. The whole of the domestic staff we may
dismiss, with the one exception of Mrs. Fisher, who, so far as I can
make out, occupies the position of a sort of working housekeeper, and
whose rooms are in the corner of the west wing immediately facing the
kitchen garden. Possibly you have not met Mrs. Fisher, Knox, but I have
made it my business to interview the whole of the staff and I may
say that Mrs. Fisher is a short, stout old lady, a native of Kent, I
believe, whose outline in no way corresponds to that which I saw upon
the blind. Therefore, unless the door which communicates with the
servantsâ€™ quarters was unlocked again to-night--to what are we reduced
in seeking to explain the presence of a woman in Colonel Menendezâ€™s
room? Madame de StÃ¤mer, unassisted, could not possibly have mounted the
NA
NA
He ceased speaking, and I watched the steady glow of his cigarette in
the darkness. It lighted up his bronzed face and showed me the steely
gleam of his eyes.
NA
continued, speaking very deliberately. â€œHe is a man I would trust no
farther than I could see him, and if there is anything dark underlying
this matter you depend that he is involved in it. But the most natural
explanation, and also the most simple, is this--Colonel Menendez has
been taken seriously ill, and someone is in his room in the capacity of
NA
NA
Harley.
NA
â€œI am quite prepared to do so, Knox. On three occasions, then, I saw
the figure of a woman, who wore some kind of loose robe, quite clearly
silhouetted upon the linen blind. Her gestures strongly resembled those
NA
NA
â€œExactly. I gathered that she was addressing someone, presumably Colonel
Menendez, and I derived a strong impression that she was in a condition
NA
NA
in the movements, or in the outline of the figure, by which you could
NA
NA
of loose robe, possibly a kimono. Beyond that I could swear to nothing,
NA
We fell silent for a while. What Paul Harleyâ€™s thoughts may have been
I know not, but my own were strange and troubled. Presently I found my
voice again, and:
NA
NA
NA
the slightest assistance. You are no doubt wondering why I retired so
abruptly to-night. My reason was this: I could see that you were full of
some story which you had learned from Miss Beverley, and I was anxious
NA
NA
â€œNot upon any particular inmate, but I had early perceived a distinct
possibility that these manifestations of which the Colonel complained
might be due to the agency of someone inside the house. That this
person might be no more than an accomplice of the prime mover I also
NA
I repeated Val Beverleyâ€™s story of the mysterious footsteps and of the
cries which had twice awakened her in the night.
NA
NA
NA
â€œMy dear Knox, it is my business to doubt everything until I have
indisputable evidence of its truth. I say, assuming her story to be
true, we find ourselves face to face with the fantastic theory that some
NA
NA
that would account for the Colonelâ€™s marked unwillingness to talk about
NA
My sight was now becoming used to the dusk, and I saw Harley vigorously
shake his head.
NA
NA
NA
â€œObviously those of the woman who, at this present moment, so far as I
NA
I sighed wearily.
â€œThis is a strange business, Harley. I begin to think that the mystery
NA
We fell silent again. The weird cry of a night hawk came from somewhere
in the valley, but otherwise everything within and without the great
house seemed strangely still. This stillness presently imposed its
influence upon me, for when I spoke again, I spoke in a low voice.
NA
NA
NA
â€œtherefore I am in a position to inform you that you did hear the
fluttering of wings. An owl has just flown into one of the trees
NA
NA
NA
 continued Harley; â€œotherwise, when the woman whose shadow I saw upon the
blind to-night raised her arms in a peculiar fashion, I could not well
have failed to attach undue importance to the shape of the shadow thus
NA
NA
NA
He spoke the words quietly, but in that still darkness, with dawn yet a
long way off, they possessed the power which belongs to certain chords
in music, and to certain lines in poetry. I was chilled unaccountably,
and I peopled the empty corridors of Crayâ€™s Folly with I know not
what uncanny creatures; nightmare fancies conjured up from memories of
haunted manors.
Such was my mood, then, when suddenly Paul Harley stood up. My eyes were
growing more and more used to the darkness, and from something strained
in his attitude I detected the fact that he was listening intently.
He placed his cigarette on the table beside the bed and quietly crossed
the room. I knew from his silent tread that he wore shoes with rubber
soles. Very quietly he turned the handle and opened the door.
NA
Dimly I saw him raise his hand. Inch by inch he opened the door. My
nerves in a state of tension, I sat there watching him, when without
a sound he slipped out of the room and was gone. Thereupon I arose and
followed as far as the doorway.
Harley was standing immediately outside in the corridor. Seeing me, he
NA
NA
With that he moved stealthily off, and I stood there, my heart beating
with unusual rapidity, listening--listening for a challenge, a cry, a
scuffle--I knew not what to expect.
Cavernous and dimly lighted, the corridor stretched away to my left.
On the right it branched sharply in the direction of the gallery
overlooking the hall.
The seconds passed, but no sound rewarded my alert listening--until,
very faintly, but echoing in a muffled, church-like fashion around that
peculiar building, came a slight, almost sibilant sound, which I took to
be the gentle closing of a distant door.
Whilst I was still wondering if I had really heard this sound or merely
imagined it:
NA
I heard a faint click, and knew that he had shone the light of an
electric torch down into the hall.
I hesitated no longer, but ran along to join him. As I came to the head
of the main staircase, however, I saw him crossing the hall below. He
was making in the direction of the door which shut off the servantsâ€™
quarters. Here he paused, and I saw him trying the handle. Evidently
the door was locked, for he turned and swept the white ray all about the
place. He tried several other doors, but found them all to be locked,
for presently he came upstairs again, smiling grimly when he saw me
there awaiting him.
NA
NA
Paul Harley nodded.
NA
distinctly heard a stair creak. Someone crossed the hall then, Knox.
NA
His glance met and challenged mine.
NA
NA
CHAPTER XII
MORNING MISTS
The man known as Manoel awakened me in the morning. Although
characteristically Spanish, he belonged to a more sanguine type than
the butler and spoke much better English than Pedro. He placed upon the
table beside me a tray containing a small pot of China tea, an apple, a
peach, and three slices of toast.
NA
NA
NA
the ladies rarely come down. Would you prefer to breakfast in your

NA
â€œHe tells me that he does not take breakfast, sir. Colonel Don Juan
Menendez will be unable to ride with you this morning, but a groom will
accompany you to the heath if you wish, which is the best place for a
gallop. Breakfast on the south veranda is very pleasant, sir, if you are
NA
NA
NA
Having drunk a cup of tea and dressed I went into Harleyâ€™s room, to
find him propped up in bed reading the _Daily Telegraph_ and smoking a
cigarette.
NA
He fixed his pillows more comfortably, and slowly shook his head.
NA
NA
â€œI know you have weird theories on the subject, but this is a beautiful
NA
â€œI grant you the beautiful morning, Knox, but here you will find me when
NA
I knew him too well to debate the point, and accordingly I left him to
his newspaper and cigarette, and made my way downstairs. A housemaid was
busy in the hall, and in the courtyard before the monastic porch a negro
groom awaited me with two fine mounts. He touched his hat and grinned
expansively as I appeared. A spirited young chestnut was saddled for
my use, and the groom, who informed me that his name was Jim, rode a
smaller, Spanish horse, a beautiful but rather wicked-looking creature.
We proceeded down the drive. Pedro was standing at the door of the
lodge, talking to his surly-looking daughter. He saluted me very
ceremoniously as I passed.
Pursuing an easterly route for a quarter of a mile or so, we came to a
narrow lane which branched off to the left in a tremendous declivity.
Indeed it presented the appearance of the dry bed of a mountain torrent,
and in wet weather a torrent this lane became, so I was informed by
Jim. It was very rugged and dangerous, and here we dismounted, the groom
leading the horses.
Then we were upon a well-laid main road, and along this we trotted on to
a tempting stretch of heath-land. There was a heavy mist, but the
scent of the heather in the early morning was delightful, and there was
something exhilarating in the dull thud of the hoofs upon the springy
turf. The negro was a natural horseman, and he seemed to enjoy the ride
every bit as much as I did. For my own part I was sorry to return. But
the vapours of the night had been effectively cleared from my mind, and
when presently we headed again for the hills, I could think more coolly
of those problems which overnight had seemed well-nigh insoluble.
We returned by a less direct route, but only at one point was the path
so steep as that by which we had descended. This brought us out on a
road above and about a mile to the south of Crayâ€™s Folly. At one point,
through a gap in the trees, I found myself looking down at the gray
stone building in its setting of velvet lawns and gaily patterned
gardens. A faint mist hovered like smoke over the grass.
Five minutes later we passed a queer old Jacobean house, so deeply
hidden amidst trees that the early morning sun had not yet penetrated to
it, except for one upstanding gable which was bathed in golden light. I
should never have recognized the place from that aspect, but because of
its situation I knew that this must be the Guest House. It seemed very
gloomy and dark, and remembering how I was pledged to call upon Mr.
Colin Camber that day, I apprehended that my reception might be a cold
one.
Presently we left the road and cantered across the valley meadows, in
which I had walked on the previous day, reentering Crayâ€™s Folly on
the south, although we had left it on the north. We dismounted in the
stable-yard, and I noted two other saddle horses in the stalls, a pair
of very clean-looking hunters, as well as two perfectly matched ponies,
which, Jim informed me, Madame de StÃ¤mer sometimes drove in a chaise.
Feeling vastly improved by the exercise, I walked around to the veranda,
and through the drawing room to the hall. Manoel was standing there,
and:
NA
I nodded and went upstairs. It seemed to me that life at Crayâ€™s Folly
was quite agreeable, and such was my mood that the shadowy Bat Wing
menace found no place in it save as the chimera of a sick manâ€™s
imagination. One thing only troubled me: the identity of the woman who
had been with Colonel Menendez on the previous night.
However, such unconscious sun worshippers are we all that in the glory
of that summer morning I realized that life was good, and I resolutely
put behind me the dark suspicions of the night.
I looked into Harleyâ€™s room ere descending, and, as he had assured
me would be the case, there he was, propped up in bed, the _Daily
Telegraph_ upon the floor beside him and the _Times_ now open upon the
coverlet.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Manoel had removed my unopened newspapers from the bedroom, placing
them on the breakfast table on the south veranda; and I had propped the
_Mail_ up before me and had commenced to explore a juicy grapefruit
when something, perhaps a faint breath of perfume, a slight rustle of
draperies, or merely that indefinable aura which belongs to the presence
of a woman, drew my glance upward and to the left. And there was Val
Beverley smiling down at me.
NA
NA
NA
She was dressed in a simple summery frock which left her round,
sun-browned arms bare above the elbow, and she laid a huge bunch of
roses upon the table beside my tray.
NA
will delight your eyes at luncheon. Donâ€™t you think we are a lot of
NA
NA
â€œWell, if I had not taken pity upon you, here you would have bat over a
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
true hospitality. To expect oneâ€™s guests to perform their parlour tricks
around a breakfast table in the morning is, on the other hand, true
NA
NA
delightful freedom about the Colonelâ€™s way of living. Only some horrid
old Victorian prude could possibly take exception to it. Did you enjoy
NA
NA
roses in carefully blended groups.
Her fingers were very delicate and tactile, and such is the character
which resides in the human hand, that whereas the gestures of Madame de
StÃ¤mer were curiously stimulating, there was something in the movement
of Val Beverleyâ€™s pretty fingers amidst the blooms which I found most
soothing.
NA
NA
She looked at me in a startled way.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
well admit that he has always seemed a charming man to me. I have never
spoken to him, but he looks as though he could be very fascinating. Have
NA
NA
My companion shook her head.
NA
and she is one of the daintiest creatures imaginable, but I know nothing
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Again I detected the startled expression upon Val Beverleyâ€™s face.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Val Beverley shrugged her shoulders, a habit which it was easy to see
she had acquired from Madame de StÃ¤mer.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
She dismissed the subject with a light gesture and poured me out a
second cup of coffee.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
She gathered up the bunches of roses and looked down at me with a
wistful expression.
NA
NA
The look of wistfulness changed to another which I hated to see in her
eyes, an expression of repressed fear.
NA
NA
Doubt of her had been far enough from my mind, but that something in the
tone of my voice had put her on her guard I could see.
NA
NA
NA
There was a constraint in her manner which was all too obvious, and
when presently, laden with the spoil of the rose garden, she gave me a
parting smile and hurried into the house, I sat there very still for a
while, and something of the brightness had faded from the coming, nor
did life seem so glad a business as I had thought it quite recently.
CHAPTER XIII
AT THE GUEST HOUSE
I presented myself at the Guest House at half-past eleven. My mental
state was troubled and indescribably complex. Perhaps my own uneasy,
thoughts were responsible for the idea, but it seemed to me that the
atmosphere of Crayâ€™s Folly had changed yet again. Never before had
I experienced a sense of foreboding like that which had possessed me
throughout the hours of this bright summerâ€™s morning.
Colonel Menendez had appeared about nine oâ€™clock. He exhibiting no
traces of illness that were perceptible to me. But this subtle change
which I had detected, or thought I had detected, was more marked in
Madame StÃ¤mer than in any one. In her strange, still eyes I had read
what I can only describe as a stricken look. It had none of the heroic
resignation and acceptance of the inevitable which had so startled me in
the face of the Colonel on the previous day. There was a bitterness in
it, as of one who has made a great but unwilling sacrifice, and again I
had found myself questing that faint but fugitive memory, conjured up by
the eyes of Madame de StÃ¤mer.
Never had the shadow lain so darkly upon the house as it lay this
morning with the sun blazing gladly out of a serene sky. The birds, the
flowers, and Mother Earth herself bespoke the joy of summer. But beneath
the roof of Crayâ€™s Folly dwelt a spirit of unrest, of apprehension. I
thought of that queer lull which comes before a tropical storm, and I
thought I read a knowledge of pending evil even in the glances of the
servants.
I had spoken to Harley of this fear. He had smiled and nodded grimly,
saying:
â€œEvidently, Knox, you have forgotten that to-night is the night of the
NA
It was in no easy state of mind, then, that I opened the gate and walked
up to the porch of the Guest House. That the solution of the grand
mystery of Crayâ€™s Folly would automatically resolve these lesser
mysteries I felt assured, and I was supported by the idea that a clue
might lie here.
The house, which from the roadway had an air of neglect, proved on close
inspection to be well tended, but of an unprosperous aspect. The brass
knocker, door knob, and letter box were brilliantly polished, whilst
the windows and the window curtains were spotlessly clean. But the place
cried aloud for the service of the decorator, and it did not need the
deductive powers of a Paul Harley to determine that Mr. Colin Camber was
in straitened circumstances.
In response to my ringing the door was presently opened by Ah Tsong. His
yellow face exhibited no trace of emotion whatever. He merely opened the
door and stood there looking at me.
NA
NA
He proceeded quietly to close the door again.
NA
NA
Ah Tsong allowed the door to remain open, but:
NA
NA
NA
NA
 of which, fortunately, I had a smattering:
NA
NA
NA
in the porch he retired along the sparsely carpeted hall.
This hall was very gloomily lighted, but I could see several pieces of
massive old furniture and a number of bookcases, all looking incredibly
untidy.
Rather less than a minute elapsed, I suppose, when from some place at
the farther end of the hallway Mr. Camber appeared in person. He wore a
threadbare dressing gown, the silken collar and cuffs of which were very
badly frayed. His hair was dishevelled and palpably he had not shaved
this morning.
He was smoking a corncob pipe, and he slowly approached, glancing from
the card which he held in his hand in my direction, and then back again
at the card, with a curious sort of hesitancy. In spite of his untidy
appearance I could not fail to mark the dignity of his bearing, and the
almost arrogant angle at which he held his head.
NA
look in which I could detect no sign of recognition. â€œI am advised that

NA
interrupted your work, but as no other opportunity may occur of renewing

across a contribution of yours of the _Occult Review_, I have availed

His expression changed immediately and the sombre eyes lighted up.
NA
Forgive my seeming rudeness, Mr. Knox, but indeed my memory is of the

He held the door wide open, and inclined his head in a gesture of
curious old-world courtesy which was strange in so young a man. And
congratulating myself upon the happy thought which had enabled me to win
such instant favour, I presently found myself in a study which I despair
of describing.
In some respects it resembled the lumber room of an antiquary, whilst
in many particulars it corresponded to the interior of one of those
second-hand bookshops which abound in the neighbourhood of Charing Cross
Road. The shelves with which it was lined literally bulged with books,
and there were books on the floor, books on the mantelpiece, and books,
some open and some shut, some handsomely bound, and some having the
covers torn off, upon every table and nearly every chair in the place.
NA
upon a littered desk before which I presumed Mr. Camber had been seated
at the time of my arrival. Some wet vessel, probably a cup of tea or
coffee, had at some time been set down upon the page at which this
volume was open, for it was marked with a dark brown ring. A volume of
NA
the binding was burned in several places where cigarettes had been laid
upon it.
In this interesting, indeed unique apartment, East met West, unabashed
by Kiplingâ€™s dictum. Roman tear-vases and Egyptian tomb-offerings stood
upon the same shelf as empty Bass bottles; and a hideous wooden idol
from the South Sea Islands leered on eternally, unmoved by the
presence upon his distorted head of a soft felt hat made, I believe, in
Philadelphia.
Strange implements from early British barrows found themselves in the
company of _Thugee_ daggers There were carved mammalsâ€™ tusks and snake
emblems from Yucatan; against a Chinese ivory model of the Temple of Ten
Thousand Buddhas rested a Coptic crucifix made from a twig of the Holy
Rose Tree. Across an ancient Spanish coffer was thrown a Persian rug
into which had been woven the monogram of Shah-Jehan and a text from
the Koran. It was easy to see that Mr. Colin Camberâ€™s studies must have
imposed a severe strain upon his purse.

NA
He lighted his pipe and stared at me complacently.
Whilst I had greatly revised my first estimate of the man, my revisions
had been all in his favour. Respecting his genius my first impression
was confirmed. That he was ahead of his generation, perhaps a new
Galileo, I was prepared to believe. He had a pride of bearing which I
think was partly racial, but which in part, too, was the insignia of
intellectual superiority. He stood above the commonplace, caring little
for the views of those around and beneath him. From vanity he was
utterly free. His was strangely like the egotism of true genius.
NA
NA
pointed to the scarred book which I have already mentioned. â€œIt is a
work of profound scholarship. But having perused its hundreds of pages,
what has the student learned? Does he know why the twenty-sixth
chapter of the â€˜Book of the deadâ€™ was written upon lapis-lazuli, the
twenty-seventh upon green felspar, the twenty-ninth upon cornelian, and
the thirtieth upon serpentine? He does not. Having studied Part Four,
has he learned the secret of why Osiris was a black god, although he
typified the Sun? Has he learned why modern Christianity is losing its
hold upon the nations, whilst Buddhism, so called, counts its disciples
by millions? He has not. This is because the scholar is rarely the

NA

NA
tantamount to stating that I belong to the greatest community of traders
which has appeared since the Phoenicians overran the then known world.
America has not produced the mystic, yet JudÃ¦a produced the founder of
Christianity, and Gautama Buddha, born of a royal line, established
the creed of human equity. In what way did these magicians, for a
miracle-worker is nothing but a magician, differ from ordinary men? In
one respect only: They had learned to control that force which we have

As he spoke those words Colin Camber directed upon me a glance from
his luminous eyes which frankly thrilled me. The bemused figure of the
Lavender Arms was forgotten. I perceived before me a man of power, a man
of extraordinary knowledge and intellectual daring. His voice, which was
very beautiful, together with his glance, held me enthralled.

power, all light comes from one source. That source is the sun! The sun

for a child to be born in that cavern, do you know what that child would

I shook my head slowly. Whereupon, laying his corn-cob upon the desk,
Colin Camber burst into a fit of boyish laughter, which seemed to
rejuvenate him again, which wiped out the image of the magus completely,
and only left before me a very human student of strange subjects, and
withal a fascinating companion.

This abrupt question rather startled me, but:
NA
NA
NA
NA
Standing up, he crossed to a cabinet littered untidily with all sorts
of strange-looking objects, carved bones, queer little inlaid boxes,
images, untidy manuscripts, and what-not.
He took up what looked like a very ungainly tobacco-pipe, made of some
rich brown wood, and, handing it to me:
NA
again to his face.
I did as he requested and made no discovery of note. The thing clearly
was not intended for a pipe. The stem was soiled and, moreover, there
was carving inside the bowl. So that presently I returned it to him,
shaking my head.
â€œUnless one should be informed of the properties of this little

NA
He struck the hollow of the bowl upon the palm of his hand, and it
delivered a high, bell-like note which lingered curiously. Then:
NA
He made a short striking motion with the thing, similar to that which
one would employ who had designed to jerk something out of the bowl.
And at the very spot on the floor where any object contained in the bowl
would have fallen, came a reprise of the bell note! Clearly, from almost
at my feet, it sounded, a high, metallic ring.
He struck upward, and the bell-note sounded on the ceiling; to the
right, and it came from the window; in my direction, and the tiny bell
seemed to ring beside my ear! I will honestly admit that I was startled,
but:
NA
discovered by conventional Western science. It was known to the Egyptian
priesthood, of course; hence the Vocal Memnon. It was known to Madame

He returned the little instrument to its place upon the cabinet.

employment of darkness against light--is to be met with in Haiti and

He nodded, replacing his pipe between his teeth.

I was watching him closely as he spoke, and a shadow, a strange shadow,
crept over his face, a look almost of exaltation--of mingled sorrow and
gladness which I find myself quite unable to describe.

I did not understand his question, and was still wondering about it when
I heard a gentle knock, the door opened, and a woman came in.
CHAPTER XIV
YSOLA CAMBER
I find it difficult, now, to recapture my first impression of that
meeting. About the woman, hesitating before me, there was something
unexpected, something wholly unfamiliar. She belonged to a type with
which I was not acquainted. Nor was it wonderful that she should strike
me in this fashion, since my wanderings, although fairly extensive,
had never included the West Indies, nor had I been to Spain; and this
girl--I could have sworn that she was under twenty--was one of those
rare beauties, a golden Spaniard.
That she was not purely Spanish I learned later.
She was small, and girlishly slight, with slender ankles and exquisite
little feet; indeed I think she had the tiniest feet of any woman I
had ever met. She wore a sort of white pinafore over her dress, and her
arms, which were bare because of the short sleeves of her frock, were of
a child-like roundness, whilst her creamy skin was touched with a faint
tinge of bronze, as though, I remember thinking, it had absorbed
and retained something of the Southern sunshine. She had the swaying
carriage which usually belongs to a tall woman, and her head and neck
were Grecian in poise.
Her hair, which was of a curious dull gold colour, presented a mass of
thick, tight curls, and her beauty was of that unusual character which
makes a Cleopatra a subject of deathless debate. What I mean to say is
this: whilst no man could have denied, for instance, that Val Beverley
was a charmingly pretty woman, nine critics out of ten must have failed
to classify this golden Spaniard correctly or justly. Her complexion was
peach-like in the Oriental sense, that strange hint of gold underlying
the delicate skin, and her dark blue eyes were shaded by really
wonderful silken lashes.
Emotion had the effect of enlarging the pupils, a phenomenon rarely met
with, so that now as she entered the room and found a stranger present
they seemed to be rather black than blue.
Her embarrassment was acute, and I think she would have retired without
speaking, but:
NA
compounded of sorrow and pride, â€œallow me to present Mr. Malcolm Knox,

He turned to me.

NA
Perhaps I had expected this, indeed, subconsciously, I think I had.

As Mrs. Camber extended her hand with a sort of appealing timidity, it
appeared to me that she felt herself to be intruding. The expression
in her beautiful eyes when she glanced at her husband could only be
described as one of adoration; and whilst it was impossible to doubt
his love for her, I wondered if his colossal egotism were capable of
stooping to affection. I wondered if he knew how to tend and protect
this delicate Southern girl wife of his.
Remembering the episode of the Lavender Arms, I felt justified in
doubting her happiness, and in this I saw an explanation of the mingled
sorrow and pride with which Colin Camber regarded her. It might betoken
recognition of his own shortcomings as a husband.
NA
She spoke in a faintly husky manner which was curiously attractive,
although lacking the deep, vibrant tones of Madame de StÃ¤merâ€™s memorable
voice. Her English was imperfect, but her accent good.

us, Ysola, I shall beg Mr. Knox, in honour of this occasion, to drink a

I watched him as he spoke, a lean, unkempt figure invested with a
curious dignity, and I found it almost impossible to believe that this
was the same man who had sat in the bar of the Lavender Arms, sipping
whisky and water. The resemblance to the portrait in Harleyâ€™s office
became more marked than ever. There was an air of high breeding about
the delicate features which, curiously enough, was accentuated by the
unshaven chin. I recognized that refusal would be regarded as a rebuff,
and therefore:
NA
Colin Camber inclined his head gravely and courteously.
NA
He clapped his hands, and, silent as a shadow, Ah Tsong appeared. I
noted that although it was Camber who had summoned him, it was to Mrs.
Camber that the Chinaman turned for orders. I had thought his yellow
face incapable of expression, but as his oblique eyes turned in the
direction of the girl I read in them a sort of dumb worship, such as one
sees in the eyes of a dog.
She spoke to him rapidly in Chinese.
NA
I saw that Colin Camber had detected my interest, for:
NA
NA
NA
four feet from the floor and laughed gleefully. â€œCan you imagine what a
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Mrs. Camber having seated herself upon one of the few chairs which was
not piled with books, her husband had resumed his place by the writing
desk, and I sought in vain to interpret the glances which passed between
them.
The fact that these two were lovers none could have mistaken. But here
again, as at Crayâ€™s Folly, I detected a shadow. I felt that something
had struck at the very root of their happiness, in fact, I wondered if
they had been parted, and were but newly reunited for there was a sort
of constraint between them, the more marked on the womanâ€™s side than on
the manâ€™s. I wondered how long they had been married, but felt that it
would have been indiscreet to ask.
Even as the idea occurred to me, however, an opportunity arose of
learning what I wished to know. I heard a bell ring, and:
NA
NA
Without another word he stood up and walked out of the room.
NA
servant, except Ah Tsong, her name is Mrs. Powis. She is visiting her
NA
â€œIt is difficult to imagine you burdened with household
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
I gazed at her in amazement.
NA
NA
NA
with sparkling eyes, â€œhow funny. Sometimes I wish I looked older. It is
dreadful in this place, although we have been so happy here. At all the
NA
NA
NA
She slightly shook her head, and I saw the pupils begin to dilate.
NA
NA
She nodded.
NA
She nodded again, watching me intently.
NA
NA
Colinâ€™s people are so proud, so proud. Do you know what they are like,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Her eyes grew misty, and she quickly lowered her lashes.
NA
NA
NA
She shook her golden head as if to dismiss the subject, and stood up, as
Camber entered, followed by Ah Tsong bearing a tray of refreshments.
Of the ensuing conversation I remember nothing. My mind was focussed
upon the one vital fact that Mrs. Camber was a Cuban Creole. Dimly I
felt that here was the missing link for which Paul Harley was groping.
For it was in Cuba that Colin Camber had met his wife, it was from Cuba
that the menace of Bat Wing came.
What could it mean? Surely it was more than a coincidence that these
two families, both associated with the West Indies, should reside within
sight of one another in the Surrey Hills. Yet, if it were the result of
design, the design must be on the part of Colonel Menendez, since the
Cambers had occupied the Guest House before he had leased Crayâ€™s Folly.
I know not if I betrayed my absentmindedness during the time that I was
struggling vainly with these maddening problems, but presently, Mrs.
Camber having departed about her household duties, I found myself
walking down the garden with her husband.
NA
and I regret to state that I retained no impression of his having
previously mentioned the subject. â€œDuring the time that Sir James
Appleton resided at Crayâ€™s Folly, I worked here regularly in the summer
months. It was Sir James, of course, who laid out the greater part of
the gardens and who rescued the property from the state of decay into
NA
I aroused myself from the profitless reverie in which I had become lost.
We were standing before a sort of arbour which marked the end of the
grounds of the Guest House. It overhung the edge of a miniature ravine,
in which, over a pebbly course, a little stream pursued its way down the
valley to feed the lake in the grounds of Crayâ€™s Folly.
From this point of vantage I could see the greater part of Colonel
Menendezâ€™s residence. I had an unobstructed view of the tower and of the
Tudor garden.

He sighed, and turning abruptly, led the way back to the house, holding
himself very erect, and presenting a queer figure in his threadbare
dressing gown.
It was now a perfect summerâ€™s day, and I commented upon the beauty of
the old garden, which in places was bordered by a crumbling wall.
NA
of the name of the house, that it might have been part of a monastery
or convent. This was not the case, however. It derives its name from a
certain Sir Jaspar Guest, who flourished, I believe, under King Charles

NA

NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI am leaving as soon as I can find another residence, suited both to my
requirements and to my slender purse. But these domestic affairs can be
of no possible interest to you. I take it, Mr. Knox, that you will grant
NA
NA
As I spoke the words I had moved a little ahead at a point where
the path was overgrown by a rose bush, for the garden was somewhat
neglected.
NA
Never can I forget the spectacle which I beheld.
Colin Camberâ€™s peculiarly pale complexion had assumed a truly ghastly
pallor, and he stood with tightly clenched hands, glaring at me almost
insanely.
NA
He moistened his dry lips, and:
NA
difficulty.
NA
NA
He clutched the collar of his pyjama jacket and wrenched so strongly
that the button was torn off. His passion was incredible, insane. The
power of speech had almost left him.
NA
speaking of the name seemed almost to choke him. â€œOf--Devil Menendez.
You--you--are a spy. You have stolen my hospitality--you have obtained
NA
NA
my fists, for the manâ€™s language was grossly insulting, â€œyou forget
NA
NA
quivering forefinger--â€œgo! If you have any spark of compassion in your
NA
Nostrils dilated, he stood with that quivering finger outstretched, and
now having become as speechless as he, I turned and walked rapidly up to
the house.
NA
NA
As I walked in past the study door the Chinaman came to meet me, holding
my hat and cane. I took them from him without a word, and, the door
being held open by Ah Tsong, walked out on to the road.
My heart was beating rapidly. I did not know what to think nor what to
do. This ignominious dismissal afforded an experience new to me. I was
humiliated, mortified, but above all, wildly angry.
How far I had gone on my homeward journey I cannot say, when the sound
of quickly pattering footsteps intruded upon my wild reverie. I stopped,
turned, and there was Ah Tsong almost at my heels.
NA
I hesitated, glaring at him in a way that must have been very
unpleasant; but recovering myself I tore open the envelope, and read the
following note, written in pencil and very shakily:
MR. KNOX. Please forgive him. If you knew what we have suffered from
Senor Don Juan Menendez, I know you would forgive him. Please, for my
sake. YSOLA CAMBER.
The Chinaman was watching me, that strangely pathetic expression in his
eyes, and:
NA
said.
NA
Ah Tsong turned, and ran swiftly off, as I pursued my way back to Crayâ€™s
Folly in a mood which I shall not attempt to describe.
CHAPTER XV
UNREST
I sat in Paul Harleyâ€™s room. Luncheon was over, and although, as on the
previous day, it had been a perfect repast, perfectly served, the sense
of tension which I had experienced throughout the meal had made me
horribly ill at ease.
That shadow of which I have spoken elsewhere seemed to have become
almost palpable. In vain I had ascribed it to a morbid imagination:
persistently it lingered.
Madame de StÃ¤merâ€™s gaiety rang more false than ever. She twirled the
rings upon her slender fingers and shot little enquiring glances all
around the table. This spirit of unrest, from wherever it arose, had
communicated itself to everybody. Madameâ€™s several bon mots one and all
were failures. She delivered them without conviction like an amateur
repeating lines learned by heart. The Colonel was unusually silent,
eating little but drinking much. There was something unreal, almost
ghastly, about the whole affair; and when at last Madame de StÃ¤mer
retired, bearing Val Beverley with her, I felt certain that the Colonel
would make some communication to us. If ever knowledge of portentous
evil were written upon a manâ€™s face it was written upon his, as he sat
there at the head of the table, staring straightly before him. However:
NA
shall I say, a tangible character, at least I feel sure that you must

Harley stared at him sternly.

â€œI will speak plainly. I mean that you know more about the nature of
this danger than you have ever communicated to me. Allow me to proceed,
if you please, Colonel Menendez. For your delightful hospitality I thank
you. As your guest I could be happy, but as a professional investigator
whose services have been called upon under most unusual circumstances, I

Their glances met. Both were angry, wilful, and self-confident.
Following a few moments of silence:

protruding. He was fighting an inward battle; then:

NA
Paul Harley stood up.
NA
said, coldly.
The Colonel rose also, and:

done so, I beg of you to remain at least another night, can you refuse

Harley stood at the end of the table watching him.
NA
handicap rests on the fact that I do not know against whom I am pitted.
NA
â€œI thank you, Mr. Harley. As I fear I am far from well, dare I hope to
NA
Harley and I bowed, and the Colonel, returning our salutations, walked
slowly out, his bearing one of grace and dignity. So that memorable
luncheon terminated, and now we found ourselves alone and faced with
a problem which, from whatever point one viewed it, offered no single
opening whereby one might hope to penetrate to the truth.
Paul Harley was pacing up and down the room in a state of such nervous
irritability as I never remembered to have witnessed in him before.
I had just finished an account of my visit to the Guest House and of the
indignity which had been put upon me, and:
NA
is like the quest of heaven, Knox. A hundred open doors invite us,
each one promising to lead to the light, and if we enter where do they
lead?--to mystification. For instance, Colonel Menendez has broadly
hinted that he looks upon Colin Camber as an enemy. Judging from your
reception at the Guest House to-day, such an enmity, and a deadly
enmity, actually exists. But whereas Camber has resided here for
three years, the Colonel is a newcomer. We are, therefore, offered
the spectacle of a trembling victim seeking the sacrifice. Bah! it is
NA
â€œIf you had seen Colin Camberâ€™s face to-day, you might not have thought
NA
â€œBut I should, Knox! I should! It is impossible to suppose that Colonel
Menendez was unaware when he leased Crayâ€™s Folly that Camber occupied

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
bitterly. â€œThat great man, preserving his philosophical calm, doubtless
by this time would have pieced together these disjointed clues, and
have produced an elegant pattern ready to be framed and exhibited to the

He dropped down upon the bed, and taking his briar from his pocket,
began to load it in a manner which was almost vicious. I stood watching
him and offered no remark, until, having lighted the pipe, he began to

NA
we bristle when someone tries to prove that we are not infallible! How

I sighed with relief, for Harley at these times imposed a severe strain
even upon my easy-going disposition.
NA
hundred up. I have arrived at a point where my ideas persistently work
NA
The billiard room was immediately beneath us, adjoining the last
apartment in the east wing, and there we made our way. Harley
played keenly, deliberately, concentrating upon the game. I was less
successful, for I found myself alternately glancing toward the door
and the open window, in the hope that Val Beverley would join us. I was
disappointed, however. We saw no more of the ladies until tea-time, and
if a spirit of constraint had prevailed throughout luncheon, a veritable
demon of unrest presided upon the terrace during tea.
Madame de StÃ¤mer made apologies on behalf of the Colonel. He was
prolonging his siesta, but he hoped to join us at dinner.
NA
Madame de StÃ¤mer shrugged her shoulders and shook her head, blankly.
NA
NA
Harley nodded sympathetically, but I could see that he was not
satisfied. Yet, although he might doubt her explanation, he had noted,
and so had I, that Madame de StÃ¤merâ€™s concern was very real. Her slender
hands were strangely unsteady; indeed her condition bordered on one of
distraction.
Harley concealed his thoughts, whatever they may have been, beneath that
mask of reserve which I knew so well, whilst I endeavoured in vain to
draw Val Beverley into conversation with me.
I gathered that Madame de StÃ¤mer had been to visit the invalid, and
that she was all anxiety to return was a fact she was wholly unable to
conceal. There was a tired look in her still eyes, as though she had
undertaken a task beyond her powers to perform, and, so unnatural a
quartette were we, that when presently she withdrew I was glad, although
she took Val Beverley with her.
Paul Harley resumed his seat, staring at me with unseeing eyes. A
sound reached us through the drawing room which told us that Madame de
StÃ¤merâ€™s chair was being taken upstairs, a task always performed when
Madame desired to visit the upper floors by Manoel and Pedroâ€™s daughter,
Nita, who acted as Madameâ€™s maid. These sounds died away, and I thought
how silent everything had become. Even the birds were still, and
presently, my eye being attracted to a black speck in the sky above, I
learned why the feathered choir was mute. A hawk was hovering loftily
overhead.
Noting my upward glance, Paul Harley also raised his eyes.

CHAPTER XVI
RED EVE
Over the remainder of that afternoon I will pass in silence. Indeed,
looking backward now, I cannot recollect that it afforded one incident
worthy of record. But because great things overshadow small, so it may
be that whereas my recollections of quite trivial episodes are sharp
enough up to a point, my memories from this point onward to the horrible
and tragic happening which I have set myself to relate are hazy and
indistinct. I was troubled by the continued absence of Val Beverley.
I thought that she was avoiding me by design, and in Harleyâ€™s gloomy
reticence I could find no shadow of comfort.
We wandered aimlessly about the grounds, Harley staring up in a vague
fashion at the windows of Crayâ€™s Folly; and presently, when I stopped to
inspect a very perfect rose bush, he left me without a word, and I found
myself alone.
Later, as I sauntered toward the Tudor garden, where I had hoped to
encounter Miss Beverley, I heard the clicking of billiard balls; and
there was Harley at the table, practising fancy shots.
He glanced up at me as I paused by the open window, stopped to relight
his pipe, and then bent over the table again.
NA
Understanding his moods as well as I did, I merely laughed and withdrew.
I strolled around into the library and inspected scores of books without
forming any definite impression of the contents of any of them. Manoel
came in whilst I was there and I was strongly tempted to send a message
to Miss Beverley, but common sense overcame the inclination.
When at last my watch told me that the hour for dressing was arrived,
I heaved a sigh of relief. I cannot say that I was bored, my ill-temper
sprang from a deeper source than this. The mysterious disappearance of
the inmates of Crayâ€™s Folly, and a sort of brooding stillness which lay
over the great house, had utterly oppressed me.
As I passed along the terrace I paused to admire the spectacle afforded
by the setting sun. The horizon was on fire from north to south and the
countryside was stained with that mystic radiance which is sometimes
called the Blood of Apollo. Turning, I saw the disk of the moon coldly
rising in the heavens. I thought of the silent birds and the hovering
hawk, and I began my preparations for dinner mechanically, dressing as
an automaton might dress.
Paul Harleyâ€™s personality was never more marked than in his evil moods.
His power to fascinate was only equalled by his power to repel. Thus,
although there was a light in his room and I could hear Lim moving
about, I did not join him when I had finished dressing, but lighting a
cigarette walked downstairs.
The beauty of the night called to me, although as I stepped out upon the
terrace I realized with a sort of shock that the gathering dusk held a
menace, so that I found myself questioning the shadows and doubting
the rustle of every leaf. Something invisible, intangible yet potent,
brooded over Crayâ€™s Folly. I began to think more kindly of the
disappearance of Val Beverley during the afternoon. Doubtless she, too,
had been touched by this spirit of unrest and in solitude had sought to
dispel it.
So thinking. I walked on in the direction of the Tudor garden. The place
was bathed in a sort of purple half-light, lending it a fairy air of
unreality, as though banished sun and rising moon yet disputed for
mastery over earth. This idea set me thinking of Colin Camber, of
Osiris, whom he had described as a black god, and of Isis, whose silver
disk now held undisputed sovereignty of the evening sky.
Resentment of the treatment which I had received at the Guest House
still burned hotly within me, but the mystery of it all had taken the
keen edge off my wrath, and I think a sort of melancholy was the keynote
of my reflections as, descending the steps to the sunken garden, I saw
Val Beverley, in a delicate blue gown, coming toward me. She was the
spirit of my dreams, and the embodiment of my mood. When she lowered her
eyes at my approach, I knew by virtue of a sort of inspiration that she
had been avoiding me.
NA
NA
NA
I paced slowly along beside her.
NA
She glanced up swiftly, and as swiftly lowered her lashes again.
NA
NA
NA
â€œI think I do. Your womanâ€™s intuition has told you that there is
NA
NA
â€œYou are afraid of your thoughts. You can see that Madame de StÃ¤mer and
Colonel Menendez are deliberately concealing something from Paul Harley,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
with such a dreadful foreboding, yet I donâ€™t know how to explain it to
NA
NA
NA
just morbid imagination on my part. If only I knew what to do, what to
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œShe came to my room and sobbed hysterically for nearly an hour this
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œIt may be so, Mr. Knox, but in that event why have they not sent for a
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œNever. It is utterly unaccountable. Certainly during the last few
months he has given up riding practically altogether, and in other ways
has changed his former habits, but I have never known him to exhibit
NA
NA
â€œNot that I know of. Oh, there is something uncanny about it all.
NA
She had spoken on impulse, and seeing her swift embarrassment:
NA
NA
Truth to tell my heart was beating rapidly, and, so selfish is the
nature of man, I was more glad to learn that my company was acceptable
to Val Beverley than I should have been to have had the riddle of Crayâ€™s
Folly laid bare before me.
Those sweetly indiscreet words, however, had raised a momentary barrier
between us, and we walked on silently to the house, and entered the
brightly lighted hall.
The silver peal of a Chinese tubular gong rang out just when we reached
the veranda, and as Val Beverley and I walked in from the garden, Madame
de StÃ¤mer came wheeling through the doorway, closely followed by Paul
Harley. In her the art of the toilette amounted almost to genius, and
she had so successfully concealed all traces of her recent grief that I
wondered if this could have been real.
NA
for other people. The Colonel is truly desolate, but he cannot join us
NA
Harley inclined his head sympathetically, and assisted to arrange Madame
in her place.
NA
 he said, glancing across to me. â€œIt would seem that troubles never come
NA
NA
bare, â€œthey come in flocks, or not at all. But I suppose we should feel
NA
I loved her unquenchable spirit, and I have wondered often enough what
I should have thought of her if I had known the truth. France has bred
some wonderful women, both good and bad, but none I think more wonderful
than Marie de StÃ¤mer.
If such a thing were possible, we dined more extravagantly than on
the previous night. Madameâ€™s wit was at its keenest; she was truly
brilliant. Pedro, from the big bouffet at the end of the room,
supervised this feast of Lucullus, and except for odd moments of silence
in which Madame seemed to be listening for some distant sound, there was
nothing, I think, which could have told a casual observer that a black
cloud rested upon the house.
Once, interrupting a tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte between Val Beverley and Paul Harley:
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou know you are, my dear, and you are very wise. Flirt all your
life, but never fall in love. It is fatal, donâ€™t you think so, Mr.
NA
I looked into her still eyes, which concealed so much.
NA
â€œYes, that is more pretty, but not so true. If I could live my life
NA
sometimes the English mode of address, â€œI should build a stone wall
NA
Oddly enough, then, as it seems to me now, the spirit of unrest seemed
almost to depart for awhile, and in the company of the vivacious
Frenchwoman time passed very quickly up to the moment when Harley and I
walked slowly upstairs to join the Colonel.
During the latter part of dinner an idea had presented itself to me
which I was anxious to mention to Harley, and:
NA
NA
NA
NA
Paul Harley paused on the stairs, turning to me.
â€œYou are thinking that he has taken cover from the danger which he
NA
NA
NA
He led the way to a little smoke-room which hitherto I had never
visited, and in response to his knock:
NA
We entered to find ourselves in a small and very cosy room. There was a
handsome oak bureau against one wall, which was littered with papers
of various kinds, and there was also a large bookcase occupied almost
exclusively by French novels. It occurred to me that the Colonel spent a
greater part of his time in this little snuggery than in the more formal
study below. At the moment of our arrival he was stretched upon a
settee near which stood a little table; and on this table I observed the
remains of what appeared to me to have been a fairly substantial repast.
For some reason which I did not pause to analyze at the moment I noted
with disfavour the presence of a bowl of roses upon the silver tray.
Colonel Menendez was smoking a cigarette, and Manoel was in the act of
removing the tray.
NA
my sorrow. Manoel, pull up those armchairs. Help yourself to port, Mr.
Harley, and fill Mr. Knoxâ€™s glass. I can recommend the cigars in the

As we seated ourselves:
NA
He was watching the dark face keenly, and probably thinking, as I was
thinking, that it exhibited no trace of illness.
Colonel Menendez waved his cigarette gracefully, settling himself amid
the cushions.
NA
NA
NA
Colonel Menendez shrugged slightly.
NA
replied. â€œBesides, there is nothing for it but rest and avoidance of
NA
NA
long. Indeed, I should not have consented to disturb you at all, if
I had not thought that you might have some request to make upon this
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYour interest comforts me very greatly, gentlemen, and I am only
sorry that my uncertain health has made me so poor a host. Nothing
has occurred since your arrival to help you, I am aware. Not that I
am anxious for any new activity on the part of my enemies. But almost
NA
He spoke the final words with a peculiar intonation. I saw Harley
watching him closely.
NA
if your visit should prove futile, I can only apologize for
NA
NA
NA
to indicate that the danger which you apprehend may really culminate
NA
NA
NA
NA
Colonel Menendez inclined his head gravely.
NA
On the whole, he was curiously subdued. He was most solicitous for our
comfort and his exquisite courtesy had never been more marked. I often
think of him now--his big but graceful figure reclining upon the settee,
whilst he skilfully rolled his eternal cigarettes and chatted in that
peculiar, light voice. Before the memory of Colonel Don Juan Sarmiento
Menendez I sometimes stand appalled. If his Maker had but endowed him
with other qualities of mind and heart equal to his magnificent courage,
then truly he had been a great man.
CHAPTER XVII
NIGHT OF THE FULL MOON
I stood at Harleyâ€™s open window--looking down in the Tudor garden. The
moon, like a silver mirror, hung in a cloudless sky. Over an hour had
elapsed since I had heard Pedro making his nightly rounds. Nothing
whatever of an unusual nature had occurred, and although Harley and I
had listened for any sound of nocturnal footsteps, our vigilance had
passed unrewarded. Harley, unrolling the Chinese ladder, had set out
upon a secret tour of the grounds, warning me that it must be a long
business, since the brilliance of the moonlight rendered it necessary
that he should make a wide detour, in order to avoid possible
observation from the windows. I had wished to join him, but:
NA
 he had replied.
As a result, here was I at the open window, questioning the shadows to
right and left of me, and every moment expecting to see Harley reappear.
I wondered what discoveries he would make. It would not have surprised
me to learn that there were lights in many windows of Crayâ€™s Folly
to-night.
Although, when we had rejoined the ladies for half an hour, after
leaving Colonel Menendezâ€™s room, there had been no overt reference to
the menace overhanging the house, yet, as we separated for the night, I
had detected again in Val Beverleyâ€™s eyes that look of repressed fear.
Indeed, she was palpably disinclined to retire, but was carried off by
the masterful Madame, who declared that she looked tired.
I wondered now, as I gazed down into the moon-bathed gardens, if Harley
and I were the only wakeful members of the household at that hour. I
should have been prepared to wager that there were others. I thought of
the strange footsteps which so often passed Miss Beverleyâ€™s room, and I
discovered this thought to be an uncomfortable one.
Normally, I was sceptical enough, but on this night of the full moon
as I stood there at the window, the horrors which Colonel Menendez
had related to us grew very real in my eyes, and I thought that the
mysteries of Voodoo might conceal strange and ghastly truths, â€œThe
NA
leapt unbidden to my mind; and, such is the magic of moonlight, they
became invested with a new and a deeper significance. Strange, that
theories which one rejects whilst the sun is shining should assume a
spectral shape in the light of the moon.
Such were my musings, when suddenly I heard a faint sound as of
footsteps crunching upon gravel. I leaned farther out of the window,
listening intently. I could not believe that Harley would be guilty of
such an indiscretion as this, yet who else could be walking upon the
path below?
As I watched, craning from the window, a tall figure appeared, and,
slowly crossing the gravel path, descended the moss-grown steps to the
Tudor garden.
It was Colonel Menendez!
He was bare-headed, but fully dressed as I had seen him in the
smoking-room; and not yet grasping the portent of his appearance at that
hour, but merely wondering why he had not yet retired, I continued to
watch him. As I did so, something in his gait, something unnatural in
his movements, caught hold of my mind with a sudden great conviction. He
had reached the path which led to the sun-dial, and with short, queer,
ataxic steps was proceeding in its direction, a striking figure in the
brilliant moonlight which touched his gray hair with a silvery sheen.
His unnatural, automatic movements told their own story. He was walking
in his sleep! Could it be in obedience to the call of Mâ€™kombo?
My throat grew dry and I knew not how to act. Unwillingly it seemed,
with ever-halting steps, the figure moved onward. I could see that his
fists were tightly clenched and that he held his head rigidly upright.
All horrors, real and imaginary, which I had ever experienced,
culminated in the moment when I saw this man of inflexible character,
I could have sworn of indomitable will, moving like a puppet under the
influence of some unnameable force.
He was almost come to the sun-dial when I determined to cry out. Then,
remembering the shock experienced by a suddenly awakened somnambulist,
and remembering that the Chinese ladder hung from the window at my feet,
I changed my mind. Checking the cry upon my lips, I got astride of the
window ledge, and began to grope for the bamboo rungs beneath me. I had
found the first of these, and, turning, had begun to descend, when:
NA
NA
It was Paul Harley returned from his tour of the building.
NA
NA
NA
NA
Harley, and with that he ran off in the same direction.
Disentangling my foot from the rungs of the ladder which lay upon
the ground, I was about to follow, when it happened--that strange and
ghastly thing toward which, secretly, darkly, events had been tending.
The crack of a rifle sounded sharply in the stillness, echoing and
re-echoing from wing to wing of Crayâ€™s Folly and then, more dimly, up
the wooded slopes beyond! Somewhere ahead of me I heard Harley cry out:
NA
Then, hotfoot, I was making for the entrance to the garden. Just as I
came to it and raced down the steps I heard another sound the memory of
which haunts me to this day.
Where it came from I had no idea. Perhaps I was too confused to judge
accurately. It might have come from the house, or from the slopes beyond
the house, But it was a sort of shrill, choking laugh, and it set the
ultimate touch of horror upon a _scÃ¨ne macabre_ which, even as I write
of it, seems unreal to me.
I ran up the path to where Harley was kneeling beside the sun-dial.
Analysis of my emotions at this moment were futile; I can only say that
I had come to a state of stupefaction. Face downward on the grass, arms
outstretched and fists clenched, lay Colonel Menendez. I think I saw him
move convulsively, but as I gained his side Harley looked up at me, and
beneath the tan which he never lost his face had grown pale. He spoke
through clenched teeth.
NA
One glance I gave at the ghastly wound in the base of the Colonelâ€™s
skull, and then swayed backward in a sort of nausea. To see a man die
in the heat of battle, a man one has known and called friend, is strange
and terrible. Here in this moon-bathed Tudor garden it was a horror
almost beyond my powers to endure.
Paul Harley, without touching the prone figure, stood up. Indeed no
examination of the victim was necessary. A rifle bullet had pierced his
brain, and he lay there dead with his head toward the hills.
I clutched at Harleyâ€™s shoulder, but he stood rigidly, staring up the
slope past the angle of the tower, to where a gable of the Guest House
jutted out from the trees.
NA
NA
A moment longer he stood fixedly watching, and then:
NA
NA
He spoke in a stern and unnatural voice.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
He had somewhat relaxed, but now as I continued to clutch his arm, I
felt the muscles grow rigid again.
NA
I followed the direction of his fixed stare, and through the trees on
the hillside a dim light shone out. Someone had lighted a lamp in the
Guest House.
A faint, sibilant sound drew my glance upward, and there overhead a
bat circled--circled--dipped--and flew off toward the distant woods. So
still was the night that I could distinguish the babble of the little
stream which ran down into the lake. Then, suddenly, came a loud
flapping of wings. The swans had been awakened by the sound of the shot.
Others had been awakened, too, for now distant voices became audible,
and then a muffled scream from somewhere within Crayâ€™s Folly.
NA
the women away. Get Pedro, and send Manoel for the nearest doctor.
Itâ€™s useless but usual. Let no one deface his footprints. My worst
NA
Throughout the time that he spoke he continued to search the moon-bathed
landscape with feverish eagerness, but except for a faint movement
of birds in the trees, for they, like the swans on the lake, had been
alarmed by the shot, nothing stirred.
NA
And even as I started on my unpleasant errand, he had set out running
toward the gate in the southern corner of the garden.
For my part I scrambled unceremoniously up the bank, and emerged where
the yews stood sentinel beside the path. I ran through the gap in the
box hedge just as the main doors were thrown open by Pedro.
He started back as he saw me.
NA
â€œYes, yes! there is terrible trouble, sir. What has happened? What has
NA
NA
NA
Pedro uttered some exclamation in Spanish and stood, pale-faced, swaying
before me, a dishevelled figure in a dressing gown. And now in the
background Mrs. Fisher appeared. One frightened glance she cast in my
direction, and would have hurried across the hall but I intercepted her.
NA
NA
NA
communicated with Madame de StÃ¤merâ€™s bedchamber.
I heard a frightened cry proceeding from that direction, and recognized
the voice of Nita, the girl who acted as Madameâ€™s maid. Then I heard Val
Beverley.
â€œGo and fetch Mrs. Fisher, Nita, at once--and try to behave yourself. I
NA
I entered the corridor and pulled up short. Val Beverley, fully dressed,
was kneeling beside Madame de StÃ¤mer, who wore a kimono over her
night-robe, and who lay huddled on the floor immediately outside the
door of her room!
NA
NA
Nita, the Spanish girl, who was sobbing hysterically, ran along to join
Mrs. Fisher.
NA
always is, by the need of others. â€œBut first tell me--how did Madame de
NA
â€œI donâ€™t know, I donâ€™t know! I was startled by the shot. It has awakened
everybody. And just as I opened my door to listen, I heard Madame cry
out in the hall below. I ran down, turned on the light, and found her
lying here. She, too, had been awakened, I suppose, and was endeavouring
to drag herself from her room when her strength failed her and she
NA
â€œand Pedro is out of his senses, and Nita, who was the first of the

I nodded reassuringly, and stooping, lifted the swooning woman. She was
much heavier than I should have supposed, but, Val Beverley leading the
way, I carried her into her apartment and placed her upon the bed.
NA
NA
NA
She laid her hands upon my shoulders appealingly, and looked up into my
eyes in a way that made me long to take her in my arms and comfort her,
an insane longing which I only crushed with difficulty.
NA
Fisher had just entered.
NA
I nodded.
NA
Val Beverley opened and closed her eyes, clutching at me dizzily for a
moment, then:
NA
NA
I made her sit down in an armchair, and watched her anxiously, but
although every speck of colour had faded from her cheeks, she was
splendidly courageous, and almost immediately she smiled up at me, very
wanly, but confidently.
NA
NA
When I returned to the hall I found it already filled with a number of
servants incongruously attired. Carter the chauffeur, who lived at the
lodge, was just coming in at the door, and:
NA
If there is another man who can drive, send him for the police. Your

CHAPTER XVIII
INSPECTOR AYLESBURY OF MARKET HILTON
NA
Dawn was creeping grayly over the hills, and the view from the library
windows resembled a study by Bastien-Lepage. The lamps burned yellowly,
and the exotic appointments of the library viewed in that cold light for
some reason reminded me of a stage set seen in daylight. The Velasquez
portrait mentally translated me to the billiard room where something lay
upon the settee with a white sheet drawn over it; and I wondered if
my own face looked as wan and comfortless as did the faces of my
companions, that is, of two of them, for I must except Inspector
Aylesbury.
Squarely before the oaken mantel he stood, a large, pompous man, but in
this hour I could find no humour in Paul Harleyâ€™s description of him as
resembling a walrus. He had a large auburn moustache tinged with
gray, and prominent brown eyes, but the lower part of his face, which
terminated in a big double chin, was ill-balanced by his small forehead.
He was bulkily built, and I had conceived an unreasonable distaste for
his puffy hands. His official air and oratorical manner were provoking.
Harley sat in the chair which he had occupied during our last interview
with Colonel Menendez in the library, and I had realized--a realization
which had made me uncomfortable--that I was seated upon the couch
on which the Colonel had reclined. Only one other was present, Dr.
Rolleston of Mid-Hatton, a slight, fair man with a brisk, military
manner, acquired perhaps during six years of war service. He was
standing beside me smoking a cigarette.
â€œI have taken all the necessary particulars concerning the position of
NA
of pockets, etc., and I now turn to you, Mr. Harley, as the first person
NA
Paul Harley lay back in the armchair watching the speaker.
â€œBefore we come to what happened here to-night I should like to be quite
NA
Aylesbury raised one finger in forensic manner--â€œnow, you visited me
yesterday afternoon, Mr. Harley, and asked for certain information
NA
NA
NA
and impressively, â€œdid I know of any negro or coloured people living
in, or about, Mid-Hatton, and could I give you a list of the residents
within a two-mile radius of Crayâ€™s Folly. I gave you the information
which you required, and now it is your turn to give me some. Why did you
NA
NA
Menendez to visit Crayâ€™s Folly, accompanied by my friend, Mr. Knox, in
order that I might investigate certain occurrences which had taken place
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œPossibly not, but someone broke in, nevertheless. Secondly, Colonel
Menendez had detected someone lurking about the lawns, and thirdly, the
NA
Inspector Aylesbury lowered his eyebrows and concentrated a frowning
glance upon the speaker.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The Inspector cleared his throat.
â€œSomeone broke into Crayâ€™s Folly, then, a fact which was not reported to
me, a suspicious loiterer was seen in the grounds, again not reported,
and someone played a silly practical joke by nailing the wing of a bat,
you say, to the door. Might I ask, Mr. Harley, why you mention this
matter? The other things are serious, but why you should mention the
NA
NA
appreciate the fact. But, you see, Colonel Menendez regarded it as the
NA
NA
â€œThe bat wing, decidedly. He believed it to be the token of a negro
secret society which had determined upon his death, hence my enquiries
regarding coloured men in the neighbourhood. Do you understand,
NA
Inspector Aylesbury took a large handkerchief from his pocket and blew
his nose. Replacing the handkerchief he cleared his throat, and:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Paul Harley glanced across in my direction and smiled grimly.
NA
NA
Inspector.
NA
NA
Inspector Aylesbury stared at him dully.
NA
NA
â€œVery well, then. The late Colonel Menendez thought he was in danger
NA
NA
â€œand he was under the impression that he had offended a powerful native
society, and that for many years their vengeance had pursued him.
Attempts to assassinate him had already taken place in Cuba and in the
NA
NA
â€œHe was shot at, several times, and once, in Washington, was attacked by
a man with a knife. He maintained in my presence and in the presence
of my friend, Mr. Knox, here, that these various attempts were due to
NA
NA
â€œVoodoo, Inspector, also known as Obeah, a cult which has spread from
the West Coast of Africa throughout the West Indies and to parts of the

Inspector Aylesbury scratched his chin.
NA
that people called Voodoos wanted to kill him? Before we go any farther,
NA
â€œTwenty years ago in the West Indies he had shot an important member of

NA
NA
â€œI see. Then for twenty years these Voodoos have been trying to kill
him? Then he comes and settles here in Surrey and someone nails a bat
NA
NA
NA
NA
Paul Harley nodded grimly.
â€œWhy did he go to you in preference to the local police, the proper
NA
â€œHe was advised to do so by the Spanish ambassador, or so he informed
NA
â€œIs that so? Well, I suppose it had to be. Coming from foreign parts. I
NA
â€œVery well, I understand now what you were doing here, Mr. Harley. The
next thing is, what were you doing tonight, as I see that both you and
NA
NA
Inspector Aylesbury turned to me ponderously, raising a fat hand.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œMore or less we were here for that purpose. You see, on the night
of the full moon, according to Colonel Menendez, Obeah people become

NA

Inspector Aylesbury cleared his throat again and looked frowningly
across at my friend.
NA
demanded.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou see, Inspector, I regarded it as my duty to patrol the grounds of
the house at nightfall, since, for all I knew to the contrary, some of
the servants might be responsible for the attempts of which the Colonel
complained. I had descended from the window of my room, had passed
entirely around the house east to west, and had returned to my
starting-point when Mr. Knox, who was looking out of the window,
NA
NA
â€œNot from my position below, but being informed by my friend, who
was hurriedly descending the ladder, that the Colonel had entered the
NA
NA
â€œHe had acquired a habit of walking in his sleep, and I presumed that he

â€œOh, I see. So being told by the gentleman at the window that Colonel
Menendez was in the garden, you started to run toward him. While you
NA
NA
NA
â€œNothing is more difficult to judge, Inspector, especially when one is
NA
NA
frowning at Harley, â€œyou cannot tell me that you formed no impression on

NA
NA
NA
â€œWithin a hundred yards, and you have no idea from which direction the

NA
NA
â€œI ran on and down into the sunken garden. I saw Colonel Menendez lying
upon his face near the sun-dial. He was moving convulsively. Running up
NA
NA
NA
NA
Paul Harley looked at him quietly.
NA
Inspector Aylesbury cleared his throat again, and:
â€œI donâ€™t think I should have let my man slip through my fingers like

NA
â€œYou were actually on the spot when the shot was fired, you admit that
it was fired within a hundred yards, yet you did nothing to apprehend

amateur, Inspector. For my future guidance I should be glad to know what
NA
Inspector Aylesbury blew his nose.
NA
a different tale to tell. But he was a foreigner, and he paid for his

Paul Harley took out his pipe and began to load it in a deliberate and
lazy manner.
Inspector Aylesbury turned his prominent eyes in my direction.

COMPLICATIONS
NA

happenings, Dr. Rolleston had made his report, and Inspector Aylesbury
was now examining the servants in the library. Harley and I had obtained
his official permission to withdraw, and the physician was visiting
Madame de StÃ¤mer, who lay in a state of utter prostration.
NA
â€œI mean that he will presently make some tragic blunder. Good God,
Knox, to think that this man had sought my aid, and that I stood by idly

banged the table with his fist. â€œEven now that these unknown fiends have
achieved their object, I am helpless, helpless. There was not a wisp of

trees, with a house that might have been built for a sounding-board, who
could presume to say where either came from? One thing we know, that the

Harley glanced in the direction of the open door.

Inspector Wessex down from Scotland Yard, I foresee a miscarriage of
justice. Colonel Menendez lay on his face, and the line made by his

probably this horrible deed was done on the spur of the moment. It is

I have personally interviewed these people. But of course if our
blundering friend directly questions me, I shall have no alternative. I
shall have to answer him. His talent for examination, however, scarcely
amounts to genius, so that we may not be called upon for further details
at the moment. I wonder how I can induce him to requisition Scotland

He rested his chin in his hand and stared down reflectively at the
carpet. I thought that he looked very haggard, as he sat there in the
early morning light, dressed as for dinner. There was something pathetic
in the pose of his bowed head.

NA
I turned aside as the door opened and Dr. Rolleston came in.
NA
NA
NA
Dr. Rolleston lighted a cigarette, frowning perplexedly the while.
NA
He walked across to the fireplace and dropped the match, staring at
Harley with a curious expression.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI am certain of it. She must have had knowledge of a danger to be
apprehended, and being awakened by the sound of the rifle shot, have
realized by a sort of intuition that the expected tragedy had happened.
I should say, from the presence of a small bruise which I found upon her
NA
NA
NA
sometimes find that a second shock counteracts the effect of the first.
This, temporarily at any rate, seems to have happened to-night. She
is now in a very curious state: a form of hysteria, no doubt, but very

NA
Dr. Rolleston nodded affirmatively.
â€œYes, a very capable nurse. I am glad to know that Madame de StÃ¤mer is
in such good hands. I am calling again early in the morning, and I have
told Mrs. Fisher to see that nothing is said within hearing of the room
which could enable Madame de StÃ¤mer to obtain confirmation of the idea,

seems to be unaware of the presence of everyone except Miss Beverley.

Inspector Aylesbury scratched his chin.

He turned toward us, doubtingly, whereupon Harley stood up, yawning.

fact that both Mr. Knox and myself are extremely tired, and have passed

Harley paused, his hand on the door knob, and turned.
NA
lowering his chin so that it almost disappeared into the folds of his
neck, â€œI have now interviewed all the inmates of Crayâ€™s Folly except the
ladies. It appears to me that four people had not gone to bed. There are
you two gentlemen, who have explained why I found you in evening dress,
NA
He paused, looking from Harley to myself.
It had come, the question which I had dreaded, the question which I had
been asking myself ever since I had seen Val Beverley kneeling in the
corridor, dressed as she had been when we had parted for the night.
NA
lady had evidently not retired, and neither, it would appear, had the
NA
NA
NA
explanation is a possible one. But if the party broke up, as you say it
did, somewhere about half-past ten oâ€™clock, and if Madame de StÃ¤mer

annoy you? If they annoy you, sir, perhaps you can explain this point

â€œI cannot explain it, but doubtless Miss Beverley can do so when you ask

 â€œI mean that those of us who were aware of the previous attempts on
the life of the Colonel apprehended this danger. And I believe that

 â€œOh, to the servants? Now, I have seen all the servants, except the

Harley walked out of the dining room and across the deserted hall. He
slowly mounted the stairs and I followed him into his room. It was now
quite light, and as my friend dropped down upon the bed I thought that
he looked very tired and haggard.

I closed the door and turned to him.

â€œI heard it, and I am wondering what her answer will be when the

â€œWhen the rifle cracked out, Knox, she knew! Remember, no one had told

â€œWell, what investigator whose skull contained anything more useful than
bubbles would have failed to ask if Colonel Menendez had an enemy in the

He stared at me in a curiously significant manner.

NA

Menendez, at the moment when the bullet entered his brain, must have
been standing facing directly toward the Guest House. Now, you have seen

â€œHe was shot squarely between the eyes. A piece of wonderful

He paused, as if waiting for some comment, and:
NA
â€œObviously it came from above, Knox. Keep these two points in your mind,
and then consider the fact that someone lighted a lamp in the Guest
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhen you went off to summon assistance I ran across the lawn, scrambled
through the bushes, and succeeded in climbing down into the little gully
in which the stream runs, and up on the other side. I had proceeded
practically in a straight line from the sun-dial, and do you know where
NA
NA
â€œOf course you can. You have visited the place. I came out immediately
beside a little hut, Knox, which stands at the end of the garden of
the Guest House. Ahead of me, visible through a tangle of bushes in the
neglected garden, a lamp was burning. I crept cautiously forward,
and presently obtained a view of the interior of a kitchen. Just as
I arrived at this point of vantage the lamp was extinguished, but not
before I had had a glimpse of the only occupant of the room--the man who
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI donâ€™t know what to think, Knox. A possible explanation is that the
household had been aroused by the sound of the shot, and that Ah Tsong
had been directed to go out and see if he could learn what had happened.
At any rate, I waited no longer, but returned by the same route. If our
portly friend from Market Hilton had possessed the eyes of an Auguste
Dupin, he could not have failed to note that my dress boots were caked
NA
He stooped and examined the garments as he spoke.
NA
NA
He sighed wearily, and stared out of the window in the direction of
the Tudor garden. There was a slight chilliness in the air, which, or
perhaps a sudden memory of that which lay in the billiard room beneath
us, may have accounted for the fact that I shivered violently.
Harley glanced up with a rather sad smile.

CHAPTER XX
A SPANISH CIGARETTE
Sleep was not for me, despite Harleyâ€™s injunction, and although I was
early afoot, the big house was already astir with significant movements
which set the imagination on fire, to conjure up again the moonlight
scene in the garden, making mock of the song of the birds and of the
glory of the morning.
Manoel replied to my ring, and prepared my bath, but it was easy to see
that he had not slept.
No sound came from Harleyâ€™s room, therefore I did not disturb him, but
proceeded downstairs in the hope of finding Miss Beverley about. Pedro
was in the hall, talking to Mrs. Fisher, and:
NA
â€œNo, sir, but he will be returning at about half-past eight, so he
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œShe didnâ€™t go to her room until after four oâ€™clock, sir, but Nita tells
NA
NA
into the courtyard.
I dreaded all the ghastly official formalities which the day would
bring, since I realized that the brunt of the trouble must fall upon the
shoulders of Miss Beverley in the absence of Madame de StÃ¤mer.
I wandered about restlessly, awaiting the girlâ€™s appearance. A little
two seater was drawn up in the courtyard, but I had not paid much
attention to it, until, wandering through the opening in the box hedge
and on along the gravel path, I saw unfamiliar figures moving in the
billiard room, and turned, hastily retracing my steps. Officialdom was
at work already, and I knew that there would be no rest for any of us
from that hour onward.
As I reÃ«ntered the hall I saw Val Beverley coming down the staircase.
She looked pale, but seemed to be in better spirits than I could have
hoped for, although there were dark shadows under her eyes.
NA
NA
NA
explained.
She looked at me pathetically.
NA
â€œHe will. We had great difficulty in persuading him not to demand your
NA
NA
NA
â€œWe realized this, Miss Beverley, but you will have to face the ordeal
NA
We walked through into the library, where a maid white-faced and
frightened looking, was dusting in a desultory fashion. She went out as
we entered, and Val Beverley stood looking from the open window out into
the rose garden bathed in the morning sunlight.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The girl shook her head.
NA
NA
She hesitated.
NA
â€œShe knows! Oh, Mr. Knox! to me that is the most horrible thing of all:
that she knows, that she must have known all along--that the mere sound
NA
NA
â€œYes, yes. This was the meaning of the sorrow which I had seen so often
in her eyes, the meaning of so much that puzzled me in her words, the
explanation of lots of little things which have made me wonder in the
NA
I was silent for a while, then:
NA
NA
NA
â€œBut can you think of any reason why she should not have confided in
NA
NA
NA
NA
some vow of silence. Oh! it sounds ridiculous, wildly ridiculous, but
NA
â€œWhat other, indeed? And now, Miss Beverley, I know one of the questions
NA
NA
â€œHe has learned, from one of the servants I presume, as he did not see
NA
NA
NA
â€œI have never been so frightened in all my life as I was last night.
Sleep was utterly out of the question. There was mystery in the very
air. I knew, oh, Mr. Knox, in some way I knew that a tragedy was going
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œOh, I was going to say a strange thing that suddenly occurred to me,
but it is utterly foolish, I suppose. Inspector Aylesbury is coming back
NA
NA
â€œI am afraid I have very little to tell him. I was sitting in my room
in an appalling state of nerves when the shot was fired. I was not even
NA
NA
NA
feeling too frightened to venture farther in the darkness, I heard
NA
NA
NA
â€œShe cried out something in French. The intonation told me that it was
French, although I could not detect a single word. Then I thought I
NA
NA
â€œYes. I summoned up enough courage to turn on the light in the corridor
and to run down to the hall. And there she was lying just outside the
NA
NA
â€œYes. I turned on the light and succeeded in partly raising her, but
she was too heavy for me to lift. I was still trying to revive her when
NA
NA
I took her hand and pressed it reassuringly.
NA
NA
She smiled, and flushed slightly, as I released her hand again.
NA
NA
We turned and walked slowly back to the hall, and there just entering
from the courtyard was Inspector Aylesbury.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
followed her back into the library.
I walked out to the courtyard, and avoiding the Tudor garden and the
billiard room, turned in the other direction, passing the stables where
Jim, the negro groom, saluted me very sadly, and proceeded round to the
south side of the house.
Inspector Aylesbury, I perceived, had wasted no time. I counted no
fewer than four men, two of them in uniform, searching the lawns and the
slopes beyond, although what they were looking for I could not imagine.
Giving the library a wide berth, I walked along the second terrace,
and presently came in sight of the east wing and the tower. There,
apparently engaged in studying the rhododendrons, I saw Paul Harley.
He signalled to me, and, crossing the lawn, I joined him where he stood.
Without any word of greeting:
NA
a rapidly working brain, â€œthis is the path which the Colonel must have
followed last night. Yonder is the door by which, according to his own
account, he came out on a previous occasion, walking in his sleep. Do
NA
NA
â€œWell, Pedro found it unlocked this morning. You see it faces
practically due south, and the Colonelâ€™s bedroom is immediately above us
NA
last night only a few moments before the Colonel came out, for I was
just crossing the courtyard and could see you at my window at the moment
when you saw poor Menendez enter the Tudor garden. He must have actually
been walking around the east wing at the same time that I was walking
around the west. Now, I am going to show you something, Knox, something
NA
From his waistcoat pocket he took out a half-smoked cigarette. I stared
at it uncomprehendingly.
NA
a week now, and it may have lain there for a long time, but to me, Knox,
NA
NA
â€œThe point is that it is a hand-made cigarette, one of the Colonelâ€™s.
NA
NA
He returned it to his pocket without another word.
NA
NA
NA
â€œPrecisely. We are going to anticipate the probable movements of our
blundering Aylesbury. In short, I wish you to present me to Mr. Colin
NA
NA
NA
NA
And thereupon, to my amazement, he set off through the rhododendron
bushes in the direction of the tower!
Utterly unable to grasp the meaning of his behaviour, I followed,
nevertheless, and as we rounded the corner of the tower Harley pulled up
short, and:
NA
being seen by that constable who is prowling about at the bottom of the
lawn making signals in the direction of the library. Presumably he is
replying to Inspector Aylesbury who wants to talk to us. I am determined
to interview Camber before submitting to further official interrogation.
It must be a cross-country journey, Knox. I am afraid we shall be a
very muddy pair, but great issues may hang upon the success of our

He set off briskly toward a belt of shrubbery which marked the edge of
the little stream. Appreciating something of his intentions, I followed
his lead unquestioningly; and, scrambling through the bushes:
NA
NA
He dropped into the brook, waded across, and began to climb up the
opposite bank. I imitated his movements, and presently, having scrambled
up on the farther side, we found ourselves standing on a narrow bank
immediately under that summer house which Colin Camber had told me he
had formerly used as a study.
NA
Harley; â€œtherefore we must try to find a way round to the front. There
NA
I had now entered with zest into the business, and so the pair of us
waded through rank grass which in places was waist high, and on through
a perfect wilderness of weeds in which nettles dominated. Presently we
came to a dry ditch, which we negotiated successfully, to find ourselves
upon the high road some hundred yards to the west of the Guest House.
NA
and surveying my friend, who was a mockery of his ordinarily spruce
self.
NA
NA
We proceeded along the dusty high road, almost overarched by trees.
NA
NA
Harley stopped short, staring at me sternly.
NA
NA
NA
â€œI mean that when we are both compelled to tell all we know, I doubt if
there is a counsel in the land who would undertake the defence of Mr.
NA
NA
NA
saying so, Knox; but I do say that it will be a giantâ€™s task to prove

NA
NA
Mr. Colin Camber. I will answer your question at the conclusion of the

CHAPTER XXI
THE WING OF A BAT
For a long time our knocking and ringing elicited no response. The
brilliant state of the door-brass afforded evidence of the fact that Ah
Tsong had arisen, even if the other members of the household were still
sleeping, and Harley, growing irritable, executed a loud tattoo upon the
knocker. This had its effect. The door opened and Ah Tsong looked out.
â€œTell your master that Mr. Paul Harley has called to see him upon urgent
NA
NA
Paul Harley thrust his hand against it and addressed the man rapidly
in Chinese. I could not have supposed the face of Ah Tsong capable of
expressing so much animation. At the sound of his native tongue his eyes
lighted up, and:
NA
Although he had studiously avoided looking at me, that Ah Tsong would
inform his master of the identity of his second visitor I did not doubt.
If I had doubted I should promptly have been disillusioned, for:
NA
NA
The Chinaman, on retiring, had left the door wide open, and I could see
right to the end of the gloomy hall. Ah Tsong presently re-appeared,
shuffling along in our direction. Unemotionally:
NA
Paul Harley stamped his foot irritably.
NA
NA
Again he addressed Ah Tsong in Chinese, and although the manâ€™s wrinkled
ivory face exhibited no trace of emotion, a deep understanding was to
be read in those oblique eyes; and a second time Ah Tsong turned and
trotted back to the study. I could hear a muttered colloquy in progress,
and suddenly the gaunt figure of Colin Camber burst into view.
He was shaved this morning, but arrayed as I had last seen him. Whilst
he was not in that state of incoherent anger which I remembered and
still resented, he was nevertheless in an evil temper.
He strode along the hallway, his large eyes widely opened, and fixing a
cold stare upon the face of Harley.
NA
my presence, â€œand you send me a very strange message. I am used to the
ways of SeÃ±or Menendez, therefore your message does not deceive me. The
NA
Harley clenched his teeth, then:
NA
NA
of the treatment which I had received at his hands, I could only admire
the lofty disdain of his manner.
NA
NA
Harleyâ€™s keen eyes were searching the pale face of the man before him.
NA
Not a muscle of Colin Camberâ€™s face moved, but slowly he looked Paul
Harley up and down, then:
NA
scarcely be accused of leaping to a conclusion when I say that I believe
NA
He stepped back, and would have closed the door, but:
NA
Colin Camber paused.
NA
NA
At that Colin Camber started forward.
NA
But as if he had not heard him Harley continued:
â€œAs a matter of fact, I am a criminal investigator, and Mr. Knox is
NA
Colin Camber clenched his hands and seemed to be fighting with some
emotion which possessed him, then:
NA
NA
NA
Colin Camber stood aside, holding the door open, and inclining his head
in that grave salutation which I knew, but on this occasion, I think,
principally with intent to hide his emotion.
Not another word did he speak until the three of us stood in the strange
study where East grimaced at West, and emblems of remote devil-worship
jostled the cross of the Holy Rose. The place was laden with tobacco
smoke, and scattered on the carpet about the feet of the writing table
lay twenty or more pages of closely written manuscript. Although this
was a brilliant summerâ€™s morning, an old-fashioned reading lamp, called,
I believe, a Victoria, having a nickel receptacle for oil at one side of
the standard and a burner with a green glass shade upon the other, still
shed its light upon the desk. It was only reasonable to suppose that
Colin Camber had been at work all night.
He placed chairs for us, clearing them of the open volumes which they
bore, and, seating himself at the desk:
NA
of something when you last visited my house, something of which I would

â€œOnly a matter of the utmost urgency could have induced me to cross

He rested his long white hands upon the desk, looking across at me.

He paused for a moment.
NA
NA
Colin Camber looked very hard at the speaker, and then equally hard at
me.
â€œWas it at behest of Colonel Menendez that you called upon me, Mr.
NA
NA
NA
Colin Camber held up his hand, interrupting him.
NA
NA
He stepped forward in my direction.
â€œMr. Knox, I have grossly insulted you. Yet if you knew what had
inspired my behaviour I believe you could find it in your heart to
forgive me. I do not ask you to do so, however; I accept the humiliation
NA
He bowed to me formally, and would have returned to his seat, but:
NA
so impressive was the manâ€™s strange personality that I felt rather as
one receiving a royal pardon than as an offended party being offered an

His eyes gleamed, and he seized my hand in a warm grip.
NA
inclined his head in Paul Harleyâ€™s direction, and resumed his seat.
Harley had suffered this odd little interlude in silence but now:

newspaper upon which rested a dwindling mound of shag. â€œThis is most
disturbing, of course. But since I have not rendered myself amenable to
the law, it leaves me moderately unmoved. Upon your second point, Mr.
Harley, I shall beg you, to enlarge. You tell me that Don Juan Menendez
NA
He had begun to fill his corn-cob as he spoke the words, but from where
I sat I could just see his face, so that although his voice was well
controlled, the gleam in his eyes was unmistakable.
NA
NA
Colin Camber dropped the corn-cob and stood up again, the light of a
dawning comprehension in his eyes.
NA
NA
NA
â€œThat is why we are here, Mr. Camber, and that is why the police will be
NA
Colin Camber stood erect, one hand resting upon the desk.
NA
said, slowly.
Crossing the room, he closed and locked the study door, then, returning,
he sat down once more, entirely, master of himself. Frowning slightly he
looked from Harley in my direction, and then back again at Harley.
NA
Preposterous though I know it to be, nevertheless it is perhaps no more
NA
He was evidently thinking rapidly. His manner had grown quite cool, and
I could see that he had focussed his keen brain upon the abyss which he
perceived to lie in his path.
â€œBefore I commit myself to any statements which might be used as
NA
exact standpoint in this matter. Do you represent the late Colonel
Menendez, do you represent the law, or may I regard you as a perfectly
NA
â€œYou may regard me, Mr. Camber, as one to whom nothing but the truth is
of the slightest interest. I was requested by the late Colonel Menendez
NA
NA
â€œTo endeavour to trace the origin of certain occurrences which had led

Harley paused, staring hard at Colin Camber.
NA
 said the latter, â€œit is perhaps unfair to request you to acquaint me

NA

NA
NA
NA
The effect of those words was curious. If any doubt respecting Camberâ€™s
innocence had remained with me at this time I think his expression as he
leaned forward across the desk must certainly have removed it. That the
man was intellectually unusual, and intensely difficult to understand,
must have been apparent to the most superficial observer, but I found it
hard to believe that these moods of his were simulated. At the words â€œA
NA
his eyes. Personal danger was forgotten. Harley had trenched upon his
particular territory, and I knew that if Colin Camber had actually
killed Colonel Menendez, then it had been the act of a maniac. No man
newly come from so bloody a deed could have acted as Camber acted now.
NA
Yet again he arose, and crossing to one of the many cabinets which were
in the room, he pulled open a drawer and took out a shallow tray.
My friend was watching him intently, and from the expression upon his
bronzed face I could deduce the fact that in Colin Camber he had met
the supreme puzzle of his career. As Camber stood there, holding up an
object which he had taken from the tray, whilst Paul Harley sat staring
at him, I thought the scene was one transcending the grotesque. Here was
the suspected man triumphantly producing evidence to hang himself.
Between his finger and thumb Camber held the wing of a bat!

He returned the tray to the drawer, closed the latter, and, standing
erect, raised clenched hands above his head.
NA
NA
He reseated himself, whilst Harley regarded him silently, then:
NA
NA
NA
NA
Paul Harley nodded.
NA
â€œI understand. I must therefore take no more excursions into my special
subject, but must endeavour to regard the matter from the point of view
of the enquiry. Am I to assume that Menendez was acquainted with the

â€œAh, the black-hearted devil! But I fear I am involving myself more
deeply in suspicion. Perhaps, Mr. Harley, the ends of justice would be
better served if you were to question me, and I to confine myself to

â€œI was in the midst of a most important passage, and I should probably
have taken no steps in the matter but that Ah Tsong knocked upon the
study door, to inform me that my wife had been awakened by the sound of
the shot. She is somewhat nervous and had rung for Ah Tsong, asking him

â€œDo I understand that she imagined the sound to have come from this

We were silent for a while, until:

â€œFairly loud. And very startling, of course, in the silence of the

Paul Harley stared at him in a way which told me that he was comparing
his features line for line with the etching of Edgar Allen Poe which
hung in his office in Chancery Lane, and:
NA
NA
NA
Juan Menendez was shot in the grounds of Crayâ€™s Folly, and not
within the house, to propose to you that unless the real assassin be

NA
NA
NA
â€œThen if it would interest you, Mr. Harley, I will briefly outline the
case against myself. I had never troubled to disguise the fact that I
hated Menendez. Many witnesses can be called to testify to this. He was
in Cuba when I was in Cuba, and evidence is doubtless obtainable to show
that we stayed at the same hotels in various cities of the United States
prior to my coming to England and leasing the Guest House. Finally, he

He carefully lighted his pipe, whilst Harley and I watched him silently,
then:
NA
continued. â€œHe believed himself to be in danger, and associated this
sign with the source of his danger. Excepting himself and possibly
certain other members of his household it is improbable that any one
else in Surrey understands the significance of the token save myself.
The unholy rites of Voodoo are a closed book to the Western nations.
I have opened that book, Mr. Harley. The powers of the Obeah man, and
especially of the arch-magician known and dreaded by every negro as â€˜Bat
Wing,â€™ are familiar to me. Since I was alone at the time that the shot
was fired, and for some few minutes afterward, and since the Tudor
garden of Crayâ€™s Folly is within easy range of the Guest House, to fail

He spoke the words with a sort of triumph. Like the fakir, he possessed
the art of spiritual detachment, which is an attribute of genius. From
an intellectual eminence he was surveying his own peril. Colin Camber
in the flesh had ceased to exist; he was merely a pawn in a fascinating
game.
Paul Harley glanced at his watch.

Paul Harley nodded.

deed. I would remind you that chronic alcoholism is a recognized form,

His mood changed again, and sighing wearily, he lay back in the chair.
Over his pale face crept an expression which I knew, instinctively, to
mean that he was thinking of his wife.
NA
accentuate the beauty of his voice, â€œI have suffered much in the quest
of truth. Suffering is the gate beyond which we find compassion. Perhaps
you have thought my foregoing remarks frivolous, in view of the fact
that last night a soul was sent to its reckoning almost at my doors.
I revere the truth, however, above all lesser laws and above all
expediency. I do not, and I cannot, regret the end of the man Menendez.
But for three reasons I should regret to pay the penalty of a crime

I watched and listened, almost awed by the strangeness of the man who
sat before me. His three reasons were illuminating. A casual observer
might have regarded Colin Camber as a monument of selfishness. But it
was evident to me, and I knew it must be evident to Paul Harley, that
his egotism was quite selfless. To a natural human resentment and a
pathetic love for his wife he had added, as an equal clause, the claim
of the world upon his genius.
NA
NA
NA
â€œYou have referred to your recent lapse from abstemiousness. Excuse me
if I discuss personal matters. This you ascribed to domestic troubles,
or so Mr. Knox has informed me. You have also referred to your
undisguised hatred of the late Colonel Juan Menendez. I am going to ask
you, Mr. Camber, to tell me quite frankly what was the nature of those
domestic troubles, and what had caused this hatred which survives even

Colin Camber stood up, angular, untidy, but a figure of great dignity.

Paul Harley inclined his head gravely.

I heard a car pulled up in the road outside the Guest House. Colin

CHAPTER XXIII
INSPECTOR AYLESBURY CROSS-EXAMINES
NA
He sank his chin into its enveloping folds, treating Harley and myself
each to a stare of disapproval.
â€œThese gentlemen very kindly called to advise me of the tragic

NA

He turned to Paul Harley.
NA
â€œI am naturally interested in anything appertaining to the death of a

â€œOh, so you slip in ahead of me, having deliberately withheld

The inspector turned rapidly, confronting me. â€œI have already warned
your friend. But if I have any interruptions from you, I will have you

He continued to glare at me for some moments, and then, turning again to
Colin Camber:
â€œI say, I have information that Colonel Menendez looked upon you as a

NA
NA
â€œOh, I see. Thatâ€™s your attitude, is it? Very well, then. Were you, or

NA

â€œI say I was. I hated him, and I hate him no less in death than I hated
NA
I think that I had never seen a man so taken aback, Inspector
Aylesbury, drawing out a large handkerchief blew his nose. Replacing the
handkerchief, he produced a note-book.
NA
He made an entry in the book, and then:
NA
NA
NA
Colin Camber merely shrugged his shoulders.
NA
NA
NA
â€œOh, I see. You decline to answer that question. Very well, I will make
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Very succinctly Colin Camber repeated the statement which he had already
made to Paul Harley, and, at its conclusion:
NA
Colin Camber inclined his head, clapped his bands, and silently Ah Tsong
entered.
The Inspector stared at him for several moments as a visitor to the Zoo
might stare at some rare animal; then:
NA
NA
â€œI am going to ask you to give an exact account of your movements last
NA
NA
Inspector Aylesbury cleared his throat.
NA
Ah Tsengâ€™s face remained quite expressionless, and:

â€œHe understood my first question. You canâ€™t draw wool over my eyes. He

the Chinaman.
NA
NA
Paul Harley was leisurely filling his pipe, and:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œYour beliefs do not concern me, Inspector; I am merely offering my
NA
NA
NA
NA
Colin Camber bent his head gravely, and gave an order to Ah Tsong, who
turned and went out.
NA
NA
NA
NA
As he spoke, Colin Camber opened a drawer in his desk and took out a
heavy revolver of the American Army Service pattern.
NA
Camber passed it to the Inspector, and the latter, having satisfied
himself that none of the chambers were loaded, peered down the barrel,
and smelled at the weapon suspiciously.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The door opened and Mrs. Camber came in. She was very simply dressed,
and looked even more child-like than she had seemed before. I think
Ah Tsong had warned her of the nature of the ordeal which she was to
expect, but her wide-eyed timidity was nevertheless pathetic to witness.
She glanced at me with a ghost of a smile, and:
NA
gesture of courtesy, â€œMr. Knox has generously forgiven me a breach of
good manners for which I shall never forgive myself. I beg you to thank
NA
NA
NA
NA
Ysola, is Inspector Aylesbury, who desires a few momentsâ€™ conversation
NA
NA
The pupils of her eyes dilated, as she fixed an appealing glance upon
the Inspector.
In justice to the latter he was palpably abashed by the delicate
beauty of the girl who stood before him, by her naivete, and by that
childishness of appearance and manner which must have awakened the
latent chivalry in almost any manâ€™s heart.
â€œI am sorry to have to trouble you with this disagreeable business, Mrs.

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI really could not say, but I think that it was farther away than

â€œNo, I donâ€™t think he was. He had quickly put on an overcoat. He usually

â€œWell, I was frightened, you understand, and I told him to find out if

â€œOh, and now perhaps _you_ will tell me, Mrs. Camber, when and where
NA
Every vestige of colour fled from the girlâ€™s face.
NA
NA
NA
I think that hitherto she had not fully realized the nature of the
situation; but now something in the Inspectorâ€™s voice, or perhaps in
our glances, told her the truth. She moved to where Colin Camber was
sitting, looking down at him questioningly, pitifully. He put his arm
about her and drew her close.
Inspector Aylesbury cleared his throat and returned his note-book to his
pocket.
NA
My respect for him increased slightly, and Harley and I followed him out
of the study. A police sergeant was sitting in the hall, and Ah Tsong
was standing just outside the door.
NA
Ah Tsong stared stupidly, whereupon Paul Harley addressed him in his
native language, rapidly and in a low voice, in order, as I divined,
that the Inspector should not hear him.
NA
â€œFor any Englishman, fictitious characters excepted, to possess a
NA
Presently, then, I found myself once more in that unkempt garden of
which I retained such unpleasant memories.
Inspector Aylesbury stared all about and up at the back of the house,
humming to himself and generally behaving as though he were alone.
Before the little summer study he stood still, and:
NA
What he had seen was painfully evident. The right-hand window, beneath
which there was a permanent wooden seat, commanded an unobstructed view
of the Tudor garden in the grounds of Crayâ€™s Folly. Clearly I could
detect the speck of high-light upon the top of the sun-dial.
The Inspector stepped into the hut. It contained a bookshelf upon which
a number of books remained, a table and a chair, with some few other
dilapidated appointments. I glanced at Harley and saw that he was
staring as if hypnotized at the prospect in the valley below. I observed
a constable on duty at the top of the steps which led down into the
Tudor garden, but I could see nothing to account for Harleyâ€™s fixed
regard, until:
NA
Brushing past the indignant Aylesbury, who was examining the contents
of the shelves in the hut, he knelt upon the wooden seat and stared
intently through the open window.
NA
NA
NA
prominent eyes turned in the direction of the kneeling Harley. â€œOne,
two, three, four, and so on will settle it, eh? If you donâ€™t mind me

awakened by the sound of a shot. She immediately rang for Ah Tsong.
There was a short interval before Ah Tsong appeared--and when he did
appear he was wearing an overcoat. Note this point, Inspector: wearing
an overcoat. He descended to the study and found Mr. Camber writing.
Now, Ah Tsong sleeps in a room adjoining the kitchen on the ground
floor. We passed his quarters on our way to the garden a moment ago. Of
course, you had noted this? Mr. Camber is therefore eliminated from our

The Inspector was growing very red, but ere he had time to speak Harley
continued:
â€œThe first of these three persons to have heard a shot fired at the end
of the garden would have been Ah Tsong, and not Mrs. Camber, whose room
is upstairs and in the front of the house. If it had been fired by Mr.
Camber from the spot upon which we now stand, he would still have been
in the garden at the moment when Mrs. Camber was ringing the bell for
Ah Tsong. Mr. Camber must therefore have returned from the end of the
garden to the study, and have passed Ah Tsongâ€™s room--unheard by the
occupant--between the time that the bell rang and the time that Ah Tsong
went upstairs. This I submit to be impossible. There is an alternative:
it is that he slipped in whilst Ah Tsong, standing on the landing above,
was receiving his mistressâ€™s orders. I submit that the alternative is
also impossible. We thus eliminate Mr. Camber from the case, as I have

Harley? Allow me to point out to you, sir, that you are in no way

Harley spoke entirely without bitterness, and I, who knew his every
mood, realized that he was thoroughly enjoying himself. Therefore I knew
that at last he had found a clue.
NA
also eliminated Ah Tsong from the case. I forgot to mention that he
lacks the first and second fingers of his right hand; and I have yet
to meet the marksman who can shoot a man squarely between the eyes,
by moonlight, at a hundred yards, employing his third finger as
trigger-finger. There are other points, but these will be sufficient to
show you that this case is more complicated than you had assumed it to

Inspector Aylesbury did not deign to reply, or could not trust himself
to do so. He turned and made his way back to the house.
CHAPTER XXIV
AN OFFICIAL MOVE
We reÃ«ntered the study to find Mrs. Camber sitting in a chair very close
to her husband. Inspector Aylesbury stood in the open doorway for a
moment, and then, stepping back into the hall:
NA
NA
â€œGo out to the gate and get Edson to relieve you. I shall want you to go

NA
I scented what was coming, and as Inspector Aylesbury reentered the
room:

The Inspector frowned, and lowering his chin, regarded him with little
favour.

that you are about to take an important step officially. Having in view
certain steps which I, also, am about to take, I would ask you to defer
NA
NA
â€œVery well, Inspector. You have come newly into this case, and I assure
you that its apparent simplicity is illusive. As new facts come into
your possession you will realize that what I say is perfectly true, and
if you act now you will be acting hastily. All that I have learned I am
prepared to place at your disposal. But I predict that the interference
of Scotland Yard will be necessary before this enquiry is concluded.
Therefore I suggest, since you have rejected my cooperation, that you
obtain that of Detective Inspector Wessex, of the Criminal Investigation
Department. In short, this is no one-man job. You will do yourself harm
by jumping to conclusions, and cause unnecessary trouble to perfectly

He took his stand before the fireplace, very erect, and invested with
his most official manner. Mrs. Camber watched him in a way that was
pathetic. Camber seemed to be quite composed, although his face was
unusually pale.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Thereupon the long-repressed wrath of Inspector Aylesbury burst forth.
NA
NA
NA
unperturbed. He turned to Colin Camber. â€œI happen to be a member of the

Camber stood up, bowing formally.
The expression upon the inflamed face of Inspector Aylesbury was really
indescribable, and recognizing his mental limitations, I was almost
tempted to feel sorry for him. However, he did not lack self-confidence,
and:
NA
perceptible in his voice, â€œbut I know my duty and I am not afraid to
perform it. Now, Mr. Camber, did you, or did you not, at about twelve

Inspector Aylesbury uttered a choking sound, but:

oâ€™clock last night, shoot, with intent to murder, Colonel Juan

Ysola Camber leapt up, clutching at her husbandâ€™s arm as if to hold him
back.
NA
NA
Harley whilst he spoke, â€œI am going to detain you pending further

Colin Camber inclined his head.
NA
The little fingers clutching his sleeve slowly relaxed, and Mrs. Camber,
uttering a long sigh, sank in a swoon at his feet.
NA
NA
NA
I sprang to the door and held it widely open.
Colin Camber, deadly pale, but holding his head very erect, walked in
the direction of the hallway with his pathetic burden. Mis-reading the
purpose written upon the stern white face, Inspector Aylesbury stepped
forward.
NA
NA
His detaining hand was already upon Camberâ€™s shoulder when Harleyâ€™s arm
shot out like a barrier across the Inspectorâ€™s chest, and Colin Camber
proceeded on his way. Momentarily, he glanced aside, and I saw that his
eyes were unnaturally bright.
NA
Harley dropped his arm, and crossing, stood staring out of the window.
Inspector Aylesbury ran heavily to the door.
NA
NA
I heard the sound of heavy footsteps following Camberâ€™s up the stairs,
then Inspector Aylesbury turned, a bulky figure in the open doorway,
and:
NA
barrister, I understand. Very well, then, I suppose you are aware that
you have resisted and obstructed an officer of the law in the execution
NA
Paul Harley spun round upon his heel.
NA
The two glared at one another for a moment, then:

trouble with you, Mr. Harley. In the first place, Iâ€™ll have you looked
up in the Law List; in the second place, I shall ask you to stick to

NA

declined all my offers, and finally, upon the most flimsy evidence, you

â€œPerfectly innocent, Inspector. There are so many points that you have
overlooked. For instance, do you seriously suppose that Mr. Camber had
been waiting up here night after night on the off-chance that Colonel

NA
strangely reluctant to mention Mr. Camberâ€™s name. It was only after very
keen examination that I got it at last. Now, Colonel Menendez had not
retired last night, neither had a certain other party. That other
party, sir, knows why Colonel Menendez was wandering about the garden at
NA
At first, I think, this astonishing innuendo did not fully penetrate
to my mind, but when it did so, it seemed to galvanize me. Springing up
from the chair in which I had been seated:
NA
It was the last straw. Inspector Aylesbury strode to the door and
throwing it open once more, turned to me:
NA
NA
I think I could have strangled him with pleasure, but even in my rage
I was not foolhardy enough to lay myself open to that of which the
Inspector was quite capable at this moment.
Without another word I walked out of the study, took my hat and stick,
and opening the front door, quitted the Guest House, from which I had
thus a second time been dismissed ignominiously.
Appreciation of this fact, which came to me as I stepped into the porch,
awakened my sense of humour--a gift truly divine which has saved many
a man from desperation or worse. I felt like a schoolboy who had been
turned out of a class-room, and I was glad that I could laugh at myself.
A constable was standing in the porch, and he looked at me suspiciously.
No doubt he perceived something very sardonic in my merriment.
I walked out of the gate, before which a car was standing, and as I
paused to light a cigarette I heard the door of the Guest House open and
close. I glanced back, and there was Paul Harley coming to join me.
NA
â€œMy dear Harley, I am both angry and bewildered. Too angry and too
NA
â€œI can quite understand it. I should become homicidal if I were forced
to submit for long to the company of Inspector Aylesbury. Of course, I
had anticipated the arrest of Colin Camber, and I fear there is worse to

NA
â€œI mean that failing the apprehension of the real murderer, I cannot

â€œBut surely you demonstrated out there in the garden that he could not

â€œWords, Knox, words. I could pick a dozen loopholes in my own argument.
I had only hoped to defer the inevitable. I tell you, there is worse to

NA
â€œWe must persuade the man on duty to allow us to examine the Tudor
garden, and we must see the Chief Constable, whoever he may be, and
prevail upon him to requisition the assistance of Scotland Yard.
With Wessex in charge of the case I might have a chance. Whilst this

brilliant idea last night, and his ideas are too few to be lightly
scrapped. If the Chief Constable is anything like the Inspector, what we

NA
Harley did not answer for a moment, whereupon I glanced at him
anxiously, then:
NA
not presume to say of what he is capable or is not capable. The
most significant point in his favour is this: He is a man of unusual
intellect. The planning of this cunning crime to such a man would have
been childâ€™s play--childâ€™s play, Knox. But is it possible to believe
that his genius would have failed him upon the most essential detail of

NA
â€œOf course it is not. Which, continuing to regard Camber as an assassin,
reduces us to the theory that the crime was committed in a moment
of passion. This I maintain to be also impossible. It was no deed of

point. If I am wrong in this, then perhaps I am wrong in my whole
conception of the case. But have you considered the mass of evidence

NA
â€œThink of all that we know, and which the Inspector does not know. Every
single datum points in the same direction. No prosecution could ask for
a more perfect case. Upon this fact I pin my hopes. Where an Aylesbury
rushes in I fear to tread. The analogy with an angel was accidental,
NA
I have failed once, Knox, failed disastrously, and it may be that in my
anxiety to justify myself I am seeking for subtlety where no subtlety
NA
CHAPTER XXV
AYLESBURYâ€™S THEORY
There were strangers about Crayâ€™s Folly and a sort of furtive activity,
horribly suggestive. We had not pursued the circular route by the high
road which would have brought us to the lodge, but had turned aside
where the swing-gate opened upon a footpath into the meadows. It was the
path which I had pursued upon the day of my visit to the Lavender
Arms. A second private gate here gave access to the grounds at a point
directly opposite the lake; and as we crossed the valley, making for the
terraced lawns, I saw unfamiliar figures upon the veranda, and knew that
the cumbersome processes of the law were already in motion.
I was longing to speak to Val Beverley and to learn what had taken place
during her interview with Inspector Aylesbury, but Harley led the way
toward the tower wing, and by a tortuous path through the rhododendrons
we finally came out on the northeast front and in sight of the Tudor
garden.
Harley crossed to the entrance, and was about to descend the steps, when
the constable on duty there held out his arm.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
My friend uttered an impatient exclamation, but, turning aside:
NA
NA
to be a martinet as well as a walrus. At every step, Knox, he proves
NA
NA
NA
NA
He hurried on through the opening in the box hedge and into the
courtyard. Manoel had just opened the doors to a sepulchral-looking
person who proved to be the coronerâ€™s officer, and:
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI am off to see the Chief Constable, Knox. Aylesbury must be superseded
at whatever cost. If the Chief Constable fails I shall not hesitate to
go higher. I will get along to the garage. I donâ€™t expect to be more
than an hour. Meanwhile, do your best to act as a buffer between
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
With that he was off, eager-eyed and alert, the mood of dreamy
abstraction dropped like a cloak discarded. He fully realized, as I did,
that his unique reputation was at stake. I wondered, as I had wondered
at the Guest House, whether, in undertaking to clear Colin Camber, he
had acted upon sheer conviction, or, embittered by the death of his
client, had taken a gamblerâ€™s chance. It was unlike him to do so. But
now beyond reach of that charm of manner which Colin Camber possessed,
and discounting the pathetic sweetness of his girl-wife, I realized how
black was the evidence against him.
Occupied with these, and even more troubled thoughts, I was making my
way toward the library, undetermined how to act, when I saw Val Beverley
coming along the corridor which communicated with Madame de StÃ¤merâ€™s
room.
I read a welcome in her eyes which made my heart beat the faster.
NA
NA
I nodded gravely.
â€œYou know, then, where Inspector Aylesbury went when he left here, after
NA
She looked at me pathetically.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
presumably one of the servants, that there was enmity between Mr. Camber
and Colonel Menendez. He asked me if I knew of this, and of course I
had to admit that I did. But when I told him that I had no idea of its
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œthat I was intimately acquainted with Mr. Camber. Whereas, of course, I
have never spoken to him in my life, although whenever he has passed me
in the road he has always saluted me with quite delightful courtesy.
Oh, Mr. Knox, it is horrible to think of this great misfortune coming to
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œand go to her, and try to comfort her. Because I feel in my very soul
that her husband is innocent. She is such a sweet little thing. I have
wanted to speak to her since the very first time I ever saw her, but on
the rare occasions when we have met in the village she has hurried
past as though she were afraid of me. Mr. Harley surely knows that her

NA
NA
NA
agitatedly she turned her head aside.
NA
NA
attach a ridiculous importance to the fact that I had not retired last
NA
NA
â€œI told him the truth of the matter, which is surely quite simple, and
at first I was unable to understand the nature of his suspicions. Then,
after a time, his questions enlightened me. He finally suggested, quite
openly, that I had not come down from my room to the corridor in which
NA
NA
â€œYes. He seemed to think that I had just come in from the door near
the end of the east wing and beside the tower, which opens into the
NA
NA
NA
Val Beverleyâ€™s face had been very pale, but now she flushed indignantly,
and glanced away from me as she replied:
NA
NA
NA
may regard Inspector Aylesbury as an enemy from now onward, for when
I had recovered from the shock I told him very plainly what I thought
NA
NA
is through with this business I fancy he will know more about his
limitations than he knows at present. The fact of the matter is that he
is badly out of his depth, but is not man enough to acknowledge the fact
NA
She smiled at me pathetically.
NA
I was tempted to direct the conversation into a purely personal channel,
but common sense prevailed, and:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œHow could I do otherwise? She was quite composed, wonderfully composed;
and the way she heard the news was simply heroic. But here is Dr.
NA
I glanced along the corridor, and there was the physician approaching
briskly.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œDo you hold any hope of her permanently recovering the use of her
NA
Dr. Rolleston shook his head doubtfully.
NA
affections are very fickle. It is unsafe to make predictions. But
mentally, at least, she is quite restored from the effects of last
nightâ€™s shock. You need apprehend no hysteria or anything of that
NA
NA
We all three turned, and there was Inspector Aylesbury crossing the hall
in our direction.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œShe is somewhat better. If she cares to see you I do not forbid the
NA
NA
NA
Val Beverley looked at me appealingly then shrugged her shoulders,
turned aside, and walked in the direction of Madame de StÃ¤merâ€™s door.
NA
must be getting along. Good morning, Mr. Knox. Good morning, Inspector
NA
He walked rapidly out to his waiting car. The presence of Inspector
Aylesbury exercised upon Dr. Rolleston a similar effect to that which
a red rag has upon a bull. As he took his departure, the Inspector drew
out his pocket-book, and, humming gently to himself, began to consult
certain entries therein, with a portentous air of reflection which would
have been funny if it had not been so irritating.
Thus we stood when Val Beverley returned, and:

CHAPTER XXVI
IN MADAMEâ€™S ROOM
Madame de StÃ¤merâ€™s apartment was a large and elegant one. From the
window-drapings, which were of some light, figured satiny material, to
the bed-cover, the lampshades and the carpet, it was French. Faintly
perfumed, and decorated with many bowls of roses, it reflected, in its
ornaments, its pictures, its slender-legged furniture, the personality
of the occupant. In a large, high bed, reclining amidst a number of
silken pillows, lay Madame de StÃ¤mer. The theme of the room was violet
and silver, and to this everything conformed. The toilet service was of
dull silver and violet enamel. The mirrors and some of the pictures
had dull silver frames, There was nothing tawdry or glittering. The bed
itself, which I thought resembled a bed of state, was of the same dull
silver, with a coverlet of delicate violet I hue. But Madameâ€™s dÃ©colletÃ©
robe was trimmed with white fur, so that her hair, dressed high upon her
head, seemed to be of silver, too.
Reclining there upon her pillows, she looked like some grande dame of
that France which was swept away by the Revolution. Immediately above
the dressing-table I observed a large portrait of Colonel Menendez
dressed as I had imagined he should be dressed when I had first set eyes
on him, in tropical riding kit, and holding a broad-brimmed hat in his
hand. A strikingly handsome, arrogant figure he made, uncannily like the
Velasquez in the library.
At the face of Madame de StÃ¤mer I looked long and searchingly. She had
not neglected the art of the toilette. Blinds tempered the sunlight
which flooded her room; but that, failing the service of rouge, Madame
had been pale this morning, I perceived immediately. In some subtle
way the night had changed her. Something was gone out of her face, and
something come into it. I thought, and lived to remember the thought,
that it was thus Marie Antoinette might have looked when they told her
how the drums had rolled in the Place de la Revolution on that morning
of the twenty-first of January.
NA
beside me, my friend. Val, dear, remain. Is this Inspector Aylesbury who

The Inspector, who had entered with all the confidence in the world,
seemed to lose some of it in the presence of this grand lady, who was so
little impressed by the dignity of his office.
She waved one slender hand in the direction of a violet brocaded chair.
NA

Inspector Aylesbury cleared his throat and sat down.
NA

NA
absence is due to the fact that at this hour he is hot upon the trail of

NA
NA
â€œHe is following a clue, Madame de StÃ¤mer, which he hopes will lead to
NA
NA
NA
NA
She shook her head, smiling with such a resigned sadness that I averted
my gaze and glanced across at Val Beverley who was seated on the
opposite side of the bed.
NA
I looked again into the tragic face, and realized that this was an older
woman than the brilliant hostess I had known. She sighed, shrugged, and:
NA
NA
NA
NA
torture upon herself.
â€œThey say he must be taken away, M. Knox, but I reply: not until I have
NA
NA
NA
extended one hand in her direction, the fingers characteristically
curled. â€œYou do not know me. Perhaps it is a good job. You are a man,
Mr. Knox, and men, especially men who write, know more of women than
they know of themselves, is it not so? You will understand that I must

NA
She shrugged her shoulders.
â€œI am not proud to be brave, my friend. The animals are brave, but many

NA
â€œSo Dr. Rolleston assures me. He died in his sleep? You do not think he

her white fingers, glancing across the room to where Inspector
Aylesbury, very subdued, sat upon the brocaded chair twirling his cap

endeavour to recover his dignity, but:
NA

He resumed his seat, clearing his throat nervously.
NA
NA
NA
Her vibrant voice was very low.
NA
NA
NA
Madame shrugged and glanced at me eloquently.
NA
Pedro, the butler, that Colonel Menendez looked upon Mr. Camber as an
enemy, and Miss Beverley, here, admitted that it was true. Yet although
he was an enemy, nobody ever seems to have spoken to him, and he swears
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The Inspector cleared his throat again, then:
NA
Madame nodded.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThere were doors unfastened, and a great disturbance, so I suppose
NA
I wondered if he would refer to the bat wing nailed to the door, but he
had evidently decided that this clue was without importance, nor did
he once refer to the aspect of the case which concerned Voodoo. He
possessed a sort of mulish obstinacy, and was evidently determined to
use no scrap of information which he had obtained from Paul Harley.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
 He turned ponderously in his chair, gazing out of the windows. â€œWe
look out on the south here? You say the sound of the shot came from the
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI was so startled that I ran to the door before I remembered that I

She glanced aside at me with a tired smile, and laid her hand upon my
arm in an oddly caressing way, as if to say, â€œHe is so stupid; I should

Truly enough the Inspector misunderstood, for:
NA
NA
NA
â€œThe fright, the terror, gave me strength to stagger to the door, and
NA
â€œOh, I see. You speak of fright and terror. Were these caused by the
NA
NA
Madame. â€œHe went in dread of assassination, you understand? Very well,
he caused me to feel this dread, also. When I heard the shot, something
NA
NA
Val Beverley was watching Madame de StÃ¤mer anxiously, and the fact that
she was unfit to undergo further examination was so obvious that any
other than an Inspector Aylesbury would have withdrawn. The latter,
however, seemed now to be glued to his chair, and:
NA
NA
Madame de StÃ¤mer lowered her hands and gazed across at the speaker.
NA
NA
NA
â€œWell, it isnâ€™t natural for a man to go walking about the garden at
midnight, when heâ€™s unwell, is it? Not alone. But if there was a lady in

arrived here last night. I found that out, although she didnâ€™t give me a

His words had an effect more dramatic than he could have foreseen.
Madame de StÃ¤mer threw her arm around Val Beverley, and hugged her so
closely to her side that the girlâ€™s curly brown head was pressed against
Madameâ€™s shoulder. Thus holding her, she sat rigidly upright, her
strange, still eyes glaring across the room at Inspector Aylesbury.
Her whole pose was instinct with challenge, with defiance, and in that
moment I identified the illusive memory which the eyes of Madame so
often had conjured up in my mind.
Once, years before, I had seen a wounded tigress standing over her cubs,
a beautiful, fearless creature, blazing defiance with dying eyes upon
those who had destroyed her, the mother-instinct supreme to the last;
for as she fell to rise no more she had thrown her paw around the
cowering cubs. It was not in shape, nor in colour, but in expression and
in their stillness, that the eyes of Madame de StÃ¤mer resembled the eyes
of the tigress.

NA
unmoving stare set upon the face of the discomfited Inspector Aylesbury.
NA
direction of the door, but even yet the fingers remained curled.
NA
Inspector Aylesbury stood up, his face very flushed.
NA
NA
Convulsively she held Val Beverley to her side, and although I could not
see the girlâ€™s face, I knew that she was weeping.
Those implacable flaming eyes followed with their stare the figure of
the Inspector right to the doorway, for he essayed no further speech,
but retired.
I, also, rose, and:
NA
NA
She threw back her head, smiling up at me. I shall never forget that
look, nor shall I attempt to portray all which it conveyed--for I know I
should fail.
NA
CHAPTER XXVII
AN INSPIRATION
Inspector Aylesbury had disappeared when I came out of the hall,
but Pedro was standing there to remind me of the fact that I had not
breakfasted. I realized that despite all tragic happenings, I was
ravenously hungry, and accordingly I agreed to his proposal that I
should take breakfast on the south veranda, as on the previous morning.
To the south veranda accordingly I made my way, rather despising myself
because I was capable of hunger at such a time and amidst such horrors.
The daily papers were on my table, for Carter drove into Market Hilton
every morning to meet the London train which brought them down; but I
did not open any of them.
Pedro waited upon me in person. I could see that the man was
pathetically anxious to talk. Accordingly, when he presently brought me
a fresh supply of hot rolls:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAnd do you know anything of the previous attempts which had been made
NA
NA
NA
He looked at me in a startled way.
NA
NA
â€œI thought it was a joke, sir--not a nice joke--by someone who knew
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI had heard SeÃ±or Don Juan say that Mr. Camber hated him, so I thought
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
The man withdrew, and I continued my solitary meal, listening to the
song of the skylarks, and thinking how complex was human existence,
compared with any other form of life beneath the sun.
How to employ my time until Harley should return I knew not. Common
delicacy dictated an avoidance of Val Beverley until she should have
recovered from the effect of Inspector Aylesburyâ€™s gross insinuations,
and I was curiously disinclined to become involved in the gloomy
formalities which ensue upon a crime of violence. Nevertheless, I
felt compelled to remain within call, realizing that there might
be unpleasant duties which Pedro could not perform, and which must
therefore devolve upon Val Beverley.
I lighted my pipe and walked out on to the sloping lawn. A gardener
was at work with a big syringe, destroying a patch of weeds which had
appeared in one corner of the velvet turf. He looked up in a sort of
startled way as I passed, bidding me good morning, and then resuming his
task. I thought that this manâ€™s activities were symbolic of the way of
the world, in whose eternal progression one poor human life counts as
nothing.
Presently I came in sight of that door which opened into the
rhododendron shrubbery, the door by which Colonel Menendez had come out
to meet his death. His bedroom was directly above, and as I picked my
way through the closely growing bushes, which at an earlier time I had
thought to be impassable, I paused in the very shadow of the tower
and glanced back and upward. I could see the windows of the little
smoke-room in which we had held our last interview with Menendez; and I
thought of the shadow which Harley had seen upon the blind. I was unable
to disguise from myself the fact that when Inspector Aylesbury should
learn of this occurrence, as presently he must do, it would give new
vigour to his ridiculous and unpleasant suspicions.
I passed on, and considering the matter impartially, found myself faced
by the questions--Whose was the shadow which Harley had seen upon the
blind? And with what purpose did Colonel Menendez leave the house at
midnight?
Somnambulism might solve the second riddle, but to the first I could
find no answer acceptable to my reason. And now, pursuing my aimless
way, I presently came in sight of a gable of the Guest House. I could
obtain a glimpse of the hut which had once been Colin Camberâ€™s workroom.
The window, through which Paul Harley had stared so intently, possessed
sliding panes. These were closed, and a ray of sunlight, striking upon
the glass, produced, because of an over-leaning branch which crossed the
top of the window, an effect like that of a giant eye glittering evilly
through the trees. I could see a constable moving about in the garden.
Ever and anon the sun shone upon the buttons of his tunic.
By such steps my thoughts led me on to the pathetic figure of Ysola
Camber. Save for the faithful Ah Tsong she was alone in that house to
which tragedy had come unbidden, unforeseen. I doubted if she had a
woman friend in all the countryside. Doubtless, I reflected, the old
housekeeper, to whom she had referred, would return as speedily as
possible, but pending the arrival of someone to whom she could confide
all her sorrows, I found it almost impossible to contemplate the
loneliness of the tragic little figure.
Such was my mental state, and my thoughts were all of compassion, when
suddenly, like a lurid light, an inspiration came to me.
I had passed out from the shadow of the tower and was walking in the
direction of the sentinel yews when this idea, dreadfully complete,
leapt to my mind. I pulled up short, as though hindered by a palpable
barrier. Vague musings, evanescent theories, vanished like smoke, and a
ghastly, consistent theory of the crime unrolled itself before me, with
all the cold logic of truth.
NA
CHAPTER XXVIII
MY THEORY OF THE CRIME
The afternoon was well advanced before Paul Harley returned.
So deep was my conviction that I had hit upon the truth, and so well
did my theory stand every test which I could apply to it, that I felt
disinclined for conversation with any one concerned in the tragedy until
I should have submitted the matter to the keen analysis of Harley. Upon
the sorrow of Madame de StÃ¤mer I naturally did not intrude, nor did I
seek to learn if she had carried out her project of looking upon the
dead man.
About mid-day the body was removed, after which an oppressive and
awesome stillness seemed to descend upon Crayâ€™s Folly.
Inspector Aylesbury had not returned from his investigations at the
Guest House, and learning that Miss Beverley was remaining with Madame
de StÃ¤mer, I declined to face the ordeal of a solitary luncheon in
the dining room, and merely ate a few sandwiches, walking over to the
Lavender Arms for a glass of Mrs. Woottonâ€™s excellent ale.
Here I found the bar-parlour full of local customers, and although a
heated discussion was in progress as I opened the door, silence fell
upon my appearance. Mrs. Wootton greeted me sadly.
NA
NA
NA
guest at Crayâ€™s Folly.
NA
NA
She retired to some sanctum at the rear of the bar, and I drank my beer
amid one of those silences which sometimes descend upon such a gathering
when a stranger appears in its midst. Not until I moved to depart was
this silence broken, then:
NA
NA
NA
I came out of the Lavender Arms full of a knowledge that so far as
Mid-Hatton was concerned, Colin Camber was already found guilty.
I had hoped to see something of Val Beverley on my return, but she
remained closeted with Madame de StÃ¤mer, and I was left in loneliness
to pursue my own reflections, and to perfect that theory which had
presented itself to my mind.
In Harleyâ€™s absence I had taken it upon myself to give an order to Pedro
to the effect that no reporters were to be admitted; and in this I had
done well. So quickly does evil news fly that, between mid-day and
the hour of Harleyâ€™s return, no fewer than five reporters, I believe,
presented themselves at Crayâ€™s Folly. Some of the more persistent
continued to haunt the neighbourhood, and I had withdrawn to the
deserted library, in order to avoid observation, when I heard a car draw
up in the courtyard, and a moment later heard Harley asking for me.
I hurried out to meet him, and as I appeared at the door of the library:
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œI had half anticipated it, Knox. The Chief Constable, although quite a
decent fellow, is a stickler for routine. On the strength of those
facts which I thought fit to place before him he could see no reason
for superseding Aylesbury. Accordingly, without further waste of time,
I headed straight for Whitehall. You may remember a somewhat elaborate
report which I completed upon the eve of our departure from Chancery
NA
I nodded.
â€œA very thankless job for the Home Office, Knox. But I received my
reward to-day. Inspector Wessex has been placed in charge of the case
and I hope he will be down here within the hour. Pending his arrival I
NA
We had walked into the library, and, stopping, suddenly, Harley stared
me very hard in the face.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œIt is a theory, Harley, which appears to me to cover the facts of the
NA
NA
â€œI was staring up at the window of the smoke-room to-day, and I
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œVery well, then, I will endeavour to be brief. Do you recollect Miss
Beverleyâ€™s story of the unfamiliar footsteps which passed her door on
NA
NA
â€œYou recollect that you, yourself, heard someone crossing the hall, and
NA
NA
â€œAnd finally you saw the shadow of a woman upon the blind of the
Colonelâ€™s private study. Very well. Excluding the preposterous theory of
Inspector Aylesbury, there is no woman in Crayâ€™s Folly whose footsteps
could possibly have been heard in that corridor, and whose shadow could
NA
NA
NA
â€œI will do so. There is a door on the south side of the house, close to
the tower and opening into the rhododendron shrubbery. This was the door
used by Colonel Menendez in his somnambulistic rambles, according to
his own account. Now, assuming his statement to have been untrue in one
particular, that is, assuming he was not walking in his sleep, but was
NA
NA
NA
â€œAccording to my theory, Harley, his statement was untrue, in this
particular, at least. But to proceed: Might he not have employed this
NA
NA
â€œFor the Colonel to descend to this side door when the household was
NA
would have been a simple matter. Indeed, on the occasions of these
visits he might even have unbolted the door himself after Pedro had
bolted it, in order to enable her to enter without his descending for
NA
NA
His eyes were gleaming excitedly, and I proceeded:
â€œHence the footsteps which passed Miss Beverleyâ€™s door, hence the shadow
which you saw upon the blind; and the sounds which you detected in the
hall were caused, of course, by this woman retiring. It was the door
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œMy theory also explains Colin Camberâ€™s lapse from sobriety. It is
legitimate to suppose that his wife, who was a Cuban, had been intimate
with Menendez before her meeting with Camber. Perhaps she had broken the
tie at the time of her marriage, but this is mere supposition. Then,
her old lover, his infatuation by no means abated, leases the property
NA
NA
NA
NA
clandestinely. Colin Camber learns of these. A passionate quarrel
ensues, resulting in a long drinking bout designed to drown his
sorrows. His love for his wife is so great that he has forgiven her this
infidelity. Accordingly, she has promised to see her lover no more. Hers
was the figure which you saw outlined upon the blind on the night before
the tragedy, Harley! The gestures, which you described as those of
NA
NA
to suppose, Knox, that these visits to Crayâ€™s Folly were made whilst her
husband was at work in the study. If he had suddenly decided to turn in,
NA
NA
NA
â€œVery well. Colonel Menendez has refused to accept his dismissal, and
Mrs. Camber had been compelled to promise, without necessarily intending
to carry out the promise, that she would see him again on the following
night. She failed to come; whereupon he, growing impatient, walked out
into the grounds of Crayâ€™s Folly to look for her. She may even have
intended to come and have been intercepted by her husband. But in any
event, the latter, seeing the man who had wronged him, standing out
there in the moonlight, found temptation to be too strong. On the whole,
I favour the idea that he had intercepted his wife, and snatching up
a rifle, had actually gone out into the garden with the intention of

CHAPTER XXIX
A LEE-ENFIELD RIFLE
What reply I should have offered to this astonishing remark I cannot
say, but at that moment the library door burst open unceremoniously, and
outlined against the warmly illuminated hall, where sunlight poured down
through the dome, I beheld the figure of Inspector Aylesbury.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œOh, I see. And have you quite convinced yourself that Colin Camber is

NA
â€œOh, in one or two particulars, eh? But generally speaking you donâ€™t

NA
Harleyâ€™s words surprised me. I recognized, of course, that he might
merely be bluffing the Inspector, but it was totally alien to his
character to score a rhetorical success at the expense of what he knew
to be the truth; and so sure was I of the accuracy of my deductions that
I no longer doubted Colin Camber to be the guilty man.

He was blatantly triumphant, so that the fact was evident enough that
he had obtained some further piece of evidence which he regarded as
conclusive.

regarding the person who lured Colonel Menendez out into the grounds

I turned aside, unable to trust myself, but Harley remarked quite
coolly:
â€œYour industry is admirable, Inspector Aylesbury, but I seem to perceive

NA
NA
NA
NA

that little hut in the grounds of the Guest House, like you did, Mr.
Harley, and saying â€˜twice one are twoâ€™--I looked at every book on the

glancing at Harley, I saw that his face had grown suddenly very stern.

of the cloth I could see that he had clenched his fists. Here was
confirmation of my theory!

He picked up the bag and walked out of the library.
Harley stood posed in a curiously rigid way, looking after him. Even
when the door had closed he did not change his position at once. Then,
turning slowly, he walked to an armchair and sat down.
NA
NA
NA
rather resentfully, â€œall the time you continued to believe Colin Camber

NA
NA
NA
Camberâ€™s genius, having decided upon murder, must have arranged for an
unassailable alibi. Very well. Are we now to leap to the other end
of the scale, and to credit him with such utter stupidity as to place
hanging evidence where it could not fail to be discovered by the most
idiotic policeman? Preserve your balance, Knox. Theories are wild
horses. They run away with us. I know that of old, for which very reason
I always avoid speculation until I have a solid foundation of fact upon

NA
NA
Harley sighed, and leaned back in his chair.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œExactly. Although not quite sober, from a mere glance he was able to
detect what you were thinking. Do you wish me to believe, Knox, that
this same man had not foreseen what the police would think when Colonel
Menendez was found shot within a hundred yards of the garden of the

He took out his pipe and began to fill it.
NA
I took a seat facing him, and he did not once interrupt me throughout my
account of Inspector Aylesburyâ€™s examination of Madame.
NA
â€œBut at least, Knox, he has a working theory, to which he sticks like an
express to the main line, whereas I find myself constantly called upon
to readjust my perspective. Directly I can enjoy freedom of movement,
however, I shall know whether my hypothesis is a house of cards or a

NA
NA
â€œNot entirely different, Knox, merely not so comprehensive. I have
contented myself thus far with a negative theory, if I may so express
NA
NA
â€œExactly. We are dealing, my dear fellow, with a case of bewildering

NA
NA
â€œPrecisely, Knox. Respecting the person or persons who did do it, I
had preserved a moderately open mind, up to the moment that Inspector

CHAPTER XXX
THE SEVENTH YEW TREE
Detective-Inspector Wessex arrived at about five oâ€™clock; a quiet,
resourceful man, highly competent, and having the appearance of an
ex-soldier. His respect for the attainments of Paul Harley alone marked
him a student of character. I knew Wessex well, and was delighted when
Pedro showed him into the library.
NA
greetings. â€œAt last I can move. Have you seen the local officer in

shortcoming with which nature endowed him, therefore we must endeavour
to let Inspector Aylesbury down as lightly as possible. I have an idea

He walked out into the hall to make enquiries, and a few moments later I
heard Inspector Aylesburyâ€™s voice.
NA
NA
The Inspector entered, frowning heavily, followed by my friend.
â€œThere is no earthly reason why we should get at loggerheads over this
NA
Aylesbury, that there are depths in this case to which neither you nor
I have yet succeeded in penetrating. You have a reputation to consider,
and so have I. Therefore I am sure you will welcome the cooperation of

Inspector Aylesbury took out his handkerchief and blew his nose loudly,

him the facts of my case. Nevertheless, if you want to examine the

He turned without another word and stamped out of the library across the
hall and into the courtyard.
NA
following.
NA
NA
I joined Harley, and we walked together up the gravelled path, meeting
Inspector Aylesbury and the constable returning.
NA
NA
Harley nodded good-humouredly, and together we descended the steps to
the sunken garden. I was intensely curious respecting the investigation
which Harley had been so anxious to make here, for I recognized that
it was associated with something which he had seen from the window of
Camberâ€™s hut.
He walked along the moss-grown path to the sun-dial, and stood for a
moment looking down at the spot where Menendez had lain. Then he stared
up the hill toward the Guest House; and finally, directing his attention
to the yews which lined the sloping bank:
NA
NA
He mounted the bank and began to examine the trunk of one of the trees,
whilst I watched him in growing astonishment.
Presently he turned and looked down at me.
NA
He moved along to the yew adjoining that which he had already inspected,
but presently shook his head and passed to the next. Then:
NA
I joined him where he was kneeling, staring at what I took to be a large
nail, or bolt, protruding from the bark of the tree.
NA
I stooped, in order to examine the thing more closely, and as I did
so, I realized what it was. It was the bullet which had killed Colonel
Menendez!
Harley stood upright, his face slightly flushed and his eyes very
bright.
NA
penetration may have a tale to tell. The wood of the yew tree is one of

NA
NA

â€œThen I am utterly out of my depth, Harley. It, appears to me that the
case against Camber is finally and fatally complete. Only the motive
remains to be discovered, and I flatter myself that I have already

I stood quite still.
NA
â€œI told you that the test of my theory, Knox, was to be looked for in

â€œYou did. And it is there. A bullet fired from a Lee-Enfield rifle;

I was still groping for the significance of this point when, re-crossing
the hall, we entered the library again, to find Inspector Aylesbury
posed squarely before the mantelpiece stating his case to Wessex.
NA
â€œevery little detail fits perfectly into place. For instance, I find
that a woman, called Mrs. Powis, who for the past two years had acted as
housekeeper at the Guest House and never taken a holiday, was sent away
recently to her married daughter in London. See what that means? Her
room is at the back of the house, and her evidence would have been
fatal. Ah Tsong, of course, is a liar. I made up my mind about that the
moment I clapped eyes on him. Mrs. Camber is the only innocent party.
She was asleep in the front of the house when the shot was fired, and
I believe her when she says that she cannot swear to the matter of

CHAPTER XXXI
YSOLA CAMBERâ€™S CONFESSION
Paul Harley, with Wessex and Inspector Aylesbury, presently set out for
Market Hilton, where Colin Camber and Ah Tsong were detained and where
the body of Colonel Menendez had been conveyed for the purpose of the
post-mortem. I had volunteered to remain at Crayâ€™s Folly, my motive
being not wholly an unselfish one.
NA
NA
The drone of the engine having died away down the avenue, I presently
found myself alone, but as I crossed the hall in the direction of
the library, intending to walk out upon the southern lawns, I saw Val
Beverley coming toward me from Madame de StÃ¤merâ€™s room.
She remained rather pale, but smiled at me courageously.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œShe is quite calm. Curiously, almost uncannily calm. She is writing.
Tell me, please, what does Mr. Harley think of Inspector Aylesburyâ€™s
NA
NA
â€œBut whatever will happen if he persists in dragging me into this
NA
NA
by a cleverer man, and the case is practically under Harleyâ€™s direction
NA
NA
hesitatingly.
NA
â€œI have been thinking about poor Mrs. Camber all alone in that gloomy
NA
NA
Val Beverley nodded, watching me.
NA
NA
â€œAnd may I accompany you, Miss Beverley? For more reasons than one, I,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
As a result, I presently found myself, Val Beverley by my side, walking
across the meadow path. With the unpleasant hush of Crayâ€™s Folly left
behind, the day seemed to grow brighter. I thought that the skylarks had
never sung more sweetly. Yet in this same instant of sheerly physical
enjoyment I experienced a pang of remorse, remembering the tragic woman
we had left behind, and the poor little sorrowful girl we were going to
visit. My emotions were very mingled, then, and I retain no recollection
of our conversation up to the time that we came to the Guest House.
We were admitted by a really charming old lady, who informed us that her
name was Mrs. Powis and that she was but an hour returned from London,
whither she had been summoned by telegram.
She showed us into a quaint, small drawing room which owed its
atmosphere quite clearly to Mrs. Camber, for whereas the study was
indescribably untidy, this was a model of neatness without being formal
or unhomely. Here, in a few moments, Mrs. Camber joined us, an appealing
little figure of wistful, almost elfin, beauty. I was surprised and
delighted to find that an instant bond of sympathy sprang up between the
two girls. I diplomatically left them together for a while, going into
Camberâ€™s room to smoke my pipe. And when I returned:
NA
NA
NA
Mrs. Camber nodded her golden head.
NA
confidence. â€œThe truth can never hurt Colin. He has nothing to conceal.
NA
NA
NA
Mrs. Camber reached across and took her hand.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
She became silent, sitting looking straight before her, the pupils of
her blue eyes widely dilated. Then, at first in a queer, far-away voice,
she began to speak again.
NA
NA
I started.
â€œYsola was my baby way of saying it, and so I came to be called Ysola.
My father was manager of one of SeÃ±or Don Juanâ€™s estates, in a small
NA
NA
She looked pleadingly at Val Beverley.
NA
NA
NA
not, but there, where I was born, oh! so much. Well, then, my mother
died when I was very little. Ah Tsong was her servant. There are many
Chinese in the West Indies, you see, and I can just remember he carried
me in to see her. Of course I didnâ€™t understand. My father quarrelled
bitterly with the priests because they would not bury her in holy
ground. I think he no longer believed afterward. I loved him very much.
He was good to me; and I was a queen in that little island. All
the negroes loved me, because of my mother, I think, who was partly
descended from slaves, as they were. But I had not begun to understand
how hard it was all going to be when my father sent me to a convent in
Cuba.
â€œI hated to go, but while I was there I learned all about myself. I knew
NA
I was only fifteen when I came home, but all the same I was a woman. I
was no more a child, and happy no longer. After a while, perhaps, when
I forgot what I had suffered at the convent, I became less miserable.
My father did all in his power to make me happy, and I was glad the

Her eyes filled with tears.

parts of the island at night, Ah Tsong slept outside my door? Some of
them say, â€˜Do not trust the Chineseâ€™ I say, except my husband and my
father, I have never known another one to trust but Ah Tsong. Now they
NA
Tears glittered on her lashes, but she brushed them aside angrily, and
continued:
â€œI was still less than twenty, and looked, they told me, only fourteen,
when SeÃ±or Menendez came to inspect his estate. I had never seen him
before. There had been a rising in the island, in the year after I was
born, and he had only just escaped with his life. He was hated. People
called him Devil Menendez. Especially, no woman was safe from him,
and in the old days, when his power had been great, he had used it for
wickedness.
â€œMy father was afraid when he heard he was coming. He would have sent me
away, but before it could be arranged SeÃ±or the Colonel arrived. He had
in his company a French lady. I thought her very beautiful and elegant.
It was Madame de StÃ¤mer. It is only four years ago, a little more, but
her hair was dark brown. She was splendidly dressed and such a wonderful
horsewoman. The first time I saw her I felt as they had made me feel at
the convent. I wanted to hide from her. She was so grand a lady, and I
NA
She paused hesitatingly and stared down at her own tiny feet.
NA
NA
She looked up with her naÃ¯ve smile.
â€œI can tell you, yes. A cousin of SeÃ±or Menendez married a sister of
NA
NA
NA
hands expressively--â€œshe came with him to the West Indies, although it
was during the great war. I think she loved him more than her soul, and
me--me she hated. As SeÃ±or Menendez dismounted from his horse in front

She sighed and ceased speaking again. Then:

shameful name, and my father, who heard it, ordered her out of the

She paused once more, biting her lip agitatedly, but presently
proceeded:
â€œDo you know what they are like, the Spanish, when their blood is hot?
Senor Menendez had a revolver, but my father knocked it from his grasp.
Then they fought with their bare hands. I was too frightened even to cry
out. It was all a horrible dream. What Madame de StÃ¤mer did, I do not
know. I could see nothing but two figures twined together on the floor.
At last one of them arose. I saw it was my father, and I remember no
NA
She was almost overcome by her tragic recollections, but presently, with
a wonderful courage, which, together with her daintiness of form, spoke
eloquently of good blood on one side at any rate, continued to speak:
â€œMy father found he must go to Cuba to make arrangements for the future.
Of course, our life there was finished. Ah Tsong stayed with me. You
have heard how it used to be in those islands in the old days, but now
you think it is so different? I used to think it was different, too. On
the first night my father was away, Ah Tsong, who had gone out, was so
long returning I became afraid. Then a strange negro came with news that
he had been taken ill with cholera, and was lying at a place not far
NA
She laughed wildly.
â€œI did not know I should never return, and I did not know I should never
see my father again. To you this must seem all wild and strange, because
there is a law in England. There is a law in Cuba, too, but in some of

She raised her hands to her face and there was silence for a while.

island called El Manas which belonged to Senor Menendez, and where
NA
proudly--â€œmy spirit he could not break. Lots and lots of money would
be mine, and estates of my own; but one thing about him I must tell: he
never showed me violence. For one, two, three weeks I stayed a prisoner
in his house. All the servants were faithful to him and I could not
find a friend among them. Although quite innocent, I was ruined. Do you

She raised her eyes pathetically to Val Beverley.
â€œI thought my heart was broken, for something told me my father was

NA

his way to Havana. They said it was an accident. Well--at last, SeÃ±or
Menendez offered me marriage. I thought if I agreed it would give me my

She paused, and a flush coloured her delicate face and faded again,
leaving it very pale.
NA
hands pathetically--â€œdo you know what a woman is like? My spirit was not
broken still, but crushed. I had now nothing but kindness and gifts.
NA
sadly--â€œI was beautiful, took me to Cuba, where he had a great house.
NA
was so young and had never known love, except the love of my father. I
did not even dream, then, his death was not an accident.
â€œI was proud of my jewels and fine dresses. But I began to notice that
Juan did not present any of his friends to me. We went about, but to
strange places, never to visit people of his own kind, and none came to
visit us. Then one night I heard someone on the balcony of my room. I
was so frightened I could not cry out. It was good I was like that, for
NA
She clutched convulsively at the arms of her chair.
NA
Then, looking up pitifully:
NA
NA
Her beautiful eyes flashed, and for the first time since I had met Ysola
Camber I saw the real Spanish spirit of the woman leap to life.
â€œHe did not know me. Perhaps I did not know myself. That night, with
no money, without a ring, a piece of lace, a peseta, anything that had
belonged to him, I went with Ah Tsong. We made our way to a half-sister
of my fatherâ€™s who lived in Puerto Principe, and at first--she would not
have me. I was talked about, she said, in all the islands. She told me
of my poor father. She told me I had dragged the name of de Valera in
the dirt. At last I made her understand--that what everyone else had

She looked up wistfully, as if thinking that we might doubt her.
NA
NA
in her voice and in her eyes. â€œIt is very, very brave of you to tell us
NA
NA
it can help Colin?
NA
it was while I was hiding in her house--because spies of Senor Menendez
were searching for me--that I met--my husband. He was studying in Cuba
the strange things he writes about, you see. And before I knew what had
happened--I found I loved him more than all else in the world. It is so
NA
NA
The girl flushed deeply, and lowered her eyes, but made no reply.
NA
resumed. â€œI did not tell him. I did not dare to tell him at first. I
NA
lower and lower--â€œhe asked me to marry him, I told him. Nothing he could
ever do would change my love for him now, because he forgave me and made
NA
I feared that at last she was going to break down, for her voice became
very tremulous and tears leapt again into her eyes. She conquered her
emotion, however, and went on:
â€œWe crossed over to the States, and Colinâ€™s family who had heard of his
marriage--some friend of SeÃ±or Menendez had told them--would not know
us. It meant that Colin, who would have been a rich man, was very poor.
It made no difference. He was splendid. And I was so happy it was all
like a dream. He made me forget I was to blame for his troubles. Then we
were in Washington--and I saw SeÃ±or Menendez in the hotel!
â€œOh, my heart stopped beating. For me it seemed like the end of
everything. I knew, I knew, he was following me. But he had not seen me,
and without telling Colin the reason, I made him leave Washington, He
was glad to go. Wherever we went, in America, they seemed to find out
about my mother. I got to hate them, hate them all. We came to England,
and Colin heard about this house, and we took it.
â€œAt last we were really happy. No one knew us. Because we were strange,
and because of Ah Tsong, they looked at us very funny and kept away, but
NA
She looked up quickly.
â€œHow can I tell you? It must have been by Ah Tsong that he traced me to
Surrey. Some spy had told him there was a Chinaman living here. Oh, I
donâ€™t know how he found out, but when I heard who was coming to Crayâ€™s
Folly I thought I should die.
â€œSomething I must tell you now. When I had told my story to Colin, one
thing I had not told him, because I was afraid what he might do. I had
not told him the name of the man who had caused me to suffer so much. On
the day I first saw SeÃ±or Menendez walking in the garden of Crayâ€™s Folly
I knew I must tell my husband what he had so often asked me to tell
him--the name of the man. I told him--and at first I thought he would go
mad. He began to drink--do you know? It is a failing in his family. But
because I knew--because I knew--I forgave him, and hoped, always hoped,
that he would stop. He promised to do so. He had given up going out each
day to drink, and was working again like he used to work--too hard, too

She stopped speaking, and suddenly, before I could divine her intention,
dropped upon her knees, and raised her clasped hands to me.
NA
O God! I who love him tell you he did not! You think he did. You do--you

NA

She continued to look at me for a while, and then turned to Val
Beverley.
NA
She looked such a child, such a pretty, helpless child, as she knelt
there on the carpet, that I felt a lump rising in my throat.
Val Beverley dropped down impulsively beside her and put her arms around
the slender shoulders.

I turned aside, and walked out across the hall and into the empty study.
CHAPTER XXXII
PAUL HARLEYâ€™S EXPERIMENT
I recognize that whosoever may have taken the trouble to follow my
chronicle thus far will be little disposed to suffer any intrusion of
my personal affairs at such a point. Therefore I shall pass lightly over
the walk back to Crayâ€™s Folly, during which I contrived to learn
much about Val Beverleyâ€™s personal history but little to advance the
investigation which I was there to assist.
As I had surmised, Miss Beverley had been amply provided for by her
father, and was bound to Madame de StÃ¤mer by no other ties than those of
friendship and esteem. Very reluctantly I released her, on our returning
to the house; for she, perforce, hurried off to Madameâ€™s room, leaving
me looking after her in a state of delightful bewilderment, the
significance of which I could not disguise from myself. The absurd
suspicions of Inspector Aylesbury were forgotten; so was the shadow upon
the blind of Colonel Menendezâ€™s study. I only knew that love had come to
me, an unbidden guest, to stay for ever.
Manoel informed me that a number of pressmen, not to be denied, had
taken photographs of the Tudor garden and of the spot where Colonel
Menendez had been found, but Pedro, following my instructions, had
referred them all to Market Hilton.
I was standing in the doorway talking to the man when I heard the
drone of Harleyâ€™s motor in the avenue, and a moment later he and Wessex
stepped out in front of the porch and joined me. I thought that Wessex
looked stern and rather confused, but Harley was quite his old self, his
keen eyes gleaming humorously, and an expression of geniality upon his
tanned features.
NA
NA
NA
Inspector Wessex nodded without speaking, and the three of us mounted
the staircase and entered Paul Harleyâ€™s room. Harley seated himself
upon the bed and began to load his pipe, whilst Wessex, who seemed very
restless, stood staring out of the window. I sat down in the armchair,
and:
NA
NA
Wessex turned, hands clasped behind him, and listened in silence to
an account which I gave of my visit to the Guest House. When I had
finished:
NA
NA
NA
Camberâ€™s story differs from that of Menendez although there are points
of contact. I regret, however, that you were unable to settle the most
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
congratulate you upon a piece of really brilliant reasoning, Knox.
But respecting the most crucial moment of all, we are still without
information, unfortunately. However, whilst the presence or otherwise,
of Mrs. Camber in Crayâ€™s Folly on the night preceding the tragedy may
prove to bear intimately upon the case, an experiment which I propose to
NA
NA
of yours, Mr. Harley, with great interest. To be perfectly honest,
I have no more idea than the man in the moon how you hope to clear
NA
NA
crushing. But you are a man of great experience, Wessex, in criminal
investigations. Tell me honestly, have you ever known a murder case in
NA
NA
NA
NA
some sort of judgment respecting his character. You will admit that he
is a clever man, brilliantly clever. Keep this fact in mind. Remember
his studies, and he does not deny that they have included Voodoo.
Remember his enquiries into the significance of Bat Wing. Remember, as
we now learn definitely from Mrs. Camberâ€™s evidence, that he was in
Cuba at the same time as the late Colonel Menendez, and once, at least,
actually in the same hotel in the United States. Consider the rifle
found under the floor of the hut; and, having weighed all these points
judicially, Wessex, tell me frankly, if in the whole course of your
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
complete, I admit: too complete. There lies the weak spot. But what
I will call the psychological evidence points in a totally different
direction. A man clever enough to have planned this crime, and Camber
undoubtedly is such a man, could not--it is humanly impossible--have
been fool enough, deliberately to lay such a train of damning facts.
Itâ€™s a frame-up, Wessex! I had begun to suspect this even before I
met Camber. Having met him, I knew that I was right. Then came an
inspiration. I saw where there must be a flaw in the plan. It was
NA
NA
truly astounded me.
â€œGeographical is the term, Knox. I admit that the discovery of the rifle
NA
NA
â€œIt was the crowning piece of evidence, Knox, evidence of such fiendish
cleverness on the part of those who had plotted Menendezâ€™s death that I
began to wonder whether after all it would be possible to defeat them. I
realized that Camberâ€™s life hung upon a hair. For the production of that
rifle before a jury of twelve moderately stupid men and true could not
fail to carry enormous weight. Whereas the delicate point upon which
my counter case rested might be more difficult to demonstrate in court.
To-night, however, we shall put it to the test, and there are means, no
doubt, which will occur to me later, of making its significance evident
to one not acquainted with the locality. The press photographs, which I
NA
Bewildered by my friendâ€™s revolutionary ideas, which explained the
hitherto mysterious nature of his enquiries, I scarcely knew what to
say; but:
NA
about it the more it has that look to me, practically speaking, we have
NA
NA
NA
It must be unnecessary for me to speak of the state of suppressed
excitement in which we passed the remainder of that afternoon and
evening. Dr. Rolleston called again to see Madame de StÃ¤mer, and
reported that she was quite calm. In fact, he almost echoed Val
Beverleyâ€™s words spoken earlier in the day.
NA
understand that the dead man was a cousin, but I almost suspect that she
NA
I nodded shortly, admiring his acute intelligence.
NA
NA
NA
NA
A formal dinner was out of the question, of course; indeed, no one
attempted to dress. Val Beverley excused herself, saying that she would
dine in Madameâ€™s room, and Harley, Wessex, and I, partook of wine and
sandwiches in the library.
Inspector Aylesbury arrived about eight oâ€™clock in a mood of repressed
irritation. Pedro showed him in to where the three of us were seated,
and:
NA
up to my eyes in work on the case, I will ask you, Mr. Harley, to carry
NA
NA
to accompany Detective-Inspector Wessex and Mr. Knox to the Guest House
by the high road? Do not needlessly alarm Mrs. Camber. Indeed, I
think you might confine your attention to Mrs. Powis. Merely request
permission to walk down the garden to the hut, and be good enough to
wait there until I join you, which will be in a few minutes after your
NA
Inspector Aylesbury uttered an inarticulate, grunting sound, but I, who
knew Harley so well, could see that he felt himself to be upon the eve
of a signal triumph. What he proposed to do, I had no idea, save that
it was designed to clear Colin Camber. I prayed that it might also clear
his pathetic girl-wife; and in a sort of gloomy silence I set out with
Wessex and Aylesbury, down the drive, past the lodge, which seemed to be
deserted to-night, and along the tree-lined high road, cool and sweet in
the dusk of evening.
Aylesbury was very morose, and Wessex, who had lighted his pipe, did not
seem to be in a talkative mood either. He had the utmost faith in Paul
Harley, but it was evident enough that he was oppressed by the weight of
evidence against Camber. I divined the fact that he was turning over
in his mind the idea of the frame-up, and endeavouring to re-adjust the
established facts in accordance with this new point of view.
We were admitted to the Guest House by Mrs. Powis, a cheery old soul;
one of those born optimists whose special task in life seems to be that
of a friend in need.
As she opened the door, she smiled, shook her head, and raised her
finger to her lips.
NA
She spoke of Mrs. Camber as one refers to a child, and, quite
understanding her anxiety:
NA
â€œWe merely wish to walk down to the bottom of the garden to make a few

NA
entered the hall.
She led us through the rear portion of the house, and past the quarters
of Ah Tsong into that neglected garden which I remembered so well.
NA
NA
Inspector Aylesbury cleared his throat, but Wessex, puffing at his pipe,
made no remark whatever until we were all come to the hut overhanging
the little ravine.
NA
Aylesbury.
Wessex nodded absently.
It was another perfect night, with only a faint tracery of cloud to be
seen like lingering smoke over on the western horizon. Everything seemed
very still, so that although we were several miles from the railway
line, when presently a train sped on its way one might have supposed,
from the apparent nearness of the sound, that the track was no farther
off than the grounds of Crayâ€™s Folly.
Toward those grounds, automatically, our glances were drawn; and we
stood there staring down at the ghostly map of the gardens, and all
wondering, no doubt, what Harley was doing and when he would be joining
us.
Very faintly I could hear the water of the little stream bubbling
beneath us. Then, just as this awkward silence was becoming intolerable,
there came a scraping and scratching from the shadows of the gully, and:
NA
NA
He had come across country, and as I scrambled down the slope to meet
him I could not help wondering with what object he had sent us ahead by
the high road. Presently, when he came clambering up into the garden,
this in a measure was explained, for:
NA
Let me endeavour to make it clear. In order that my test should be
conclusive, and in no way influenced by pre-knowledge of certain
arrangements which I had made, I sent you on ahead of me. Not wishing to
waste time, I followed by the shorter route. And now, gentlemen, let us

NA
NA
to look out of the window of the hut, and down into the Tudor garden of
NA
Wessex, taking his pipe out of his mouth, and staring hard at the
speaker, nodded, entered the hut, and kneeling on the wooden seat,
looked out of the window.
NA
NA
Wessex slid the panes open and stared intently down into the valley.
NA
NA
NA
Inspector Aylesbury stamped noisily across the little hut, and peered
out, briefly.
NA
NA
NA
NA
I followed, filled with astonishment.
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, I can see beyond it. I can even see its shadow lying like a black
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Walking around the hut he found an opening in the hedge, and scrambled
down into the place where rank grass grew and through which he and I
on a previous occasion had made our way to the high road. To-night,
however, he did not turn toward the high road, but proceeded along the
crest of the hill.
I followed him, excited by the novelty of the proceedings. Wessex, very
silent, came behind me, and Inspector Aylesbury, swearing under his
breath, waded through the long grass at the rear.
NA
Harley.
We all paused, looking to the right.
NA
We were agreed that there was not.
NA
onward the formation of the ground prevents our obtaining any other view
of Crayâ€™s Folly or its gardens until we reach the path to the valley,
or turn on to the high road. From a point on the latter the tower may
be seen but that is all. The first part of my experiment is concluded,
NA
Giving us no opportunity for comment, he plunged on in the direction of
the stream, and at a point which I regarded as unnecessarily difficult,
crossed it, to the great discomfiture of the heavy Inspector Aylesbury.
A few minutes later we found ourselves once more in the grounds of
Crayâ€™s Folly.
Harley, evidently with a definite objective in view, led the way up the
terraces, through the rhododendrons, and round the base of the tower. He
crossed to the sunken garden, and at the top of the steps paused.
NA
Even as he spoke, I caught my breath, and I heard Aylesbury utter a sort
of gasping sound.
Beyond the sun-dial and slightly to the left of it, viewed from where we
stood, a faint, elfin light flickered, at a point apparently some four
or five feet above the ground!
NA
NA
He led the way down to the garden and along the path to the sun-dial.
This he passed, pausing immediately in front of the yew tree in which I
knew the bullet to be embedded.
He did not speak, but, extending his finger, pointed.
A piece of candle, some four inches long, was attached by means of a
nail to the bark of the tree, so that its flame burned immediately in
front of the bullet embedded there!
For perhaps ten seconds no one spoke; indeed I think no one moved. Then:

NA
NA
NA
NA
the time that you looked out of the window of the hut. You could not see
it. You could not see it from the crest adjoining the Guest House--the
only other spot in the neighbourhood from which this garden is visible.
Now, since the course of a bullet is more or less straight, and since
the nature of the murdered manâ€™s wound proves that it was not deflected
in any way, I submit that the one embedded in the yew tree before you
could not possibly have been fired from the Guest House! The second part
of my experiment, gentlemen, will be designed to prove from whence it

CHAPTER XXXIII
PAUL HARLEYâ€™S EXPERIMENT CONCLUDED
Up to the very moment that Paul Harley, who had withdrawn, rejoined us
in the garden, Inspector Aylesbury had not grasped the significance of
that candle burning upon the yew tree. He continued to stare at it as
if hypnotized, and when my friend re-appeared, carrying a long ash staff
and a sheet of cardboard, I could have laughed to witness the expression
upon the Inspectorâ€™s face, had I not been too deeply impressed with that
which underlay this strange business.
Wessex, on the other hand, was watching my friend eagerly, as an earnest
student in the class-room might watch a demonstration by some celebrated
lecturer.

Menendez as it lay formed a straight line between the sun-dial and the
hut in the garden of the Guest House. That is to say: a line drawn from
the window of the hut to the sun-dial must have passed through the body.
Very well. Such an imaginary line, if continued _beyond_ the sun-dial,
would have terminated near the base of the _seventh yew_ tree.
Accordingly, I naturally looked for the _bullet_ there. It was not
there. But I found it, as you know, in the ninth tree. Therefore, the
shot could not possibly have been fired from the Guest House, because
the spot in the ninth yew where the bullet had lodged is not visible

He knelt down beside the yew tree, lowering his head so that the
candlelight shone upon the brown, eager face, and looked upward, over
the top of the sun-dial and through the hole in the cardboard.

He walked rapidly out of the garden, and up the steps, whilst we
followed dumb with wonder--or such at any rate was the cause of my own
silence.
In the hall Pedro was standing, a bunch of keys in his hand, and
evidently expecting Harley.
NA
directed.
NA
Doubting, wondering, scarcely knowing whether to be fearful or jubilant,
I followed, along a carpeted corridor, and thence, a heavy, oaken
door being unlocked, across a dusty and deserted apartment apparently
intended for a drawing room. From this, through a second doorway we
were led into a small, square, unfurnished room, which I knew must be
situated in the base of the tower. Yet a third door was unlocked, and:
NA
In Indian file we mounted to the first floor, to find ourselves in a
second, identical room, also stripped of furniture and decorations.
Harley barely glanced out of the northern window, shook his head, and:
NA
Up we went, our footsteps arousing a cloud of dust from the uncarpeted
stairs, and the sound of our movements echoing in hollow fashion around
the deserted rooms.
Gaining the next floor, Harley, unable any longer to conceal his
excitement, ran to the north window, looked out, and:
NA
He turned, his back to the window, and faced us in the dusk of the room.
â€œAssuming the ash stick to represent the upright body of Colonel

head, the hole which I have cut in it corresponds fairly nearly to
the position of his forehead. Further assuming the bullet to have
illustrated Euclidâ€™s definition of a straight line, such a line,
_followed back_ from the yew tree to the spot where the rifle rested,
would pass through the hole in the cardboard! In other words, there is
only one place from which it is possible to see the flame of the candle
_through the hole in the cardboard_: the place where the rifle rested!
Stand here in the left-hand angle of the window and stoop down! Will you

I stepped across the room, bent down, and stared out of the window,
across the Tudor garden. Plainly I could see the sun-dial with the
ash stick planted before it. I could see the piece of cardboard which
surmounted it--and, through the hole cut in the cardboard, I could see
the feeble flame of the candle nailed to the ninth yew tree!
I stood upright, knowing that I had grown pale, and conscious of a moist
sensation upon my forehead.

CHAPTER XXXIV
THE CREEPING SICKNESS
From the ensuing consultation in the library we did not rise until close
upon midnight. To the turbid intelligence of Inspector Aylesbury the
fact by this time had penetrated that Colin Camber was innocent, that
he was the victim of a frame-up, and that Colonel Juan Menendez had been
shot from a window of his own house.
By a process of lucid reasoning which must have convinced a junior
schoolboy, Paul Harley, there in the big library, with its garish
bookcases and its Moorish ornaments, had eliminated every member of the
household from the list of suspects. His concluding words, I remember,
were as follows:
â€œOf the known occupants of Crayâ€™s Folly on the night of the tragedy we
now find ourselves reduced to four, any one of whom, from the point
of view of an impartial critic uninfluenced by personal character,
question, or motive, or any consideration other than that of physical
possibility, might have shot Colonel Menendez. They are, firstly:
Myself.
â€œIn order to believe me guilty, it would be necessary to discount the
evidence of Knox, who saw me on the gravel path below at the time that
the shot was fired from the tower window.
â€œSecondly: Knox; whose guilt, equally, could only be assumed by means of
eliminating _my_ evidence, since I saw him at the window of my room at
the time that the shot was fired.
â€œThirdly: Madame de StÃ¤mer. Regarding this suspect, in the first place
she could not have gained access to the tower room without assistance,
and in the second place she was so passionately devoted to the late
Colonel Menendez that Dr. Rolleston is of opinion that her reason may
remain permanently impaired by the shock of his death. Fourthly and
NA
Over my own feelings, as he had uttered the girlâ€™s name, I must pass in
silence.
â€œMiss Val Beverley is the only one of the four suspects who is not in a
position to establish a sound alibi so far as I can see at the moment;
but in this case entire absence of motive renders the suspicion absurd.
Having dealt with the _known_ occupants, I shall not touch upon the
possibility that some stranger had gained access to the house. This
opens up a province of speculation which we must explore at greater
NA
Thus the gathering had broken up, Inspector Aylesbury returning to
Market Hilton to make his report and to release Colin Camber and Ah
Tsong, and Wessex to seek his quarters at the Lavender Arms.
I remember that having seen them off, Harley and I stood in the hall,
staring at one another in a very odd way, and so we stood when Val
Beverley came quietly from Madame de StÃ¤merâ€™s room and spoke to us.
NA
voice. â€œOh, thank God you have cleared him. But what, in Heavenâ€™s name,

NA

NA

NA
NA
declines to tell me, or to show me what she has written. But there is
quite a little stack of manuscript upon the table beside her bed. Wonâ€™t
NA
I could see that she was more troubled than she cared to confess, and
I wondered if Dr. Rollestonâ€™s unpleasant suspicions might have solid
foundation, and if the loss of her cousin had affected Madame de
StÃ¤merâ€™s brain.
Presently, then, ushered by Val Beverley, I found myself once more in
the violet and silver room in which on that great bed of state Madame
reclined amid silken pillows. Her art never deserted her, not even in
moments of ultimate stress, and that she had prepared herself for this
interview was evident enough.
I had thought previously that one night of horror had added five years
to her apparent age. I thought now that she looked radiantly beautiful.
That expression in her eyes, which I knew I must forevermore associate
with the memory of the dying tigress, had faded entirely. They remained
still, as of old, but to-night they were velvety soft. The lips were
relaxed in a smile of tenderness. I observed, with surprise, that she
wore much jewelery, and upon her white bosom gleamed the famous rope
of pearls which I knew her to treasure above almost anything in her
possession.
Again the fear touched me coldly that much sorrow had made her mad. But
at her very first word of greeting I was immediately reassured.
NA
vibrant voice, â€œyou have great news, they tell me? Mr. Harley, I was
afraid that you had deserted me, sir. If you had done so I should have
been very angry with you. Set the two armchairs here on my right, Val,

Then, as we seated ourselves:

Paul Harley excused himself but I accepted a cigarette which Val
Beverley offered me from a silver box on the table, and presently:
NA

Harley inclined his head gravely, and in that succinct fashion which he
had at command acquainted Madame with the result of his two experiments.
As he completed the account:

Harley and I stared vaguely across at the table. I saw Val Beverley
glancing uneasily in the same direction. Save for the writing materials
and little heap of manuscript, it held only a cup and saucer, a few
sandwiches, and a medicine bottle containing the prescription which Dr.
Rolleston had made up for the invalid.
NA
NA
NA
 she whispered, and reaching over she laid her jewelled hand upon my arm,
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œAh, yes, although _I_ told the fat Inspector it was not so. How we lie,
we women! And of course she told you in what relation I stood to Juan

NA
â€œNo-no? Well, it was nice of her. No matter. _I_ will tell you. I was

She spoke without bravado, but quite without shame, seeming to glory in
the statement.

staying at the house of my sister, and my sister, you understand, was
married to Juanâ€™s cousin. That is how we met. I was married. Yes, it is
true. But in France our parents find our husbands and our lovers find
our hearts. Yet sometimes these marriages are happy. To me this good
thing had not happened, and in the moment when Juanâ€™s hand touched mine
a living fire entered into my heart and it has been burning ever since;
burning-burning, always till I die.
â€œVery well, I am a shameless woman, yes. But I have lived, and I have
loved, and I am content. I went with him to Cuba, and from Cuba to
another island where he had estates, and the name of which I shall not
pronounce, because it hurts me so, even yet. There he set eyes upon

She shrugged and snapped her fingers.
â€œHe was like that, you understand? I knew it well. They did not call
him Devil Menendez for nothing. There was a scene, a dreadful scene, and
after that another, and yet a third. I have pride. If I had seemed to
forget it, still it was there. I left him, and went back to France. I
tried to forget. I entered upon works of charity for the soldiers at a
time when others were becoming tired. I spent a great part of my fortune

goes farther than in England. I had had my fun. They called me â€˜good
comrade!â€™ Perhaps I paid with a kiss. What does it matter? But they
heard of me, those Prussian dogs. They knew and could not forgive. How

NA
NA
NA
She clenched her hands and closed her eyes entirely, but presently
resumed again:
â€œIf they had killed me I should have been glad, but they only made of
me a cripple. M. de StÃ¤mer had been killed a few weeks before this. I
am sorry I forgot to mention it. I was a widow. And when after this
catastrophe I could be moved, I went to a little villa belonging to my
husband at Nice, to gain strength, and this child came with me, like a
ray of sunshine.
â€œHere, to wake the fire in my heart, came Juan, deserted, broken,
wounded in soul, but most of all in pride, in that evil pride which
belongs to his race, which is so different from the pride of France, but
for which all the same I could never hate him.
â€œYsola de Valera had run away from his great house in Cuba. Yes! A woman
had dared to leave him, the man who had left so many women. To me it was
pathetic. I was sorry for him. He had been searching the world for her.
He loved this little golden-haired girl as he had never loved me. But
NA
NA
not a woman who is lightly forgotten. But the great passion that burned
in his Spanish soul was revenge.
â€œHe was a broken man not only in mind, but in body. Let me tell you. In
that island which I have not named there is a horrible disease called
by the natives the Creeping Sickness. It is supposed to come from a
poisonous place named the Black Belt, and a part of this Black Belt is

Paul Harley started and glanced at me significantly.
â€œThey think, those simple negroes, that it is witchcraft, Voodoo, the
work of the Obeah man. It is of two kinds, rapid and slow. Those who
suffer from the first kind just decline and decline and die in great
agony. Others recover, or seem to do so. It is, I suppose, a matter of
constitution. Juan had had this sickness and had recovered, or so the

She lay back, shaking her finger characteristically.
â€œIn one year, in two, three, a swift pain comes, like a needle,
you understand? Perhaps in the foot, in the hand, in the arm. It is
exquisite, deathly, while it lasts, but it only lasts for a few moments.
It is agony. And then it goes, leaving nothing to show what has caused
it. But, my friends, it is a death warning!

voice dramatically--â€œthe nearer it is to the heart, the less are the

She paused as if exhausted, closing her eyes again, whilst we three
who listened looked at one another in an awestricken silence, until the
vibrant voice resumed:
â€œThere is only one man in Europe who understands this thing, this
Creeping Sickness. He is a Frenchman who lives in Paris. To him Juan had
been, and he had told him, this clever man, â€˜If you are very quiet and
do not exert yourself, and only take as much exercise as is necessary
NA
NA
â€œYes, such was the verdict. And there is no cure. The poor sufferer must
wait and wait, always wait, for that sudden pang, not knowing if it will
come in his heart and be the finish. Yes. This living death, then, and
revenge, were the things ruling Juanâ€™s life at the time of which I tell
you. He had traced Ysola de Valera to England. A chance remark in a
London hotel had told him that a Chinaman had been seen in a Surrey
village and of course had caused much silly chatter. He enquired at
once, and he found out that Colin Camber, the man who had taken Ysola
from him, was living with her at the Guest House, here, on the hill. How

genius. And I have the strength to tell you because I am happy to-night.
Because of his great wealth Juan succeeded in buying Crayâ€™s Folly from
Sir James Appleton to whom it belonged. He told everybody he leased it,
but really he bought it. He paid him more than twice its value, and so
obtained possession.
â€œBut the plan was not yet complete, although it had taken form in
that clever, wicked brain of his. Oh! I could tell you stories of the
Menendez, and of the things they have done for love and revenge, which
even you, who know much of life, would doubt, I think. Yes, you would
not believe. But to continue. Shall I tell you upon what terms he had
returned to me, eh? I will. Once more he would suffer that pang of death
in life, for he had courage, ah! such great courage, and then, when the
waiting for the next grew more than even his fearless heart could bear,

have asked from one who loved me. But to die, knowing another cherished
the woman who had been torn from him, was an impossibility for
Juan Menendez. What he had schemed to do at first I never knew. But
presently, because of our situation here, and because of that which he
had asked of me, it came, the great plan.
â€œOn the night he told me, a night I shall never forget, I drew back in
horror from him--I, Marie de StÃ¤mer, who thought I knew the blackest
that was in him. I shrank. And because of that scene it came to him
again in the early morning--the moment of agony, the needle pain, here,
low down in his left breast.
â€œHe pleaded with me to do the wicked thing that he had planned,
and because I dared not refuse, knowing he might die at my feet, I
consented. But, my friends, I had my own plan, too, of which he knew
nothing. On the next day he went to Paris, and was told he had two
months to live, with great, such great care, but perhaps only a week,
a day, if he should permit his hot passions to inflame that threatened
heart. Very well.
â€œI said yes, yes, to all that he suggested, and he began to lay the
trail--the trail to lead to his enemy. It was his hobby, this vengeance.
He was like a big, cruel boy. It was he, himself, Juan Menendez, who
broke into Crayâ€™s Folly. It was he who nailed the bat wing to the door.
It was he who bought two rifles of a kind of which so many millions were
made during the war that anybody might possess one. And it was he who
concealed the first of these, one cartridge discharged, under the floor
of the hut in the garden of the Guest House. The other, which was to be

ready, ready for revenge and ready for death. He summoned you, M.
Harley, to be an expert witness. He placed with you evidence which could
not fail to lead to the arrest of M. Camber. Very well. I allowed him to
do all this. His courage, _mon Dieu_, how I worshipped his courage!
â€œAt night, when everyone slept, and he could drop the mask, I have seen
what he suffered. I have begged him, begged him upon my knees, to allow
me to end it then and there; to forget his dream of revenge, to die
without this last stain upon his soul. But he, expecting at any hour, at
any minute, to know again the agony which cannot be described, which is

raised her eyes ecstatically--â€œI have worshipped this courage of his,
although it was evil--bad.
â€œThe full moon gives the best light, and so he planned it for the night
of the full moon. But on the night before, because of some scene which
he had with you, M. Harley, nearly I thought his plans would come to
nothing. Nearly I thought the last act of love which he asked of me
would never be performed. He sat there, up in the little room which he
liked best, the coldness upon him which always came before the pang,
waiting, waiting, a deathly dew on his forehead, for the end; and I, I
who loved him better than life, watched him. And, so Fate willed it, the

defiantly at Paul Harley. â€œLast night, you, M. Harley, who have genius,
nearly brought it all to nothing. You passed the door in the shrubbery
just when Juan was preparing to go out. I was watching from the window
above. Then, when you had gone, he came out--smoking his last cigarette.
â€œI went to my place, entering the tower room by the door from that
corridor. I opened the window. It had been carefully oiled. It was
soundless. I was cold as one already dead, but love made me strong. I
had seen him suffer. I took the rifle from its hiding-place, the heavy
rifle which so few women could use. It was no heavier than some which I

Again she paused, and I saw her lips trembling. Before my mindâ€™s eye
the picture arose which I had seen from Harleyâ€™s window, the picture
of Colonel Juan Menendez walking in the moonlight along the path to
the sun-dial, with halting steps, with clenched fists, but upright as a
soldier on parade. Walking on, dauntlessly, to his execution. Out of a
sort of haze, which seemed to obscure both sight and hearing, I heard
Madame speaking again.
â€œHe turned his head toward me. He threw me a kiss--and I fired. Did you
think a woman lived who could perform such a deed, eh? If you did not
think so, it is because you have never looked into the eyes of one who
loved with her body, her mind, and with her soul. I think, yes, I think
I went mad. The rifle I remember I replaced. But I remember no more.

Her face was radiant. It became lighted up magically. I knew in that
grim hour what a beautiful woman Madame de StÃ¤mer must have been. She

She closed her eyes and dropped back upon her pillows for the last time.
CHAPTER XXXV
AN AFTERWORD
This shall be a brief afterword, for I have little else to say. As
Madame had predicted, all antidotes and restoratives were of no avail.
She had taken enough of some drug which she had evidently had in her
possession for this very purpose to ensure that there should be no
awakening, and although Dr. Rolleston was on the spot within half an
hour, Madame de StÃ¤mer was already past human aid.
There are perhaps one or two details which may be of interest. For
instance, as a result of the post-mortem examination of Colonel
Menendez, no trace of disease was discovered in any of the organs, but
from information supplied by his solicitors, Harley succeeded in tracing
the Paris specialist to whom Madame de StÃ¤mer had referred; and he
confirmed her statement in every particular. The disease, to which he
gave some name which I have forgotten, was untraceable, he declared, by
any means thus far known to science.
As we had anticipated, the bulk of Colonel Don Juanâ€™s wealth he had
bequeathed to Madame de StÃ¤mer, and she in turn had provided that all
of which she might die possessed should be divided between certain
charities and Val Beverley.
I thus found myself at the time when all these legal processes
terminated engaged to marry a girl as wealthy as she was beautiful.
Therefore, except for the many grim memories which it had left with me,
nothing but personal good fortune resulted from my sojourn at Crayâ€™s
Folly, beneath the shadow of that Bat Wing which had had no existence
outside the cunning imagination of Colonel Juan Menendez.
