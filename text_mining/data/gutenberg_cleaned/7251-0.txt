SWEET CICELY
CHAPTER I.
It was somewhere about the middle of winter, along in the forenoon, that
Josiah Allen was telegrafted to, unexpected. His niece Cicely and her
little boy was goinâ€™ to pass through Jonesville the next day on her way
to visit her aunt Mary (aunt on her motherâ€™s side), and she would stop
off, and make us a short visit if convenient.
We wuz both tickled, highly tickled; and Josiah, before he had read the
telegraf ten minutes, was out killinâ€™ a hen. The plumpest one in the
flock was the order I give; and I wus a beginninâ€™ to make a fuss, and
cook up for her.
We loved her jest about as well as we did Tirzah Ann. Sweet Cicely was
what we used to call her when she was a girl. Sweet Cicely is a plant
that has a pretty white posy. And our niece Cicely was prettier and
purer and sweeter than any posy that ever grew: so we thought then, and
so we think still.
[Illustration: JOSIAH TELLING THE NEWS TO SAMANTHA.]
Her mother was my companionâ€™s sister,--one of a pair of twins, Mary and
Maria, that thought the world of each other, as twins will. Their mother
died when they wus both of â€˜em babies; and they wus adopted by a rich
aunt, who brought â€˜em up elegant, and likely too: that I will say for
her, if she wus a â€˜Piscopal, and I a Methodist. I am both liberal and
truthful--very.
Maria wus Cicelyâ€™s ma, and she wus left a widow when she wus a young
woman; and Cicely wus her only child. And the two wus bound up in each
other as I never see a mother and daughter in my life before or sense.
The third year after Josiah and me wus married, Maria wusnâ€™t well, and
the doctor ordered her out into the country for her health; and she and
little Cicely spent the hull of that summer with us. Cicely wus about
ten; and how we did love that girl! Her mother couldnâ€™t bear to have her
out of her sight; and I declare, we all of us wus jest about as bad.
And from that time they used to spend most all of their summers in
Jonesville. The air agreed with â€˜em, and so did I: we never had a word
of trouble. And we used to visit them quite a good deal in the winter
season: they lived in the city.
Wall, as Cicely got to be a young girl, I used often to set and look at
her, and wonder if the Lord could have made a prettier, sweeter girl
if he had tried to. She looked to me jest perfect, and so she did to
Josiah.
And she knew so much, too, and wus so womanly and quiet and deep. I
sâ€™pose it wus beinâ€™ always with her mother that made her seem older and
more thoughtful than girls usially are. It seemed as if her great dark
eyes wus full of wisdom beyend--fur beyend--her years, and sweetness
too. Never wus there any sweeter eyes under the heavens than those of
our niece Cicely.
She wus very fair and pale, you would think at first; but, when you
would come to look closer, you would see there was nothing sickly in
her complexion, only it was very white and smooth,--a good deal like
the pure white leaves of the posy Sweet Cicely. She had a gentle, tender
mouth, rose-pink; and her cheeks wuz, when she would get rousted up and
excited about any thing; and then it would all sort oâ€™ die out again
into that pure white. And over all her face, as sweet and womanly as it
was, there was a look of power, somehow, a look of strength, as if she
would venture much, dare much, for them she loved. She had the gift, not
always a happy one, of loving,--a strength of devotion that always has
for its companion-trait a gift of endurance, of martyrdom if necessary.
She would give all, dare all, endure all, for them she loved. You could
see that in her face before you had been with her long enough to see it
in her life.
Her hair wus a soft, pretty brown, about the color of her eyes. And
she wus a little body, slender, and sort oâ€™ plump too; and her arms and
hands and neck wus soft and white as snow almost.
Yes, we loved Cicely: and no one could blame us, or wonder at us for
callinâ€™ her after the posy Sweet Cicely; for she wus prettier than any
posy that ever blew, enough sight.
Wall, she had always said she couldnâ€™t live if her mother died.
But she did, poor little creeter! she did.
Maria died when Cicely wus about eighteen. She had always been delicate,
and couldnâ€™t live no longer: so she died. And Josiah and me went right
after the poor child, and brought her home with us.
[Illustration: CICELY.]
She lived, Cicely did, because she wus young, and couldnâ€™t die. And
Josiah and me wus dretful good to her; and manyâ€™s the nights that I
have gone into her room when Iâ€™d hear her cryinâ€™ way along in the night;
manyâ€™s the times I have gone in, and took her in my arms, and held her
there, and cried with her, and soothed her, and got her to sleep, and
held her in my arms like a baby till morninâ€™. Wall, she lived with us
most a year that time; and it wus about two years after, while she wus
to some of her fatherâ€™s folksâ€™es (they wus very rich), that she met the
young man she married,--Paul Slide.
He wus a handsome young man, well-behaved, only he would drink a little
once in a while: heâ€™d got into the habit at college, where his mate wus
wild, and had his turns. But he wus very pretty in his manners, Paul
was,--polite, good-natured, generous-dispositioned,--and very rich.
And as to his looks, there wuznâ€™t no earthly fault to find with him,
only jest his chin. And I told Josiah, that how Cicely could marry a man
with such a chin wus a mystery to me.
NA
And I says, â€œWhy, it jest sets right back from his mouth: he hainâ€™t got
NA
nothinâ€™ but a holler place all filled up with irresolution and weakness.
NA
And then--I well remember it, for it was the very first time
after marriage, and so, of course, the very first time in our two
NA
called me so. He says, â€œI wouldnâ€™t be a dumb fool if I was in your
NA
I felt worked up. But, like warriors on a battle-field, I grew stronger
for the fray; and the fray didnâ€™t scare me none.
[Illustration: PAUL SLIDE.]
NA
But, as I said, I didnâ€™t see how Cicely ever fell in love with a man
with such a chin. But, as I learned afterwards, she fell in love with
him under a fur collar. It wus on a slay-ride. And he wuz very handsome
from his mouth up, very: his mouth wuz ruther weak. It wus a case of
love at first sight, which I believe in considerable; and she couldnâ€™t
help lovinâ€™ him, women are so queer.
I had always said that when Cicely did love, it would go hard with her.
Manyâ€™s the offers sheâ€™d had, but didnâ€™t care for â€˜em. But I knew, with
her temperament and nater, that love, if it did come to her, would come
to stay, and it would come hard and voyalent. And so it did.
She worshipped him, as I said at first, under a fur collar. And then,
when a woman once gets to lovinâ€™ a man as she did, why, she canâ€™t help
herself, chin or no chin. When a woman has once throwed herself in front
of her idol, it hainâ€™t so much matter whether it is stuffed full of
gold, or holler: it hainâ€™t so much matter _what_ they be, I think.
Curius, hainâ€™t it?
It hainâ€™t the easiest thing in the world for such a woman as Cicely to
love, but it is a good deal easier for her than to unlove, as she found
out afterwards. For twice before her marriage she saw him out of his
head with liquor; and it wus my advice to her, to give him up.
And she tried to unlove him, tried to give him up.
But, good land! she might jest as well have took a piece of her own
heart out, as to take out of it her love for him: it had become a part
of her. And he told her she could save him, her influence could redeem
him, and it wus the only thing that could save him.
And Cicely couldnâ€™t stand such talk, of course; and she believed
him--believed that she could love him so well, throw her influence so
around him, as to hold him back from any evil course.
It is a beautiful hope, the very beautifulest and divinest piece of
folly a woman can commit. Beautiful enough in the sublime martyrdom of
the idee, to make angels smile; and vain enough, and foolish enough in
its utter uselessness, to make sinners weep. It canâ€™t be done--not in 98
cases out of a 100 at least.
Why, if a man hainâ€™t got love enough for a woman when he is tryinâ€™ to
win her affection,--when he is on probation, as you may say,--to stop
and turn round in his downward course, how can she expect he will after
he has got her, and has let down his watch, so to speak?
But she loved him. And when I warned her with tears in my eyes, warned
her that mebby it wus more than her own safety and happiness that wus
imperilled, I could see by the look in her eyes, though she didnâ€™t
say much, that it wusnâ€™t no use for me to talk; for she wus one of
the constant natures that canâ€™t wobble round. And though I donâ€™t like
wobblinâ€™, still I do honestly believe that the wobblers are happier than
them that canâ€™t wobble.
I could see jest how it wuz, and I couldnâ€™t bear to have her blamed. And
I would tell folks,--some of the relations on her motherâ€™s side,--when
NA
â€œWall, when a woman sees the man she loves goinâ€™ down to ruination,
and tries to unlove him, sheâ€™ll find out jest how much harder it is to
unlove him than to love him in the first place: theyâ€™ll find out it is a
NA
NA
I said this to blamers of Cicely (relatives, the best blamers you can
find anywhere). But, at the same time, it would have been my way, when
he had come a courtinâ€™ me so far gone with liquor that he could hardly
stand up--why, I should have told him plain, that I wouldnâ€™t try to set
myself up as a rival to alcohol, and he might pay to that his attentions
exclusively hereafter.
But she didnâ€™t. And he promised sacred to abstain, and could, and did,
for most a year; and she married him.
But, jest before the marriage, I got so rousted up a thinkinâ€™ about what
I had heard of him at college,--and I studied on his picture, which she
had sent me, took sideways too, and I could see plain (why, he hadnâ€™t no
chin at all, as you may say; and his lips was weak and waverinâ€™ as
ever lips was, though sort oâ€™ amiable and fascinating),--and I got to
forebodinâ€™ so about that chin, and my love for her wus a hunchinâ€™ me up
so all the time, that I went to see her on a short tower, to beset her
on the subject. But, good land! I might have saved my breath, I might
have saved my tower.
I cried, and she cried too. And I says to her before I thought,--
NA
And she says, â€œI would rather be beaten by his hand, than to be crowned
NA
You see, that meant a awful sight to her. And as she looked at me so
earnest and solemn, with tears in them pretty brown eyes, there wus in
her look all that that word could possibly mean to any soul.
But I cried into my white linen handkerchief, and couldnâ€™t help it, and
couldnâ€™t help sayinâ€™, as I see that look,--
NA
â€œWhy, I am not afraid to die when I am with him. I am afraid of
NA
Well, I see my talk was no use. I see sheâ€™d have him, chin or no chin.
If I could have taken her up in my arms, and run away with her then and
there, how much misery I could have saved her from! But I couldnâ€™t: I
had the rheumatiz. And I had to give up, and go home disappointed, but
carryinâ€™ this thought home with me on my tower,--that I had done my duty
by our sweet Cicely, and could do no more.
As I said, he promised firm to give up drinking. But, good land! what
could you expect from that chin? That chin couldnâ€™t stand temptation if
it came in his way. At the same time, his love for Cicely was such, and
his good heart and his natural gentlemanly intuitions was such, that, if
he could have been kepâ€™ out of the way of temptation, he would have been
all right.
If there hadnâ€™t been drinking-saloons right in front of that chin, if
it could have walked along the road without runninâ€™ right into â€˜em,
it would have got along. That chin, and them waverinâ€™-lookinâ€™, amiable
lips, wouldnâ€™t have stirred a step out of their ways to get ruined and
disgraced: they wouldnâ€™t have took the trouble to.
And for a year or so he and the chin kepâ€™ out of the way of
temptation, or ruther temptation kepâ€™ out of their way; and Cicely was
happy,--radiently happy, as only such a nature as hern can be. Her face
looked like a morninâ€™ in June, it wus so bright, and glowing with joy
and happy love.
I visited her, stayed 3 days and 2 nights with her; and I almost forgot
to forebode about the lower part of his face, I found â€˜em so happy and
prosperous and likely.
Paul wus very rich. He wus the only child: and his pa left 2 thirds of
his property to him, and the other third to his ma, which wus more than
she could ever use while she wus alive; and at her death it wus to go to
Paul and his heirs.
They owned most all of the village they lived in. His pa had owned the
township the village was built on, and had built most all the village
himself, and rented the buildings. He owned a big manufactory there, and
the buildings rented high.
Wall, it wus in the second year of their marriage that that old college
chumb--(and I wish he had been chumbed by a pole, before he had ever
gone there). He had lost his property, and come down in the world,
and had to work for a livinâ€™; moved into that village, and opened a
drinking-saloon and billiard-room.
He had been Paulâ€™s most intimate friend at college, and his evil
genius, so his mother said. But he was bright, witty, generous in a way,
unprincipled, dissipated. And he wanted Paulâ€™s company, and he wanted
Paulâ€™s money; and he had a chin himself, and knew how to manage them
that hadnâ€™t any.
Wall, Cicely and his mother tried to keep Paul from that bad influence.
But he said it would look shabby to not take any notice of a man because
he wus down in the world. He wouldnâ€™t have much to do with him, but it
wouldnâ€™t do to not notice him at all. How curius, that out of good comes
bad, and out of bad, good. That was a good-natured idee of Paulâ€™s if he
had had a chin that could have held up his principle; but he didnâ€™t.
So he gradually fell under the old influence again. He didnâ€™t mean to.
He hadnâ€™t no idee of doinâ€™ so when he begun. It was the chin.
He begun to drink hard, spent his nights in the saloon,
gambled,--slipped right down the old, smooth track worn by millions of
jest such weak feet, towards ruin. And Cicely couldnâ€™t hold him back
after he had got to slippinâ€™: her arms wuznâ€™t strong enough.
She went to the saloon-keeper, and cried, and begged of him not to sell
her husband any more liquor. He was very polite to her, very courteous:
everybody was to Cicely. But in a polite way he told her that Paul wus
his best customer, and he shouldnâ€™t offend him by refusing to sell him
liquor. She knelt at his feet, I hearn,--her little, tender limbs on
that rough floor before that evil man,--and wept, and said,--
NA
But in a gentle way he gave her to understand that he shouldnâ€™t make no
change.
And he told her, speakinâ€™ in a dretful courteous way, â€œthat he had the
law on his side: he had a license, and he should keep right on as he was
NA
[Illustration: CICELY IN THE SALOON.]
And so what could Cicely do? And time went on, carryinâ€™ Paul further and
further down the road that has but one ending. Lower and lower he sunk,
carryinâ€™ her heart, her happiness, her life, down with him.
And they said one cold night Paul didnâ€™t come home at all, and Cicely
and his mother wus half crazy; and they wus too proud, to the last, to
tell the servants more than they could help: so, when it got to be most
morninâ€™, them two delicate women started out through the deep snow, to
try to find him, tremblinâ€™ at every little heap of snow that wus tumbled
up in the path in front of â€˜em; tremblinâ€™ and sick at heart with the
agony and dread that wus rackinâ€™ their souls, as they would look
over the cold fields of snow stretching on each side of the road, and
thinkinâ€™ how that face would look if it wus lying there staring with
lifeless eyes up towards the cold moonlight,--the face they had kissed,
the face they had loved,--and thinkinâ€™, too, that the change that had
come to it--was cominâ€™ to it all the time--was more cruel and hopeless
than the change of death.
So they went on, clear to the saloon; and there they found him,--there
he lay, perfectly stupid, and dead with liquor.
And they both, the broken-hearted mother and the broken-hearted
wife, with the tears running down their white cheeks, besought the
saloon-keeper to let him alone from that night.
The mother says, â€œPaul is so good, that if you did not tempt him, entice
NA
And the saloon-keeper was jest as polite as any man wus ever seen to
be,--took his hat off while he told â€˜em, so I hearn, â€œthat he couldnâ€™t
go against his own interests: if Paul chose to spend his money there, he

NA
big, sorrowful eyes lookinâ€™ right through his soul--if he _had_ a soul.
And then the man, in a pleasant tone, reminded â€˜em,--
â€œThat it wuznâ€™t him that wus a doinâ€™ this. It wus the law: if they
wanted things changed, they must look further than him. He had a
license. The great Government of the United States had sold him, for a
few dollars, the right to do just what he was doing. The law, and all
the respectability that the laws of our great and glorious Republic can
give, bore him out in all his acts. The law was responsible for all
the consequenses of his acts: the men were responsible who voted for
NA
â€œBut you _can_ do what we ask if you will, out of pity to Paul, pity to
us who love him so, and who are forced to stand by powerless, and see
him going to ruin--we who would die for him willingly if it would do any
NA
He was a little bit intoxicated, or he wouldnâ€™t have gid â€˜em the cruel
sneer he did at the last,--though he sneeren polite,--a holdinâ€™ his hat
in his hand.
â€œAs I said, my dear madam, it is not I, it is the law; and I see no
other way for you ladies who feel so about it, only to vote, and change
NA
NA
solemn eyes lifted to the heavens, in which was her only hope.
NA
on the face of him who had promised to cherish her, and comfort her,
and protect her, layinâ€™ there at her feet, a mark for jeers and sneers,
unable to speak a word, or lift his hand, if his wife and mother had
been killed before him.
But they couldnâ€™t do any thing. They would have lain their lives down
for him at any time, but that wouldnâ€™t do any good. The lowest, most
ignorant laborer in their employ had power in this matter, but they had
none. They had intellectual power enough, which, added to their
utter helplessness, only made their burden more unendurable; for they
comprehended to the full the knowledge of what was past, and what must
come in the future unless help came quickly. They had the strength of
devotion, the strength of unselfish love.
They had the will, but they hadnâ€™t nothinâ€™ to tackle it onto him with,
to draw him back. For their prayers, their midnight watches, their
tears, did not avail, as I said: they went jest so far; they touched
him, but they lacked the tacklinâ€™-power that was wanted to grip holt of
him, and draw him back. What they needed was the justice of the law to
tackle the injustice; and they hadnâ€™t got it, and couldnâ€™t get holt of
it: so they had to set with hands folded, or lifted to the heavens in
wild appeal,--either way didnâ€™t help Paul any,--and see him a sinkinâ€™
and a sinkinâ€™, slippinâ€™ further and further down; and they had to let
him go.
He drunk harder and harder, neglected his business, got quarrelsome. And
one night, when the heavens was curtained with blackness, like a pall
let down to cover the accursed scene, he left Cicely with her pretty
baby asleep on her bosom, went down to the saloon, got into a quarrel
with that very friend of hisen, the saloon-keeper, over a game of
billiards,--they was both intoxicated,--and then and there Paul
committed _murder_, and would have been hung for it if he hadnâ€™t died in
Stateâ€™s prison the night before he got his sentence.
[Illustration: PAUL SHOOTING HIS FRIEND.]
Awful deed! Dreadful fate! But no worse, as I told Josiah when he wus a
groaninâ€™ over it; no worse, I told the children when they was a cryinâ€™
over it; no worse, I told my own heart when the tears wus a runninâ€™ down
my face like rain-water,--no worse because Cicely happened to be our
relation, and we loved her as we did our own eyes.
And our broad land is _full_ of jest such sufferinâ€™s, jest such crimes,
jest such disgrace, caused by the same cause;--as I told Josiah,
suffering, disgrace, and crime made legal and protected by the law.
And Josiah squirmed as I said it; and I see him squirm, for he believed
in it: he believed in licensing this shame and disgrace and woe; he
believed in makinâ€™ it respectable, and wrappinâ€™ round it the mantilly of
the law, to keep it in a warm, healthy, flourishinâ€™ condition. Why, he
had helped do it himself; he had helped the United States lift up the
mantilly; he had voted for it.
He squirmed, but turned it off by usinâ€™ his bandana hard, and sayinâ€™, in
a voice all choked down with grief,--
NA
NA
girlâ€™--has killed her; for she wonâ€™t live through it, and you and the
NA
He squirmed hard; and my feelinâ€™s for him are such that I canâ€™t bear
to see him squirm voyalently, as much as I blamed him and the United
States, and as mad as I was at both on â€˜em.
So I went to cryinâ€™ agin silently under my linen handkerchief, and he
cried into his bandana. It wus a awful blow to both on us.
Wall, she lived, Cicely did, which was more than we any one of us
thought she could do. I went right there, and stayed six weeks with her,
hanginâ€™ right over her bed, night and day; and so did his mother,--she a
brokenhearted woman too. Her heart broke, too, by the United States; and
so I told Josiah, that little villain that got killed was only one of
his agents. Yes, her heart was broke; but she bore up for Cicelyâ€™s sake
and the boyâ€™s. For it seemed as if she felt remorsful, and as if it was
for them that belonged to him who had ruined her life, to help her all
they could.
Wall, after about three weeks Cicely begun to live. And so I wrote to
Josiah that I guessed she would keep on a livinâ€™ now, for the sake of
the boy.
And so she did. And she got up from that bed a shadow,--a faint, pale
shadow of the girl that used to brighten up our home for us. She was our
sweet Cicely still. But she looked like that posy after the frost has
withered it, and with the cold moonlight layinâ€™ on it.
Good and patient she wuz, and easy to get along with; for she seemed to
hold earthly things with a dretful loose grip, easy to leggo of â€˜em. And
it didnâ€™t seem as if she had any interest at all in life, or care for
any thing that was a goinâ€™ on in the world, till the boy wus about four
years old; and then she begun to get all rousted up about him and
NA
NA
[Illustration: CICELY AND THE BOY.]
NA
hard for boys, where temptations and danger stood all round her boyâ€™s
pathway. Not only hidden perils, concealed from sight, so he might
possibly escape them, but open temptations, open dangers, made as
alluring as private avarice could make them, and made as respectable as
dignified legal enactments could make them,--all to draw her boy down
NA
about Cicely wuz, she didnâ€™t seem to blame Paul hardly a mite, nor not
so very much the one that enticed him to drink. She went back further
than them: she laid the blame onto our laws; she laid the responsibility
onto the ones that made â€˜em, directly and indirectly, the legislators
and the voters.
Curius that Cicely should feel so, when most everybody said that he
could have stopped drinking if he had wanted to. But then, I donâ€™t know
as I could blame her for feelinâ€™ so when I thought of Paulâ€™s chin and
lips. Why, anybody that had them on â€˜em, and was made up inside and
outside accordinâ€™, as folks be that have them looks; why, unless they
was specially guarded by good influences, and fenced off from bad
ones,--why, they _could not_ exert any self-denial and control and
firmness.
Why, I jest followed that chin and that mouth right back through seven
generations of the Slide family. Paulâ€™s father wus a good man, had a
good face; took it from his mother: but his father, Paulâ€™s grandfather,
died a drunkard. They have got a oil-portrait of him at Paulâ€™s old home:
I stopped there on my way home from Cicelyâ€™s one time. And for all the
world he looked most exactly like Paul,--the same sort of a irresolute,
handsome, weak, fascinating look to him. And all through them portraits
I could trace that chin and them lips. They would disappear in some of
â€˜em, but crop out agin further back. And I asked the housekeeper, who
had always lived in the family, and wus proud of it, but honest; and she
knew the story of the hull Slide race.
And she said that every one of â€˜em that had that face had traits
accordinâ€™; and most every one of â€˜em got into trouble of some kind.
One or two of â€˜em, specially guarded, I sâ€™pose, by good influences, got
along with no further trouble than the loss of the chin, and the feelinâ€™
they must have had inside of â€˜em, that they wuz liable to crumple right
down any minute.
And as they wus made with jest them looks, and jest them traits, born
so, entirely unbeknown to them, I donâ€™t know as I can blame Cicely for
feelinâ€™ as she did. If temptation hadnâ€™t stood right in the road in
front of him, why, heâ€™d have got along, and lived happy. Thatâ€™s Cicelyâ€™s
idee. And I donâ€™t know but sheâ€™s in the right ont.
But as I said, when her child wus about four years old, Cicely took a
turn, and begun to get all worked up and excited by turns a worryinâ€™
about the boy. Sheâ€™d talk about it a sight to me, and I hearn it from
others.
She rousted up out of her deathly weakness and heartbroken, stunted
calm,--for such it seemed to be for the first two or three years after
her husbandâ€™s death. She seemed to make an effort almost like that of a
dead man throwinâ€™ off the icy stupor of death, and risinâ€™ up with numbed
limbs, and shakinâ€™ off the death-robes, and livinâ€™ agin. She rousted up
with jest such a effort, so it seemed, for the boyâ€™s sake.
She must live for the boy; she must work for the boy; she must try to
throw some safeguards around his future. What _could_ she do to help
him? That wus the question that was a hantinâ€™ her soul.
It wus jest like death for her to face the curius gaze of the world
again; for, like a wounded animal, she had wanted to crawl away, and
hide her cruel woe and disgrace in some sheltered spot, away from the
sharp-sot eyes of the babblinâ€™ world.
But she endured it. She came out of her quiet home, where her heart had
bled in secret; she came out into society again; and she did every
thing she could, in her gentle, quiet way. She joined temperance
societies,--helped push â€˜em forward with her money and her influence.
With other white-souled wimmen, gentle and refined as she was, she went
into rough bar-rooms, and knelt on their floors, and prayed what her sad
heart wus full of,--for pity and mercy for her boy, and other mothersâ€™
boys,--prayed with that fellowship of suffering that made her sweet
voice as pathetic as tears, and patheticker, so I have been told.
But one thing hurt her influence dretfully, and almost broke her own
heart. Paul had left a very large property, but it wus all in the
hands of an executor until the boy wus of age. He wus to give Cicely a
liberal, a very liberal, sum every year, but wus to manage the property
jest as he thought best.
He wus a good business man, and one that meant to do middlinâ€™ near
right, but wus close for a bargain, and sot, awful sot. And though he
wus dretful polite, and made a stiddy practice right along of callinâ€™
NA
Wall, he could get such big rents for drinkinâ€™-saloons, that four
of Cicelyâ€™s buildings wus rented for that purpose; and there wus one
billiard-room. And what made it worse for Cicely seeminâ€™ly, it wus her
own property, that she brought to Paul when she wus married, that wus
invested in these buildings. At that time they wus rented for dry-goods
stores, and groceries. But the business of the manufactories had
increased greatly; and there wus three times the population now there
wus when she went there to live, and more saloons wus needed; and these
buildings wus handy; and the executer had big prices offered to him,
and he would rent â€˜em as he wanted to. And then, he wus something of a
statesman; and he felt, as many business men did, that they wus fairly
sufferinâ€™ for more saloons to enrich the government.
Why, out of every hundred dollars that them poor laboring-men had earned
so hardly, and paid into the saloons for that which, of course, wus
ruinous to themselves and families, and, of course, rendered them
incapable of all labor for a great deal of the time,--why, out of that
hundred dollars, as many as 2 cents would go to the government to enrich
it.
Of course, the government had to use them 2 cents right off towards
buyinâ€™ tight-jackets to confine the madmen the whiskey had made, and
poorhouse-doors for the idiots it had breeded, to lean up aginst, and
buryinâ€™ the paupers, and buyinâ€™ ropes to hang the murderers it had
created.
But still, in some strange way, too deep, fur too deep, for a womanâ€™s
mind to comprehend, it wus dretful profitable to the government.
Now, if them poor laborinâ€™-men had paid that 2 cents of theirn to the
government themselves, in the first place, in direct taxation, why, that
wouldnâ€™t have been statesmanship. That is a deep study, and has a great
many curius performances, and it has to perform.
[Illustration: UNCLE SAM ENRICHING THE GOVERNMENT.]
Cicely tried her very best to get the executor to change in this one
matter; but she couldnâ€™t move him the width of a horse-hair, and he a
smilinâ€™ all the time at her, and polite. He liked Cicely: nobody could
help likinâ€™ the gentle, saintly-souled little woman. But he wus sot: he
wus makinâ€™ money fast by it, and she had to give up.
And rough men and women would sometimes twit her of it,--of her property
beinâ€™ used to advance the liquor-traffic, and ruin men and wimmen; and
she a feelinâ€™ like death about it, and her hands tied up, and powerless.
No wonder that her face got whiter and whiter, and her eyes bigger and
mournfuller-lookinâ€™.
Wall, she kepâ€™ on, tryinâ€™ to do all she could: she joined the Womanâ€™s
Temperance Union; she spent her money free as water, where she thought
it would do any good, and brought up the boy jest as near right as she
could possibly bring him up; and she prayed, and wept right when she wus
a bringinâ€™ of him, a thinkinâ€™ that _her_ property wus a beinâ€™ used every
day and every hour in ruininâ€™ other mothersâ€™ boys. And the boyâ€™s face
almost breakinâ€™ her heart every time she looked at it; for, though he
wus jest as pretty as a child could be, the pretty rosy lips had the
same good-tempered, irresolute curve to â€˜em that the boy inherited
honestly. And he had the same weak, waverinâ€™ chin. It was white and rosy
now, with a dimple right in the centre, sweet enough to kiss. But
the chin wus there, right under the rosy snow and the dimple; and I
foreboded, too, and couldnâ€™t blame Cicely a mite for her forebodinâ€™, and
her agony of sole.
I noticed them lips and that chin the very minute Josiah brought him
into the settinâ€™-room, and set him down; and my eyes looked dubersome at
him through my specks. Cicely see it, see that dubersome look, though
I tried to turn it off by kissinâ€™ him jest as hearty as I could after
I had took the little black-robed figure of his mother, and hugged her
close to my heart, and kissed her time and time agin.
She always dressed in the deepest of mourninâ€™, and always would. I knew
that.
Wall, we wus awful glad to see Cicely. I had had the old fireplace fixed
in the front spare room, and a crib put in there for the boy; and I went
right up to her room with her. And when we had got there, I took her
right in my arms agin, as I used to, and told her how glad I wus, and
how thankful I wus, to have her and the boy with us.
The fire sparkled up on the old brass handirons as warm as my welcome.
Her bed and the boyâ€™s bed looked white and cozy aginst the dark red
of the carpet and the cream-colored paper. And after I had lowered the
pretty ruffled muslin curtains (with red ones under â€˜em), and pulled
a stand forward, and lit a lamp,--it wus sundown,--the room looked
cheerful enough for anybody, and it seemed as if Cicely looked a little
less white and brokenhearted. She wus glad to be with me, and said
she wuz. But right there--before supper; and we could smell the roast
chicken and coffee, havinâ€™ left the stair-door open--right there, before
we had visited hardly any, or talked a mite about other wimmen, she
begun on what she wanted to do, and what she _must_ do, for the boy.
I had told her how the boy had grown, and that sot her off. And from
that night, every minute of her time almost, when she could without
beinâ€™ impolite and troublesome (Cicely wus a perfect lady, inside and
out), she would talk to me about what she wanted to do for the boy, to
have the laws changed before he grew up; she didnâ€™t dare to let him go
out into the world with the laws as they was now, with temptation on
every side of him.
[Illustration: THE SPARE ROOM.]
NA
husband died; but I want to live now. Why, I _must_ live; I cannot
die, I dare not die until my boy is safer. I will work, I will die if
NA
It wus the same old Cicely, I see, not carinâ€™ for herself, but carinâ€™
only for them she loved. Lovinâ€™ little creeter, good little creeter, she
always wuz, and always would be. And so I told Josiah.
Wall, we had the boy set between us to the supper-table, Josiah and me
did, in Thomas Jeffersonâ€™s little high-chair. I had new covered it on
purpose for him with bright copperplate calico.
And that night at supper, and after supper, I judged, and judged
calmly,--we made the estimate after we went to bed, Josiah and me
did,--that the boy asked 3 thousand and 85 questions about every thing
under the sun and moon, and things over â€˜em, and outside of â€˜em, and
inside.
Why, I panted for breath, but wouldnâ€™t give in. I was determined to use
Cicely first-rate, and we loved the boy too. But, oh! it was a weary
love, and a short-winded love, and a hoarse one.
We went to bed tuckered completely out, but good-natured: our love for
â€˜em held us up. And when we made the estimate, it wuznâ€™t in a cross
tone, but amiable, and almost winninâ€™. Josiah thought they went up into
the trillions. But I am one that never likes to set such things too
high; and I said calmly, 3,000 and 85. And finally he gin in that mebby
it wuznâ€™t no more than that.
Cicely told me she couldnâ€™t stay with us very long now; for her aunt
Mary wuz expectinâ€™ to go away to the Michigan pretty soon, to see a
daughter who wus out of health,--had been out of it for some time,--and
she wanted a visit from her neice Cicely before she went. But she
promised to come back, and make a good visit on her way home.
And so it was planned. The next day was Sunday, and Cicely wus too tired
with her journey to go to meetinâ€™. But the boy went. He sot up, lookinâ€™
beautiful, by the side of me on the back seat of the Democrat; his uncle
Josiah sot in front; and Ury drove. Ury Henzy, heâ€™s our hired man, and
a tolerable good one, as hired men go. His name is Urias; but we always
call him Ury,--spelt U-r-y, Ury,--with the emphasis on the U.
Wall, that day Elder Minkly preached. It wus a powerful sermon, about
the creation of the world, and how man was made, and the fall of Adam,
and about Noah and the ark, and how the wicked wus destroyed. It wus a
middlinâ€™ powerful sermon; and the boy sot up between Josiah and me, and
we wus proud enough of him. He had on a little green velvet suit and a
deep linen collar; and he sot considerable still for him, with his eyes
on Elder Minklyâ€™s face, a thinkinâ€™, I guess, how he would put us through
our catechism on the way home. And, oh! didnâ€™t he, didnâ€™t he do it? I
sâ€™pose things seem strange to children, and they canâ€™t help askinâ€™ about
â€˜em.
But 4,000 wus the estimate Josiah and me calculated on our pillows that
night wus the number of questions the boy asked on our way home, about
the creation, how the world wus made, and the ark--oh, how he harressed
my poor companion about the animals! â€œDid they drive 2 of all the

Josiah sithed; and, right while he wus a sithinâ€™, the boy commenced agin

about paradise. Josiah sweat, and offered to let the boy come back, and
set with me. He had insisted, when we started from the meetinâ€™-house, on
havinâ€™ the boy set on the front seat between him and Ury.
But I demurred about any change, and leaned back, and eat a sweet apple.
I donâ€™t think it is wrong Sundays to eat a sweet apple. And the boy kepâ€™
on.

But the boy went right on, in a tone of calm conviction,--
â€œNo big man would be apt to fall a walking right along. He fell out of

And then he says, after a minuteâ€™s still thought,--

â€œYes; and say! what kind of a apple was it that Adam eat? Was it a sweet

for all of us to fall down because Adam did? And how did _I_ sin just
because a man eat an apple, and fell out of an apple-tree, when I never
saw the apple, or poked him offen the tree, or joggled him, or any
thing--when I wasnâ€™t there? Say, how was it wrong, uncle Josiah? When I

me, and everybody that is on the earth, to keep a falling, and keep

â€œ_How_ can they keep a falling? If Adam fell out of the apple-tree,

Here Josiah got right up in the Democrat, and lifted the boy, and sot
him over on the seat with me, and took the lines out of Uryâ€™s hands, and
drove the old mair at a rate that I told him wus shameful on Sunday, for
a perfessor.
[Illustration: â€œIT WUS ON A SLAY-RIDE â€œ]
CHAPTER II.
Wall, Cicely and the boy staid till Tuesday night. Tuesday afternoon the
children wus all to home on a invitation. (I had a chicken-pie, and done
well by â€˜em.)
And nothinâ€™ to do but what Cicely and the boy must go home with â€˜em:
they jest think their eyes of Cicely. And I couldnâ€™t blame â€˜em for
wantinâ€™ her, though I hated to give her up.
She laid out to stay a few days, and then come back to our house for a
day or two, and then go on to her aunt Maryâ€™s. But, as it turned out,
the children urged her so, she stayed most two weeks.
And the very next day but one after Cicely went to the childrenâ€™s--And
donâ€™t it beat all how, if visitors get to cominâ€™, theyâ€™ll keep a cominâ€™?
jest as it is if you begin to have trials, youâ€™ll have lots of â€˜em, or
broken dishes, or any thing.
Wall, it wus the very next morninâ€™ but one after Cicely had gone, and
my voice had actually begun to sound natural agin (the boy had kepâ€™ me
hoarse as a frog answerinâ€™ questions). I wus whitewashinâ€™ the kitchen,
havinâ€™ put it off while Cicely wus there; and there wus a man to work a
patchinâ€™ up the wall in one of the chambers,--and right there and then,
Elburtus Smith Gansey come. And truly, we found him as clever a critter
as ever walked the earth.
It wus jest before korkuss; and he wus kinder visatinâ€™ round amongst
his relations, and makinâ€™ himself agreable. He is my 5th cousin,--5th
or 6th. I canâ€™t reely tell which, and I donâ€™t know as I care much; for
I think, that, after you get by the 5th, it hainâ€™t much matter anyway. I
sort oâ€™ pile â€˜em all in promiscous. Jest as it is after anybody gets to
be 70 years old, it hainâ€™t much matter how much older they be: they are
what you may call old, anyway.
But I think, as I said prior and beforehand, that he wus a 5th. His
mother wus a Butrick, and her mother wus a Smith. So he come to make us
a visit, and sort oâ€™ ellectioneer round. He wanted to get put in county
judge; and so, the korkuss beinâ€™ held in Jonesville, I sâ€™pose he thought
heâ€™d come down, and endear himself to us, as they all do.
I am one that likes company first-rate, and I always try to do well by
â€˜em; but I tell Josiah, that somehow city folks (Elburtus wus brought
up in a city) are a sort of a bother. They require so much, and give
you the feelinâ€™, that, when you are a doinâ€™ your very best for â€˜em, they
hainâ€™t satisfied. You see, some folksâ€™es best hainâ€™t nigh so good as
other folksâ€™es 3d or 4th.
But this feller--why! I liked him from the first minute I sot my eyes on
him. I hadnâ€™t seen him before sence I wus a child, and so didnâ€™t feel so
awful well acquainted with him; or, that is, I didnâ€™t, as it were, feel
intimate. You know, when you donâ€™t see anybody from the time you are
babies till you are married, and have lost a good many teeth, and
considerable hair, you canâ€™t feel over and above intimate with â€˜em at
first sight.
But I liked him, he wus so unassuming and friendly, and took every
thing so peaceable and pleasant. And he deserved better things than what
happened to him.
You see, I wus a cleaninâ€™ house when he come, cleaninâ€™ the kitchen at
that out-of-the-way time of year on account of Cicelyâ€™s visit, and on
account of repairinâ€™ that had promised to be done by Josiah Allen, and
delayed from week to week, and month to month, as is the way with men.
But finally he had got it done, and I wus ready to the minute with my
brush and scourinâ€™-cloth.
I wus a whitewashinâ€™ when he come, and my pail of whitewash wus hung
up over the kitchen-door; and I stood up on a table, a whitewashinâ€™ the
ceilin, when I heard a buggy drive up to the door, and stop. And I stood
still, and listened; and then I heard a awful katouse and rumpus, and
then I heard hollerinâ€™; and then I heard Josiahâ€™s voice, and somebody
elseâ€™s voice, a talkinâ€™ back and forth, sort oâ€™ quick and excited.
Now, some wimmen would have been skairt, and acted skairt; but I didnâ€™t.
I jest stood up on that table, cool and calm as a statue of Repose
sculped out of marble, and most as white (I wus all covered with
whitewash), with my brush held easy and firm in my right hand, and my
left ear a listeninâ€™.
Pretty soon the door opened right by the side of the table, and in come
Josiah Allen and a strange man. He introduced him to me as Elburtus
Gansey, my 4th cousin; and I made a handsome curchy. I sâ€™pose, beinâ€™ up
on the table, the curchy showed off to better advantage than it would if
I had been on the floor: it looked well. But I felt that I ort to shake
hands with him; and, as I went to step down into a chair to get down
(entirely unbeknown to me), my brush hit against that pail, and down
come that pail of whitewash right onto his back. (If it had been his
head, it would have broke it.)
[Illustration: EXCELLENT LIME.]
I felt as if I should sink. But he took it the best that ever wus. He
said, when Josiah and me wus a sweepinâ€™ him off, and a rubbinâ€™ him off
NA
polite and courteous, that â€œit seemed to be first-rate whitewash: he
NA
 And then he sort oâ€™ felt of it between his thumb and finger, and asked
Josiah â€œwhere did he get that lime, and if they had any more of it. He
NA
like a perfect gentleman.
And he told me, in that same polite, pleasant tone, how Josiahâ€™s old
sheep had knocked him over 3 times while he wus a cominâ€™ into the house.
He said, with that calm, gentle smile, â€œthat no sooner would he get up,
than he would stand off a little, and then rush at him with his head
NA
NA
told you, Josiah Allen, that some stranger would get killed by that old
NA
NA
Elburtus said â€œit would almost seem to be a pity, it was so strong and
NA
that seemed to have a sounder, stronger constitution. He said of course
the sheep and he hadnâ€™t met under the pleasantest of circumstances, and
it wusnâ€™t over and above pleasant to be knocked down by it three or four
times; but he had found that he couldnâ€™t have every thing as he wanted
it in this world, and the only way to enjoy ourselves wus to take things
as they come.
NA
NA
And then he went on to say in that amiable way of hisen, â€œthat it
probably made it a little harder for him jest at that time, as he

NA
NA
NA
NA
our Jonesville lightninâ€™. He said it wus about the cleanest, quickest
lightninâ€™ he ever see. He said he believed we had the smartest lightninâ€™
in our county that you could find in the nation.
So good he acted about every thing. It beat all. Why, he hadnâ€™t been in
the house half an hour when he offered to help me whitewash. I told him
I wouldnâ€™t let him, for it would spile his clothes, and he hadnâ€™t ever
been there a visitinâ€™ before, and I didnâ€™t want to put him to work.
But he hung on, and nothinâ€™ to do but what he had got to take hold and
whitewash. And I had to give up and let him; for I thought it wus better
manners to put a visiter to work, than it wus to dispute and quarrel
with â€˜em: and, of course, he wasnâ€™t used to it, and he filled one eye
most full of lime. It wus dretful painful, dretful.
But I swabbed it out with viniger, and it got easier about the middle of
the afternoon. It beinâ€™ work that he never done before, the whitewashinâ€™
looked like fury; but I done it all over after him, and so I got along
with it, though it belated me. But his offerinâ€™ to do it showed his good
will, anyway.
I shouldnâ€™t have done any more at all after Elburtus had come, only I
had got into the job, and had to finish it; for I always think it is
better manners, when visitors come unexpected, and ketch you in some
mean job, to go on and finish it as quick as you can, ruther than to set
down in the dirt, and let them, ditto, and the same.
And Josiah was ketched jest as I wus, for he had a piece of winter wheat
that wus spilinâ€™ to be cut; and he had got the most of it down, and had
to finish it: it wus lodged so he had to cut it by hand,--the machine
wouldnâ€™t work on it. And jest as quick as Elburtus had got so he could
see out of that eye, nothinâ€™ to do but what he had got to go out and
help Josiah cut that wheat. He hadnâ€™t touched a scythe for years and
years, and it wasnâ€™t ten minutes before his hands wus blistered on the
inside. But he would keep at it till the blisters broke, and then he had
to stop anyway.
He got along quite well after that: only the lot where Josiah wus to
work run along by old Bobbetâ€™ses, and he had carried a jug of sweetened
water and viniger and ginger out into the lot, and Elburtus had talked
so polite and cordial to him, a conversinâ€™ on politics, that he got
attached to him, and treated him to the sweetened water.
[Illustration: ELBURTUS ENDEARINâ€™ HIMSELF TO MR. BOBBET.]
And Elburtus, not wantinâ€™ to hurt his feelinâ€™s, drinked about 3 quarts.
It made him deathly sick, for it went aginst his stomach from the first:
he never loved it. And Miss Bobbet duz fix it dretful sickish,--sweetens
it with sale mollasses for one thing.
Oh, how sick that feller wus when he come in to supper! had to lay right
down on the lounge.
Says I, â€œElburtus, what made you drink it, when it went aginst your

NA
Says I, out to one side, â€œDid you ever, Josiah Allen, see such goodness

NA
NA
Wall, that night his bed got a fire. It seemed as if every thing under
the sun wus a goinâ€™ to happen to that man while he wus here. You see,
the house wus all tore up a repairing and I had to put him up-stairs:
and the bed had been moved out by carpenters, to plaster a spot behind
the bed; and, unbeknown to me, they had set it too near the stove-pipe.
And the hot pipe run right up by the side of it, right by the
bed-clothes. It took fire from the piller-case.
We smelt a dretful smudge, and Josiah run right up-stairs: it had only
jest ketched a fire, and Elburtus was sound asleep; and Josiah, the
minute he see what wus the matter, he jest ketched up the water-pitcher,
and throwed the water over him; and beinâ€™ skairt and tremblinâ€™, the
pitcher flew out of his hand, and went too, and hit Elburtus on the end
of his nose, and took a piece of skin right off.
He waked up sudden; and there he wus, all drownded out, and a piece gone
off of his nose.
Now, most any other man would have acted mad. Josiah would have acted
mad as a mad dog, and madder. But you ort to see how good Elburtus took
it, jest as quick as he got his senses back. Josiah said he could almost
take his oath that he swore out as cross a oath as he ever heard swore
the first minute before he got his eyes opened, but I believe he wus
mistaken. But anyway, the minute his senses come back, and he see where
he wuz, you ort to see how he behaved. Never, never did I hear of such
manners in all my born days! Josiah told me all about it.
There Elburtus stood, with his nose a bleedinâ€™, and his whiskers singed,
and a drippinâ€™ like a mushrat. But, instead of jawinâ€™ or complaininâ€™,
the first thing he said wuz, â€œWhat a splendid draft our stove must have,
NA
late in the eveninâ€™, and left a fire in the stove.)
And he said our stove-wood must be of the very best quality; and he
asked Josiah where he got it, and if he had to pay any thing extra for
that kind. He said heâ€™d give any thing if he could get holt of a cord of
such wood as that!
Josiah said he felt fairly stunted to see such manners; and he went
to apologisinâ€™ about how awful bad it was for him to get his whiskers
singed so, and how it wus a pure axident his lettinâ€™ the pitcher slip
out of his hand, and he wouldnâ€™t have done it for nothinâ€™ if he could
have helped it, and he wus afraid it had hurt him more than he thought
for.
And such manners as that clever critter showed then! He said he was a
calculatinâ€™ to get his whiskers cut that very day, and it was all for
the best; he persumed they wus singed off in jest the shape he wanted
â€˜em: and as for his nose, he wus always ashamed of it; it wus always too
long, and he should be glad if there wus a piece gone off of it: Josiah
had done him a favor to help him get rid of a piece of it.
Why, when Josiah told it all over to me after he come down, I told him
â€œI believed sunthinâ€™ would happen to that man before long. I believed he
NA
Josiah canâ€™t bear to hear me praise up any mortal man only himself, and
he muttered sunthinâ€™ about â€œhe bet he wouldnâ€™t be so tarnel good after

But I wouldnâ€™t hear 110 such talk; and says I,--
NA
NA
â€œWall, wall! who said I wus a goinâ€™ to? I shall probable vote in the

I gin him a witherinâ€™ look; but, as it wus dark as pitch in the room,
he didnâ€™t act withered any. And I spoke out agin, and says I, in a low,
deep voice,--
â€œIf it wus one of the relations on your side, Josiah Allen, you would
NA
And he says, â€œThere is such a thing, Samantha, as beinâ€™ _too_ good--too
NA
I didnâ€™t multiply any more words with him, and we went to sleep.
Wall, that is jest the way that feller acted for the next five days.
Why, the neighbors all got to lovinâ€™ him so, why, they jest about
worshipped him. And Josiah said that there wuznâ€™t no use a talkinâ€™,
Elburtus would get the nomination unanimous; for everybody that had
seen him appear (and he had been all over the town appearing to â€˜em, and
endearinâ€™ himself to â€˜em, cleer out beyond Jonesville as far as Spoon
Settlement and Loontown), why, they jest thought their eyes of him, he
wus so thoughtful and urbane and helpful. Why, there hainâ€™t no tellinâ€™
how much helpfuler he wuz than common folks, and urbaner.
Why, Josiah and me drove into Jonesville one day towards night; and
Elburtus had been there all day. Josiah had some cross-gut saws that he
wanted to get filed, and had happened to mention it before Elburtus; and
nothinâ€™ to do but he must go and carry â€˜em to the man in Jonesville that
wus goinâ€™ to do it, and help him file â€˜em. Josiah told him we wus goinâ€™
over towards night with the team, and could carry â€˜em as well as not;
and he hadnâ€™t better try to help, filinâ€™ saws wus such a sort of a
raspinâ€™ undertakinâ€™. But Elburtus said â€œhe should probably go through
more raspinâ€™ jobs before he died, or got the nomination; and Josiah
NA
a foot.
[Illustration: ELBERTUS APPEARINâ€™]
Wall, when we drove in, I see Elburtus a liftinâ€™ and a lugginâ€™, a
loadinâ€™ a big barrell into a double wagon for a farmer; and I says,--

And Josiah says, in a gay tone,--

heavy, and political life is wearinâ€™, when anybody goes into it deep,
NA
He seemed to think it wus a joke; but I says,--
â€œHe is jest a killinâ€™ himself, Josiah Allen; and you would set here, and
NA
NA
NA
NA
Elburtus had finished loadinâ€™ the salt, and now he wus a holdinâ€™ the
horses for the man to load some spring-beds. And the horses wus skairt
by â€˜em, and wuz jest a liftinâ€™ Elburtus right up offen his feet. Why,
they pranced, and tore, and lifted him up, and switched him round, and
then theyâ€™d set him down with a crash, and whinner.
But that man smiled all the time, and took off his hat, and bowed to me:
we went by when he wus a swinginâ€™ right up in the air. I never see the
beat of his goodness. Why, we found out afterwards, that, besides filinâ€™
them saws, he had loaded seven barrells of salt that day, besides other
heavy truck. That night he wus perfectly beat out--but good.
Josiah said that Philander Daggetâ€™ses wiveâ€™s brother wouldnâ€™t have no
chance at all. He wanted the nomination awful, and Philander had been
a workinâ€™ for him all he could; and if Elburtus hadnâ€™t come down to
Jonesville, and showed off such a beautiful demeanor and actions, why,
we all thought that Philanderâ€™s wiveâ€™s brother would have got it. And I
couldnâ€™t help feelinâ€™ kind oâ€™ sorry for him, though highly tickled for
Elburtus. We both of us, Josiah and me, felt very pleased and extremely
tickled to think that Elburtus wus so sure of it; for there wus a good
deal of money in the office, besides honor, sights of honor.
Wall, when the morninâ€™ of town-meetinâ€™ came, that critter wus so awful
clever that nothinâ€™ to do but what he must help Josiah do the chores.
And amongst other chores Josiah had to do that morninâ€™, wus to carry
home a plow that belonged to old Dagget. And old Dagget wanted Josiah,
when he had got through with it, to carry it to his son Philanderâ€™s: and
Philander had left word that he wanted it that morninâ€™; and he wanted it
carried down to his lower barn, that stood in a meadow a mile away from
any house. Philanderâ€™ses land run in such a way that he had to build it
there to store his fodder.
Wall, time run along, and it got time to start for town-meetinâ€™, and
Elburtus couldnâ€™t be found. I hollered to him from the back stoop, and
Josiah went out to the barn and hollered; but nothinâ€™ could be seen of
him. And Josiah got all ready, and waited, and waited; and I told him
that Elburtus had probable got in such a hurry to get there, that he
had started on a foot, and he had better drive on, and he would
overtake him. So finally he did; and he drove along clear to Jonesville,
expectinâ€™ to overtake him every minute, and didnâ€™t. And the hull day
passed off, and no Elburtus. And nobody had seen him. And everybody
thought it looked so curius in him, a disapearinâ€™ as he did, when they
all knew that he had come down to our part of the county a purpose
to get the nomination. Why, his disapearinâ€™ as he did looked so awful
strange, that they didnâ€™t know what to make of it.
[Illustration: ELBURTUS HOLDING THE HORSES.]
And the opposition side, Philander Daggetsâ€™es wiveâ€™s brotherâ€™s friends,
started the story that he wus arrested for stealinâ€™ a sheep, and wus
dragged off to jail that morninâ€™.
Of course Josiah tried to dispute it; but, as he wus as much in the dark
as any of â€˜em as to where he wuz, his disputinâ€™ of it didnâ€™t amount to
any thing. And then, Josiahâ€™s feelinâ€™ so strange about Elburtus made his
eyes look kinder glassy and strange when they wus talkinâ€™ to him about
it; and they got up the story, so I hearn, that Josiah helped him off
with the sheep, and wus feelinâ€™ like death to have him found out.
And the friends of Philander Daggetsâ€™es wiveâ€™s brother had it all their
own way, and he wus elected almost unanimous. Wall, Josiah come home
early, he wus so worried about Elburtus. He thought mebby he had come
back home after he had got away, and wus took sick sudden. And his first
words to me wuz,--
NA
And then wus my time to be smit and horrow-struck. And the more we got
to thinkinâ€™ about it, the more wonderful did it seem to us, that
that man had dissapeared right in broad daylight, jest as sudden and
mysterious as if the ground had opened, and swallowed him down, or as if
he had spread a pair of wings, and flown up into the sky.
Not that I really thought he had. I couldnâ€™t hardly associate the idee
of heaven and endless repose with a short frock-coat and boots, and
a blue necktie and a stiff shirt-collar. But, oh! how strange and
mysterious it did seem to be! We talked it over and over, and we could
not think of any thing that could happen to him. He knew enough to keep
out of the creek; and there wasnâ€™t no woods nigh where he could get
lost, and he wus too old to be stole. And so we thought and thought, and
racked our 2 brains.
And finally I says, â€œWall! it hainâ€™t happened for several thousand
years, but I donâ€™t know what to think. We read of folks beinâ€™ translated
up to heaven when they get too good for earth, and you know I have told
you several times that he wus too clever for earth. I have thought he

NA
NA
Says I, â€œJosiah Allen, I should be afraid, if I wus in your place, to
NA
see his actions when he wus knocked over by that sheep, and covered with
lime, and sot fire to, I have felt as if we wus entertaininâ€™ a angel
NA
NA
His axent wus dry, dry as chaff, and as full of ironry as a oven-door or
flat-iron.
NA
NA
it wus one of the relation on your side, mebby you would talk different
NA
â€œWhat do you sâ€™pose I care which side he wus on? And I should think it
wus time to have a little sunthinâ€™ to eat: it must be three oâ€™clock if
NA
NA
NA
NA
Says I, â€œThe best thing you can do, Josiah Allen, is to foller his
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
Says I, â€œWhen a man gets too good for earth, there is other ways to
translate him besides chariots of fire. Who knows but what he has fell
down in a fit! And do you go this minute, Josiah Allen, and foller his
NA
â€œI shaâ€™nâ€™t foller nobodyâ€™s tracks, Samantha Allen, till I have sunthinâ€™
NA
I knew there wuznâ€™t no use of reasoninâ€™ no further with him then; for
when he said Samantha Allen in that axent, I knew he wus as sot as a
hemlock post, and as hard to move as one. And so my common sense beinâ€™
so firm and solid, even in such a time as this, I reasoned it right out,
he wouldnâ€™t stir till he had sunthinâ€™ to eat, and so the sooner I got
his supper, the sooner he would go and foller Elburtusâ€™es tracks. So I
didnâ€™t spend no more strength a arguinâ€™, but kepâ€™ it to hurry up; and
my reason is such, strong and vigorous and fur-seeinâ€™, that I knew the
better supper he had, the more animated would be his search. So I got a
splendid supper, but quick.
[Illustration: HUNTING FOR ELBURTUS.]
But, oh! all the time I wus a gettinâ€™ it, this solemn and awful question
wus a hantinâ€™ me,--What had become of Elburtus Smith Gansey? What had
become of the relation on my side? Oh, the feelinâ€™s I felt! Oh, the
emotions I carried round with me, from buttery to teakettle, and from
teapot to table!
But finally, after eatinâ€™ longer than it seemed to me he ever eat before
(such wus my feelinâ€™s), Josiah started off acrost the lot, towards
Daggetsâ€™es barn. And I stood in the west door, with my hand over my
eyes, a watchinâ€™ him most every minute he wus gone. And when that man
come back, he come a laughinâ€™. And I wus that madded, to have him look
in that sort of a scorfinâ€™ way, that I wouldnâ€™t say a word to him; and
he come into the house a laughinâ€™, and sot down and crossed his legs a
laughinâ€™, and says he,--
NA
he, snickerinâ€™ agin,--
NA
agin he snickered loud. And says I coldly, cold as ice almost,--
â€œIf I wuznâ€™t a perfect luny, or idiot, Iâ€™d talk as if I knew sunthinâ€™.
You know I said that, as one who allegores. If you have found Elburtus
NA
NA
me. He got locked up in Daggetâ€™s barn. He asscended, jest as I told you.
He went up the ladder over the hay, to throw down fodder, and got locked
NA
ever.
And I says, â€œIt is a mean, miserable, good for nothinâ€™, low-lived
caper! And Philander Dagget done it a purpose to keep Elburtus from the
town-meetinâ€™, so his wiveâ€™s brother would get the election. And, if
I wus Elburtus Gansey, Iâ€™d sue him, and serve a summons on him, and
NA
NA
look onto him, â€œPhilander says he never felt so worked up about any
thing in his life, as he did when he unlocked the barn-door to-night,
and found Elburtus there. He said he felt as if he should sink, for
he wus so afraid that some evil-minded person might say he done it a
purpose. And he said what made him feel the worst about it wuz to think
that he should have shut him up axidental when he wus a helpinâ€™ so
NA
NA
NA
NA
I wouldnâ€™t multiply no more words on the subject, I wus that wrought up
and excited and mad; and I wouldnâ€™t give in a mite to Josiah Allen, and
wouldnâ€™t want it repeated now so he could hear it, but I do sâ€™pose that
wus the great trouble with Elburtus,--he wus a leetle _too_ good.
And, come to think it over, I donâ€™t sâ€™pose Philander had laid any plot
to keep him away from â€˜lection; but he is a great case for fun, and he
had laughed and tickled about Elburtus beinâ€™ so polite and helpful, and
had made a good deel of fun of him. And then, he thinks a awful sight of
his wiveâ€™s brother, and wanted him to get the election.
And I sâ€™pose the idee come to him after Elburtus had got down to the
barn where he wus a fodderinâ€™ his sheep.
You see, if Elburtus had let well enough alone, and not been _too_ good,
every thing would have gone off right then, but he wouldnâ€™t. Nothinâ€™ to
do but he must help Philander get down his fodder. And I sâ€™pose then
the idee come to him that he would shet him up, and keep him there till
after â€˜lection wus over. For I donâ€™t believe a word about its beinâ€™ a
axident. And I donâ€™t believe Josiah duz, though he pretends he duz. But
NA
aggravatinâ€™. That is what mads me to this day.
But, as Josiah says, who would have thought that Elburtus would have
offered to carry that plow home, and throw down the fodder?
But, at any rate, Philander turned the key on him while he wus up
over-head, and locked him in there for the day. A meaner, low-liveder,
miserabler caper, I never see nor heard of.
But the way Philander gets out of it (he is a natural liar, and has had
constant practice), he donâ€™t deny lockinâ€™ the door, but he says he wus
to work on the outside of the barn, and he sâ€™posed Elburtus had gone
out, and gone home; and he locked the door, and went away.
He says (the mean, sneakinâ€™, hippocritical creeter!) that he feels like
death about it, to think it happened so, and on that day too. And he
says what makes him feel the meanest is, to think it was his wiveâ€™s
brother that wus up on the other side, and got the nomination. He says
it leaves room for talk.
And there it is. You canâ€™t sue a man for lockinâ€™ his own barn-door. And
Elburtus wouldnâ€™t want it brought into court, anyway; for folks would
be a wonderinâ€™ so what under the sun he wus a prowlinâ€™ round for up
overhead in Philander Daggetsâ€™es barn.
So he wus obliged to let the subject drop, and Philander has it all his
own way. And they say his wiveâ€™s brother give him ten silver dollars
for his help. And that is pretty good pay for turninâ€™ one lock, about 2
secontsâ€™ work.
Wall, anyway, that wus the last thing that happened to Elburtus in
Jonesville; and whether he took it polite and easy, or not, I donâ€™t
know. For that night, when Philander went down to the barn to fodder,
jest before Josiah went there, and let him out (and acted perfectly
suprised and horrified at findinâ€™ him there, Philander did, so I have
been told), Elburtus started a bee-line for the depo, and never come
back here at all; and he left a good new handkerchief, and a shirt, and
3 paper collars.
And whether he has kepâ€™ on a sufferinâ€™, or not, I donâ€™t know. Mebby he
had his trials in one batch, as you may say, and is now havinâ€™ a spell
of enjoyments. I am sure, I hope so; for a cleverer, good-natureder,
polite-appearinâ€™er creeter, _I_ never see, nor donâ€™t expect to see agin
in my life; and so I tell Josiah.
CHAPTER III.
The next eveninâ€™ follerinâ€™ after the exodus of Elburtus Gansey, Josiah
and I, thinkinâ€™ that we needed a relaxation to relax our two minds, rode
into Jonesville. We went in the Democrat, at my request; for I wus in
hopes Cicely would come home with us.
And she did. We had a good ride. I sot in front with Josiah at his
request; and what made it pleasanter wuz, the boy stood up in the
Democrat behind me a good deal of the way, with his arms round my neck,
a kissinâ€™ me.
And when I waked up in the morninâ€™, I wus glad to think they wus there.
Though Cicely wuznâ€™t well: I could see she wuznâ€™t. I felt sad at the
breakfast-table to see how her fresh young beauty wus beinâ€™ blowed away
by the sharp breath of sorrowâ€™s gale.
But she wus sweet and gentle as ever the posy wus we had named her
after. No Sweet Cicely blow wus ever sweeter and purer than she wuz.
After I got my work all done up below,--she offerinâ€™ to help me, and a
not lettinâ€™ her lift her finger,--I went up into her room, where there
wus a bright fire on the hearth, and every thing looked cozy and snug.
The boy, havinâ€™ wore himself out a harrowinâ€™ his uncle Josiah and Ury
with questions, had laid down on the crimson rug in front of the fire,
and wus fast asleep, gettinâ€™ strength for new labors.
And Cicely sot in a little low rockinâ€™-chair by the side of him. She had
on a white flannel morninâ€™-dress, and a thin white zephyr worsted shawl
round her; and her silky brown hair hung down her back, for she had been
a brushinâ€™ it out; and she looked sweet and pretty enough to kiss; and I
kissed her right there, before I sot down, or any thing.
And then, thinksâ€™es I as I sot down, we will have a good, quiet visit,
and talk some about other wimmen. (No runninâ€™ â€˜em: Iâ€™d scorn it, and so
would she.)
But I thought Iâ€™d love to talk it over with her, about what good
housekeepers Tirzah Ann and Maggie wuz. And I wanted to hear what she
thought about the babe, and if she could say in cander that she ever see
a little girl equal her in graces of mind and body.
And I wanted to hear all about her aunt Mary and her aunt Melissa (on
her fatherâ€™s side). I knew she had had letters from â€˜em. And I wanted
to hear how she that was Jane Smith wuz, that lived neighbor to her
aunt Maryâ€™s oldest daughter, and how that oldest daughter wuz, who
wus sâ€™posed to be a runninâ€™ down. And I wanted to hear about Susan Ann
Grimshaw, who had married her aunt Melissyâ€™s youngest son. There wus
lots of news that I felt fairly sufferinâ€™ for, and lots of news that I
felt like disseminatinâ€™ to her.
But, if youâ€™ll believe it, jest as I had begun to inquire, and take
comfort, she branched right off, a lady-like branch, and a courteous
one, but still a branch, and begun to talk about â€œwhat should she

And she looked down on him as he lay there, with such a boundless love,
and a awful dread in her eyes, that it was pitiful in the extreme to see
her; and says she,--
â€œWhat will become of him in the future, aunt Samantha, with the laws as
NA
[Illustration: THE BABY.]
And with such a chin and mouth as he has got, says I to myself, lookinâ€™
down on him; but I didnâ€™t say it out loud. I am too well bread.
â€œIt must be we can get the laws changed before he grows up. I dare not
trust him in a world that has such temptations, such snares set ready
NA
would always throw her whole soul into any thing she undertook; and in
this she had throwed her hull heart, too, and her hull life--or so it
seemed to me, to look at her pale face, and her big, glowinâ€™ eyes, full
of sadness, full of resolve too.
â€œWhy, just think of it! How he will be coaxed into those
drinking-saloons! how, with his easy, generous, good-natured ways,--and
I know he will have such ways, and be popular,--a bright, handsome young
man, and with plenty of money. Just think of it! how, with those open
saloons on every side of him, when he canâ€™t walk down the street without
those gilded bars shining on every hand; and the friends he will make,
gay, rich, thoughtless young men like himself--they will laugh at him
if he refuses to do as they do; and with my boyâ€™s inherited tastes and
temperament, his easiness to be led by those he loves, what will hinder
him from going to ruin as his poor father did? What will keep him, aunt
NA
And she busted out a cryinâ€™.
NA
and trembled like a leaf. Some folks would have called her nervous and
excitable; but I didnâ€™t, thinkinâ€™ what she had went through with the
boyâ€™s father.
Says I, â€œThere is One who is able to save him. And, instead of gettinâ€™
yourself all worked up over what may never be, I think it would be
NA
NA
NA
And sometimes she would hush up, and sometimes she wouldnâ€™t.
But how she would talk about what she wanted to do for him! I heard her
talkinâ€™ to her uncle Josiah one day.
You see, she worried about the boy to that extent, and loved him so,
that she would have been willinâ€™ to have had her head took right off,
if that would have helped him, if it would have insured him a safe and
happy future; but it wouldnâ€™t: and so she was willinâ€™ to do any other
hard job if there wus any prospect of its helpinâ€™ the boy.
She wus willinâ€™ to vote on the temperance question.
But Josiah wus more sot than usial that morninâ€™ aginst wimmenâ€™s votinâ€™;
and he had begun himself on the subject to Cicely; had talked powerful
aginst it, but gentle: he loved Cicely as he did his eyes.
He had been to a lecture the night before, to Toad Holler, a little
place between Jonesville and Loontown. He and uncle Nate Burpy went up
to hear a speech aginst wimmenâ€™s suffrage, in a Democrat.
Josiah said it wus a powerful speech. He said uncle Nate said, â€œThe
NA
NA
And I said I persumed, from what I had heard of it, that his mind wuz
tired, and ort to set down and rest.
I spoke light, because Josiah Allen acted so high-headed about it. But I
do sâ€™pose it wus a powerful effort, from what I hearn.
He talked dretful smart, they say, and used big words.
[Illustration: A GREAT EFFORT.]
The young feller that gin the lecture, and his sister, oldest, and she
set her eyes by him. She had took care of the old folks, supported â€˜em
and lifted â€˜em round herself; took all the care of â€˜em in every way
till they died: and then this boy didnâ€™t seem to have much faculty for
gettinâ€™ along; so she educated him, sewed for tailorsâ€™ shops, and got
money, and sent him to school and college, so he could talk big.
And it was such a comfort to that sister, to sort oâ€™ rest off for
an eveninâ€™ from makinâ€™ vests and pantaloons, cheap, to furnish him
money!--it was so sort oâ€™ restful to her to set and hear him talk large
aginst wimmenâ€™s suffrage and the weakness and ineficiency of wimmen!
He said, the young chap did, and proved it right out, so they said,
â€œthat the franchise was too tuckerinâ€™ a job for wimmen to tackle, and
that wimmen hadnâ€™t the earnestness and persistency and deep forethought
NA
You see, he had his hull strength, the young chap did; for his sister
had clothed him, as well as boarded him, and educated him: so he could
talk powerful. He could use up quantities of wind, and not miss it,
havinâ€™ all his strength.
His speech made a deep impression on men and wimmen. His sister beinâ€™
so wore out, workinâ€™ so hard, wept for joy, it was so beautiful, and
affected her so powerful. And she said â€œshe never realized till that
minute how weak and useless wimmen really was, and how strong and
NA
It wus a great effort. And she got a extra good supper for him that
night, I heard, wantinâ€™ to repair the waste in his system, caused
by eloquence. She wus supportinâ€™ him till he got a client: he wus a
studyinâ€™ law.
Wall, Josiah wus jest full of his arguments; and he talked â€˜em over to
Cicely that morninâ€™.
But she said, after hearinâ€™ â€˜em all, â€œthat she wus willinâ€™ to vote

â€œThought how the nation lay under the curse of African slavery until
that race of slaves were freed. And she believed, that when women who
were now in legal bondage, were free to act as their heart and reason
dictated, that they, who suffered most from intemperance, would be the
NA
Curius that she should feel so, but you couldnâ€™t get the idee out of her
head. She had pondered over it day and night, she said,--pondered over
it, and prayed over it.
And, come to think it over, I donâ€™t know as it wus so curius after all,
when I thought how Paul had ruined himself, and broke her heart, and
how her money wus beinâ€™ used now to keep grog-shops open, four of her
buildinâ€™s rented to liquor-dealers, and she couldnâ€™t help herself.
Cicely owned lots of other landed property in the village where she
lived; and so, of course, her property wus all taxed accordinâ€™ to its
worth. And its beinâ€™ the biggest property there, of course it helped
more than any thing else did to keep the streets smooth and even before
the saloon-doors, so drunkards could get there easy; and to get new
street-lamps in front of the saloons and billiard-rooms, so as to make a
real bright light to draw â€˜em in and ruin â€˜em.
There wus a few--the doctor, who knew how rum ruined menâ€™s bodies; and
the minister, he knew how it ruined menâ€™s souls--they two, and a few
others, worked awful hard to get the saloons shut up.
But the executor, who wanted the town to go license, soâ€™s he could make
money, and thinkinâ€™ it would be for her interest in the end, hired votes
with her money. Her money used to hire liquor-votes! So she heard, and
believed. The idee!
So her money, and his influence, and the influence of low appetites,
carried the day; and the liquor-traffic won. The men who rented her
houses, voted for license to a man. Her property used agin to spread the
evil! She labored with these men with tears in her eyes. And they liked
her. She was dretful good to â€˜em. (As I say, she held the things of this
world with a loose grip.)
They listened to her respectful, stood with their hats in theirâ€™ hands,
answerinâ€™ her soft, and went soft out of her presence--and voted license
to a man. You see, they wus all willinâ€™ to give her love and courtesy
and kindness, but not the right to do as her heaven-learnt sense of
right and wrong wanted her to. She had a fine mind, a pure heart: she
had been through the highest schools of the land, and that higher,
heavenly school of sufferinâ€™, where God is the teacher, and had
graduated from â€˜em with her lofty purposes refined and made luminous
with some thinâ€™ like the light of Heaven.
But those men--many of â€˜em who did not know a letter of the alphabet,
whose naturally dull minds had become more stupified by habitual
vice--those men, who wus her inferiors, and her servants in every thing
else, wus each one of â€˜em her king here, and she his slave: and they
compelled her to obey their lower wills.
Wall, Cicely didnâ€™t think it wus right. Curius she should think so, some
folks thought, but she did.
But all this that wore on her wus as nothinâ€™ to what she felt about the
boy,--her fears for his future. â€œWhat could she do--what _could_ she do
NA
And I had jest this one answer, that Iâ€™d say over and over agin to
her,--
â€œCicely, you can pray! That is all that wimmen can do. And try to

â€œBut I canâ€™t keep him with me always; and other influences will come,

NA
And she says, â€œWhy, how I prayed for help when my poor Paul went down to
ruin, through the open door of a grog-shop! If the women of the land had
it in their power to do what their hearts dictate,--what the poorest,
lowest _man_ has the right to do,--every saloon, every low grog-shop,

She said this to Josiah the morninâ€™ after the lecture I speak of. He sot
there, seeminâ€™ly perusinâ€™ the almanac; but he spoke up then, and says,--
â€œYou canâ€™t shet up human nater, Cicely: that will jump out any way. As

But Cicely went right on, with her eyes a shininâ€™, and a red spot in her
white cheeks that I didnâ€™t like to see.
â€œA thousand temptations that surround my boy now, could be removed, a
thousand low influences changed into better, helpful ones. There are
drunkards who long, who pray, to have temptations removed out of their
way,--those who are trying to reform, and who dare not pass the door of
a saloon, the very smell of the liquor crazing them with the desire for
drink. They want help, they pray to be saved; and we who are praying to
help them are powerless. What if, in the future, my boy should be like
one of them,--weak, tempted, longing for help, and getting nothing but
help towards vice and ruin? Havenâ€™t mothers a right to help those
they love in _every_ way,--by prayer, by influence, by legal right and

NA
right leg over his left, and turninâ€™ the almanac to another month. â€œIt
seems to me sunthinâ€™ unwomanly, sunthinâ€™ aginst nater. It is turninâ€™
the laws of nater right round. It is perilous to the domestic nature of

NA
you worried about them hens that we carried to the fair? They wus so
handsome, and such good layers, that I really wanted the influence of
them hens to spread abroad. I wanted otherfolks to know about â€˜em, soâ€™s
to have some like â€˜em. But you worried awfully. You wus so afraid that
carryinâ€™ the hens into the turmoil of public life would have a tendency
to keep â€˜em from wantinâ€™ to make nests and hatch chickens! But it
didnâ€™t. Good land! one of â€˜em made a nest right there, in the coop to
the fair, with the crowd a shoutinâ€™ round â€˜em, and laid two eggs. You
canâ€™t break up natureâ€™s laws; _they_ are laid too deep and strong for
any hammer we can get holt of to touch â€˜em; all the nations and empires
of the world canâ€™t move â€˜em round a notch.
â€œA true womanâ€™s deepest love and desire are for her home and her loved
ones, and planted right in by the side of these two loves of hern is a
deathless instinct and desire to protect and save them from danger.
[Illustration: SAMANTHAâ€™S HENS.]
â€œGood land! I never heard a old hen called out of her spear, and
unhenly, because she would fly out at a hawk, and cackle loud, and
cluck, and try to lead her chickens off into safety. And while the
rooster is a steppinâ€™ high, and struttinâ€™ round, and lookinâ€™ surprised
and injured, it is the old hen that saves the chickens, nine times out
of ten.
â€œIt is against the evil hawks,--men-hawks,--that are ready to settle
down, and tear the young and innocent out of the home nest, that
wimmen are tryinâ€™ to defend their children from. And men may talk about
wimmenâ€™s gettinâ€™ too excited and zealous; but they donâ€™t cluck and
cackle half so loud as the old hen does, or flutter round half so
earnest and fierce.

in her to want to protect him, and tenderness, and nature, and grace,

I wus wrought up, and felt deeply, and couldnâ€™t express half what I
felt, and didnâ€™t much care if I couldnâ€™t. I wus so rousted up, I felt
fairly reckless about carinâ€™ whether Josiah or anybody understood me
or not. I knew the Lord understood me, and I knew what I felt in my own
mind, and I didnâ€™t much care for any thing else. Wimmen do have such
spells. They get fairly wore out a tryinâ€™ to express what they feel in
their souls to a gain-sayinâ€™ world, and have that world yell out at â€˜em,
NA
from the very depths of her lovinâ€™ little soul, she wus pure womanly,
affectionate, earnest, tender-hearted, good; and, if anybody tells me
she wuznâ€™t, Iâ€™ll know the reason why.
But, while I wus a reveryinâ€™ this, my Josiah spoke out aginâ€™, and
says,--
â€œInfluence the world through your child, Cicely! influence him, and let
him influence the world. Let him make the world better and purer by your
NA
â€œWhy not use that influence _now, myself_? I have it here right in my
heart, all that I could hope to teach to my boy, at the best. And why
wait, and set my hopes of influencing the world through him, when a
thousand things may happen to weaken that influence, and death and
change may destroy it? Why, my one great fear and dread is, that my
boy will be led away by other, stronger influences than mine,--the
temptations that have overthrown so many other children of prayer--how
dare I hope that my boy will withstand them? And death may claim him
before he could bear my influence to the world. Why not use it now,
myself, to help him, and other mothersâ€™ boys? If it is, as you say, an
experiment, why not let mothers try it? It could not do any harm; and it
would ease our poor, anxious hearts some, to make the effort, even if
it proved useless. No one can have a deeper interest in the childrenâ€™s
welfare than their mothers. Would they be apt to do any thing to harm
NA
And then I spoke up, entirely unbeknown to myself, and says,--
â€œSelfishness has had its way for years and years in politics, and now

And then I spoke right up, for I canâ€™t stand too much foolishness at one
time from man or woman; and I says,--
â€œIâ€™d love to have you speak up, Josiah Allen, and tell me how wimmen
would go to work to get any lower in the opinion of men; how they could
get into any lower grade of society than they are minglinâ€™ with now.
They are ranked now by the laws of the United States, and the will of
men, with idiots, lunatics, and criminals. And how pretty it looks for
you men to try to scare us, and make us think there is a lower class we
could get into! _There hainâ€™t any lower class that we can get into_ than
the ones we are in now; and you know it, Josiah Allen. And you shaâ€™nâ€™t

He quailed. He knew there wuznâ€™t. He knew he had said it to scare us,
Cicely and me, and he felt considerable meachinâ€™ to think he had got
found out in it. But he went on in ruther of a meek tone,--

[Illustration: CICELY AND HER PEERS.]
And she kepâ€™ right on with her tender, earnest voice, and her eyes a
shininâ€™ like stars,--
â€œHave I not a right to help him? Is he not _my_ child? Did not God give
me a _right_ to him, when I went down into the darkness with God alone,
and a soul was given into my hands? Did I not suffer for him? Have I not
been blessed in him? Why, his little hands held me back from the gates
of death. By all the rights of heavenliest joy and deepest agony--is he
not _mine_? Have I not a _right_ to help him in his future?
â€œNow I hold him in my arms, my flesh, my blood, my life. I hold him on
my heart now: he is _mine_. I can shield him from danger: if he should
fall into the flames, I could reach in after him, and die with him, or
save him. God and man give me that right now: I do not have to ask for
it.
â€œBut in a few years he will go out from me, carrying my own life with
him, my heart will go with him, to joy or to death. He will go out into
dangers a thousand-fold worse than death,--dangers made respectable and
legal,--and I canâ€™t help him.
â€œ_I_ his mother, who would die for him any hour--I must stand with my
eyes open, but my hands bound, and see him rushing headlong into flames
tenfold hotter than fire; see him on the brink of earthly and eternal
ruin, and canâ€™t reach out my hand to hold him back. My _boy!_ My _own!_

And she got up, and walked the room back and forth, and says,--
â€œHow can I bear the thought of it? How can I live and endure it? And how

And her eyes looked so big and bright, and that spot of red would look
so bright on her white cheeks, that I would get skairt. And Iâ€™d try to
sooth her down, and talk gentle to her. And I says,--

But she says, â€œWhat will hope do for me when my boy is lost? I want to

It did beat all, as I told Josiah, out to one side, to see such hefty
principles and emotions in such a little body. Why, she didnâ€™t weigh
much over 90, if she did any.
NA
And I says in the same low, deep tones, â€œAll men hainâ€™t like George
NA
And he went out. But it did beat all, how that little thing, when she
stood ready, seeminâ€™ly, to tackle the nation--Iâ€™ve seen her jump up in a
chair, afraid of a mice. The idee of anybody beinâ€™ afraid of a mice, and
ready to tackle the Constitution!
And sheâ€™d blush up red as a rosy if a stranger would speak to her. But
she would fight the hull nation for her boy.
And Iâ€™d try to sooth her (for that red spot on her cheeks skairt me, and
I foreboded about her). I said to her after Josiah went out, a holdinâ€™
her little hot hands in mine,--for sometimes her hands would be hot and
feverish, and then, agin, like two snowflakes,--
â€œCicely, womenâ€™s voting on intemperance would, as your uncle Josiah
says, be a experiment. I candidly think and believe that it would be
a good thing,--a blessinâ€™ to the youth of the land, a comfort to the
females, and no harm to the males. But, after all, we donâ€™t know what it

â€˜em, that I declare forâ€™t, if I didnâ€™t almost think she _did_ know. I
says to myself,--
â€œSheâ€™s so sweet and unselfish and good, that I believe sheâ€™s more than
half-ways into heaven now. The Holy Scriptures, that I believe in, says,
â€˜Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.â€™ And it donâ€™t
say where they shall see Him, or when. And it donâ€™t say that the light
that fell from on high upon the blessed mother of our Lord, shall never
fall again on other heart-broken mothers, on other pure souls beloved of

And it is the honest truth, that it would not have surprised me much
sometimes, as she wus settinâ€™ in the twilight with the boy in her arms,
if I had seen a halo round her head; and so I told Josiah one night,
after she had been a settinâ€™ there a holdinâ€™ the boy, and a singinâ€™ low
to him,--
  â€œâ€˜A charge to keep I have,--
    A God to glorify;
  A never-dying soul to save,
NA
It wuznâ€™t _her_ soul she wus a thinkinâ€™ of, I knew. She didnâ€™t think of
herself: she never did.
And after she went to bed, I mentioned the halo. And Josiah asked what
that was. And I told him it was â€œthe inner glory that shines out from a

NA
Wall, the very next day, when Josiah came from Jonesville,--he had been
to mill,--he brought Cicely a letter from her aunt Mary. She wanted
her to come on at once; for her daughter, who wus a runninâ€™ down, wus
supposed to be a runninâ€™ faster than she had run. And her aunt Mary
was goinâ€™ to start for the Michigan very soon,--as soon as she got well
enough: she wasnâ€™t feelinâ€™ well when she wrote. And she wanted Cicely to
come at once.
So she went the next day, but promised that jest as quick as she got
through visitinâ€™ her aunt and her other relations there, she would come
back here.
So she went; and I missed her dretfully, and should have missed her more
if it hadnâ€™t been for the state my companion returned in after he had
carried Cicely to the train.
He come home rampant with a new idee. All wrought up about goinâ€™ into
politics. He broached the subject to me before he onharnessed, hitchinâ€™
the old mair for the purpose. He wanted to be United-States senator. He
said he thought the nation needed him.

He riz right up, and hollered at me,--

And he started for the barn, almost on the run.
But I didnâ€™t care. I wus bound to break up this idee of hisen at once.
If I hadnâ€™t been, I shouldnâ€™t have mentioned the free pass to him. For
it is a subject so gaulinâ€™ to him, that I never allude to it only in
cases of extreme danger and peril, or uncommon high-headedness.
Now I have mentioned it, I donâ€™t know but it will be expected of me to
tell about this pass of hisen. But, if I do, it mustnâ€™t go no further;
for Josiah would be mad, mad as a hen, if he knew I told about it.
I will relate the history in another epistol.
CHAPTER IV.
This free pass of Josiah Allenâ€™s wus indeed a strange incident, and it
made sights and sights of talk.
But of course there wus considerable lyinâ€™ about it, as you know the way
is. Why, it does beat all how stories will grow.
Why, when I hear a story nowadays, I always allow a full half for
shrinkage, and sometimes three-quarters; and a good many times that
hainâ€™t enough. Such awful lyinâ€™ times! It duz beat all.
But about this strange thing that took place and happened, I will
proceed and relate the plain and unvarnished history of it. And what I
set down in this epistol, you can depend upon. It is the plain truth,
entirely unvarnished: not a mite of varnish will there be on it.
A little over two years ago Josiah Allen, my companion, had a
opportunity to buy a wood-lot cheap. It wus about a mild and a half from
here, and one side of the lot run along by the side of the railroad. A
Irishman had owned it previous and prior to this time, and had built a
little shanty on it, and a pig-pen. But times got hard, the pig died,
and owing to that, and other financikal difficulties, the Irishman had
to sell the place, â€œten acres more or less, runninâ€™ up to a stake, and
NA
[Illustration: JOSIAHâ€™S WOOD-LOT.]
Wall, he beset my companion Josiah to buy it; and as he had plenty of
money in the Jonesville bank to pay for it, and the wood on our wood-lot
wus gettinâ€™ pretty well thinned out, I didnâ€™t make no objection to the
enterprize, but, on the other hand, I encouraged him in it. And so he
made the bargain with him, the deed wus made out, the Irishman paid. And
Josiah put a lot of wood-choppers in there to work; and they cut, and
drawed the wood to Jonesville, and made money. Made more than enough the
first six months to pay for the expenditure and outlay of money for the
lot.
He did well. And he calculated to do still better; for he said the place
beinâ€™ so near Jonesville, he laid out, after he had got the wood off,
and sold it, and kepâ€™ what he wanted, he calculated and laid out to sell
the place for twice what he give for it. Josiah Allen hainâ€™t nobodyâ€™s
fool in a bargain, a good deal of the time he hainâ€™t. He knows how to
make good calculations a good deal of the time. He thought somebody
would want the place to build on.
Wall, I asked him one day what he laid out to do with the shanty and
the pig-pen that wus on it. The pig-pen wus right by the side of the
railroad-track.
And he said he laid out to tear â€˜em down, and draw the lumber home: he
said the boards would come handy to use about the premises.
Wall, I told him I thought that would be a good plan, or words to that
effect. I canâ€™t remember the exact words I used, not expectinâ€™ that I
would ever have to remember back, and lay â€˜em to heart. Which I should
not had it not been for the strange and singular things that occurred
and took place afterwards.
Then I asked my companion, if I remember rightly, â€œWhen he laid out
NA
amongst â€˜em, and I wanted a couple to lay down from the back-door to the
pump. The old ones wus gettinâ€™ all cracked up and broke in spots.
And he said he should draw â€˜em up the first day he could spare the team.
Wall, this wus along in the first week in April that we had this talk:
warm and pleasant the weather wus, exceedingly so, for the time of year.
And I proposed to him that we should have the children come home on the
8th of April, which wus Thomas J.â€™s birthday, and have as nice a dinner
as we could get, and buy a handsome present for him. And Josiah was very
agreeable to the idee (for when did a man ever look scornfully on the
idee of a good dinner?).
And so the next day I went to work, and cooked up every thing I could
think of that would be good. I made cakes of all kinds, and tarts, and
jellys. And I wus goinâ€™ to have spring lamb and a chicken-pie (a layer
of chicken, and a layer of oysters. I can make a chicken-pie that will
melt in your mouth, though I am fur from beinâ€™ the one that ort to say
it); and I wus goinâ€™ to have a baked fowl, and vegetables of all kinds,
and every thing else I could think of that wus good. And I baked a large
NA
letters, and the dates of his birth and the present date on each side of
it.
I do well by the children, Josiah says I do; and they see it now, the
children do; they see it plainer every day, they say they do. They say,
that since they have gone out into the world more, and seen more of the
coldness and selfishness of the world, they appreciate more and more the
faithful affection of her whose name wus once Smith.
Yes, they like me better and better every year, they say they do.
And they treat me pretty, dretful pretty. I donâ€™t want to be treated
prettier by anybody than the children treat me.
And their affectionate devotion pays me, it pays me richly, for all the
care and anxiety they caused me. There hainâ€™t no paymaster like Love: he
pays the best wages, and the most satisfyinâ€™, of anybody I ever see. But
I am a eppisodinâ€™, and to resoom and continue on.
Wall! the dinner passed off perfectly delightful and agreeable. The
children and Josiah eat as if--Wall, suffice it to say, the way they eat
wus a great compliment to the cook, and I took it so.
Thomas J. wus highly delighted with his presents. I got him a nice white
willow rockinâ€™-chair, with red ribbons run all round the back, and bows
of the same on top, and a red cushion,--a soft feather cushion that I
made myself for it, covered with crimson rep (wool goods, very nice).
Why, the cushion cost me above 60 cents, besides my work and the
feathers.
Josiah proposed to get him a acordeun, but I talked him out of that; and
then he wanted to get him a bright blue necktie. But I perswaided him
NA
 painted on it; and I urged him to give him that, with ten new silver
NA
 And Josiah consented after a parlay. Why, the chair I give him cost
about as much as that; and it wuznâ€™t none too good, not at all.
Wall, he had a lovely day. And what made it pleasanter, we had a
prospect of havinâ€™ another jest as good. For in about 2 monthsâ€™ time it
would be Tirzahâ€™s Annâ€™s birthday; and we both told her, Josiah and me,
both did, that she must get ready for jest another such a time. For we
laid out to treat â€˜em both alike (which is both Christian and common
sense). And we told â€˜em they must all be ready to come home that day,
Providence and the weather permittinâ€™.
Wall, it wus so awful pleasant when the children got ready to go home,
that Josiah proposed that he and me should go along to Jonesville with
â€˜em, and carry little Samantha Joe. And I wus very agreeable to the
idee, beinâ€™ a little tired, and thinkinâ€™ such a ride would be both
restful and refreshinâ€™.
And, oh! how beautiful every thing looked as we rode along! The sun wus
goinâ€™ down in glory; and Jonesville layinâ€™ to the west of us, we seemed
to be a ridinâ€™ along right into that glory--right towards them golden
palaces, and towers of splendor, that riz up from the sea of gold. And
behind them shininâ€™ towers wus shadowy mountain ranges of softest color,
that melted up into the tender blue of the April sky. And right in the
east a full moon wuz sailinâ€™, lookinâ€™ down tenderly on Josiah and me and
the babe--and Jonesville and the world. And the comet sot there up in
the sky like a silent and shininâ€™ mystery.
The babeâ€™s eyes looked big and dreamy and thoughtful. She has got the
beautifulest eyes, little Samantha Joe has. You can look down deep into
â€˜em, and see yourself in â€˜em; but, beyond yourself, what is it you can
see? I canâ€™t tell, nor nobody. The ellusive, wonderful beauty that lays
in the innocent baby eyes of little Samantha Joe. The sweet, fur-off
look, as if she wus a lookinâ€™ right through this world into a fairer and
more peaceful one.
[Illustration: GODâ€™S COMMA.]
And how smart they be, who can answer their questioning,--questioninâ€™
about every thing. Nobody canâ€™t--Josiah canâ€™t, nor I, nor nobody. Pretty

NA
Now, jest see how deep that wuz, and beautiful, very. The heavens wuz
full of the writinâ€™ of God, writinâ€™ we canâ€™t read yet, and translate
into our coarser language; and she, with her deep, beautiful eyes,
a readinâ€™ it jest as plain as print, and puttinâ€™ in all the marks of
punctuation. Readinâ€™ the marvellous poem of glory, with its tremblinâ€™
pause of flame.
Josiah says, it is because she couldnâ€™t say comet; but I know better.
NA
And he had to gin it up that it was. And in a minute or two she says
agin,--
NA
Now hear that, how deep that wuz. Who could answer that question? I
couldnâ€™t, nor Josiah couldnâ€™t. Nor the wisest philosopher that
ever walked the earth, not one of â€˜em. From them that kept their
night-watches on the newly built pyramids, to the astronimers of to-day
who are spending their lives in the study of the heavens. If every one
of them learned men of the world, livinâ€™ and dead, if they all stood in
rows in our door-yard in front of little Samantha Joe, they would have
to bow their haughty heads before her, and put their finger on their
lips. Them lips could say very large words in every language under the
sun; but they couldnâ€™t answer my babyâ€™s question, not one of â€˜em.
But I am eppisodinâ€™ fearfully, fearfully; and to resoom.
We left the children and the babe safe in their respective housenâ€™, and
happy; and we went on placidly to Jonesville, got our usual groceries,
and stopped to the post-office. Josiah went into the office, and come

I thought it had a sort of a queer look, but I didnâ€™t say nothinâ€™. And
it beinâ€™ sort oâ€™ darkish, he didnâ€™t try to open it till we got home.

And he says, â€œI donâ€™t know: the postmaster had a awful time a tryinâ€™ to

of the bad writinâ€™ of the letter he had got, off onto his companion, as
the way of male pardners is, he felt easy and comfortable in his mind,
and talked agreeable all the way home, and affectionate, some.
Wall, we got home; and I lit a light, and fixed the fire so it burnt
bright and clear. And I drawed up a stand in front of the fire, with
a bright crimson spread on it, for the lamp; and I put Josiahâ€™s
rockinâ€™-chair and mine, one on each side of it; and put Josiahâ€™s
slippers in front of the hearth to warm. And then I took my
knittinâ€™-work, and went to knittinâ€™; and by that time Josiah had got his
barn-chores all done, and come in.
[Illustration: JOSIAH READING THE LETTER.]
And the very first thing he did after he come in, and drawed off his
boots, and wondered â€œwhy under the gracious heavens it was, that the

its usual place in the closet, only a coat had got hung up over it so he
couldnâ€™t see it for half a minute.
And after he had his warm slippers on, and got sot down in his
easy-chair opposite to his beloved companion, he grew calmer again, and
more placider, and drawed out that letter from his pocket.
And I sot there a knittinâ€™, and a watchinâ€™ my companionâ€™s face at the
same time; and I see that as he read the letter, he looked smut, and
sort oâ€™ wonder-struck: and says I,--

drawed up to the house, Josiah Allen dressed up, and sot off for

not tickleder.

for a number of minutes; and then he handed it back to me, and I put it

every minute,--
â€œI am pretty-lookinâ€™. I am what you might call a orniment to any car

dressy. And Iâ€™m what you might call a influential man, and I sâ€™pose the
railroad-men want to keep the right side of me. And they have took the
right way to do it. I shall speak well of â€˜em as long as I can ride
free. And, oh! what solid comfort I shall take, Samantha, a ridinâ€™ on
that pass! I calculate to see the world now. And there is nothinâ€™ under
the sun to hender you from goinâ€™ with me. As long as you are the wife of
such a influential and popular man as I be, it donâ€™t look well for you
to go a mopeinâ€™ along afoot, or with the old mare. We will ride in the

Says he, for he wus that proud and excited that you couldnâ€™t stop him
nohow,--
â€œIt will be a dretful savinâ€™ of money, but that hainâ€™t what I think of
the most. It is the honor they are a heapinâ€™ onto me. To think that they
think so much of me, set such a store by me, and look up to me so, that
they send me a free pass without my makinâ€™ a move to ask for it. Why, it

And so he would go on from hour to hour, and from day to day; and I wus
that dumbfoundered and wonderinâ€™ about it, that I couldnâ€™t for my life
tell what to think of it. It worried me.
But from that day Josiah Allen rode on that pass, every chance he got.
Why, he went to the Ohio on it, on a visit to his first wiveâ€™s sister;
and he went to Michigan on it, and to the South, and everywhere he could
think of. Why, he fairly hunted up relations on it, and I told him so.
And after he got â€˜em hunted up, heâ€™d take them onto that pass, and ride
round with â€˜em on it.
And he told every one of â€˜em, he told everybody, that he thought as much
agin of the honor as he did of the money. It showed that he wus thought
so much of, not only in Jonesville, but the world at large.
Why, he took such solid comfort in it, that it did honestly seem as
if he grew fat, he wus so puffed up by it, and proud. And some of the
neighbors that he boasted so before, wus eat up with envy, and seemed
mad to think he had come to such honor, and they hadnâ€™t. But the
madder they acted, the tickleder he seemed, and more prouder, and
high-headeder.
But I could not feel so. I felt that there wus sunthinâ€™ strange and
curius about it. And it wus very, very seldom that Josiah could get me
to ride on it. Though I did take a few short journeys on it, to please
him. But I felt sort oâ€™ uneasy while I was a ridinâ€™ on it, same as you
feel when you are goinâ€™ up-hill with a heavy load and a little horse.
You kinder stand on your feet, and lean forward, as if your beinâ€™
oncomfortable, and standinâ€™ up, helped the horse some.
I had a good deal of that restless feelinâ€™, and oneasy. And as I told
Josiah time and time again, â€œthat for stiddy ridinâ€™ I preferred a mare

Wall, it run along for a year; and Josiah said he sâ€™posed heâ€™d have to
write on, and get the pass renewed. As near as he could make out, it
run out about the 4th day of April. So he wrote down to the head one in
New-York village; and the answer came back by return mail, and wrote in
plain writinâ€™ so we could read it.
It seemed there wus a mistake. It wuznâ€™t a free pass, it wus a order for
Josiah Allen to remove a pig-pen from his place on the railroad-track
within three days.
There it wuz, a order to remove a nuisence; and Josiah Allen had been a
ridinâ€™ on it for a year, with pride in his mean, and haughtiness in his
demeanor.
Wall, I never see a man more mortified and cut up than Josiah Allen
wuz. If he hadnâ€™t boasted so over its beinâ€™ gin to him on account of his
beinâ€™ so smart and popular and etcetery, he wouldnâ€™t have felt so cut
up. But as it was, it bowed down his bald head into the dust (allegory).
But he didnâ€™t stay bowed down for any length of time: truly, men are
constituted in such a way that mortification donâ€™t show on â€˜em for any
length of time.
But it made sights and sights of talk in Jonesville. The Jonesvillians
made sights and sights of fun of him, poked fun at him, and snickered. I
myself didnâ€™t say much: it hainâ€™t my way. I merely says this: says I,--
â€œYou thought you wus so awful popular, Josiah Allen, mebby you wonâ€™t go

CHAPTER V.
Josiah is as kind-hearted a man as was ever made. And he loves me with
a devotion, that though hidden sometimes, like volcanic fires, and other
married menâ€™s affections for their wives, yet it bursts out occasionally
in spurts and jets of unexpected tenderness.
Now, the very next morninâ€™ after Cicely left for her aunt Maryâ€™s, he
gave me a flaming proof of that hidden fire that burns but donâ€™t consume
him.
A agent come to our dwelling, and with the bland and amiable air of
their sect, asked me,--
NA
I was favorable to the idee, and showed it by my looks and words; but
Josiah wus awful set against it. And the more favorable I talked about
it, the more horrow-struck and skairt Josiah Allen looked. And finally
he got behind the agent, and winked at me, and made motions for me to
foller him into the buttery. He wunk several times before I paid much
attention to â€˜em; but finally, the winks grew so violent, and the
motions so imperious, yet clever, that I got up, and follered him into
the buttery. He shet the door, and stood with his back against it; and
says to me, with his voice fairly tremblinâ€™ with his emotions,--
NA
NA
NA
on one of â€˜em! It skairs me most to death to see a boy ride â€˜em; and at
your age, and with your rheumatiz, youâ€™d get throwed, and get your neck
NA
more stylish, and new-fangled than the old mair, Iâ€™d ruther buy you a

NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, and Iâ€™ll get you one ruther than have you a ridinâ€™ round the
NA
His tender thoughtfulness touched my heart, and I explained to him all
about â€˜em. He thought it was some kind of a bycicle. And he brightened
up, and didnâ€™t make no objections to my gettinâ€™ one.
Wall, that very afternoon he went to Jonesville, and come home, as I
said, all rousted up about beinâ€™ a senator. I sâ€™pose Elburtusâ€™es beinâ€™
there, and talkinâ€™ so much on politics, had kinder sot him to thinkinâ€™
on it. Anyway, he come home from Jonesville perfectly rampant with the
idee of beinâ€™ United-States senator. â€œHe said he had been approached on

He said it in that sort of a haughty, high-headed way, such as men will
sometimes assume when they think they have had some high honors heaped
onto â€˜em.

 says he, â€œI am bound to be senator. Josiah Allen, M.C., will probable be
NA
Says I coldly, â€œYou know you canâ€™t run. You are as lame as you can be.
NA
Says he, â€œI mean runninâ€™ with political legs--and I do want to be a
senator, Samantha. I want to, like a dog, I want the money there is in
it, and I want the honor. You know they have elected me path-master,
but I hainâ€™t a goinâ€™ to accept it. I tell you, when anybody gets into
political life, ambition rousts up in â€˜em: path-master donâ€™t satisfy
me. I want to be senator: I want to, like a dog. And I donâ€™t lay out to
NA
NA
â€œNo: I have laid my plans, and laid â€˜em careful. The relation on your
side was too willinâ€™, and too clever. And witnessinâ€™ his campaign has
learnt me some deep lessons. I watched the rocks he hit aginst; and I
have laid my plans, and laid â€˜em careful. I am going to act offish.
I feel that offishness is my strong holt--and endearinâ€™ myself to the
masses. Educatinâ€™ public sentiment up to lovinâ€™ me, and urginâ€™ me not to
be so offish, and to obleege â€˜em by takinâ€™ a office--them is my 2 strong
holts. If I can only hang back, and act onwillinâ€™, and get the masses
fierce to elect me--why, Iâ€™m made. And then, Iâ€™ve got a plan in my
NA
I groaned, in spite of myself.
â€œI have got a plan in my head, that, if every other plan fails, will

Oh! how that oath grated against my nerve! And how I hung back from this
idee! I am one that looks ahead. And I says in firm tones,--
â€œYou never would get the nomination, Josiah Allen! And if you did, you

NA
ceilinâ€™, as if wires wus liable to be let down anywhere through the
plasterinâ€™.
NA
NA
NA
that I hainâ€™t goinâ€™ to give my consent to have you go into any thing
NA
Says he, â€œI donâ€™t know but my age is as good a age to break my neck in
NA
NA
I will never give my consent to have you plunge into such dangerous
enterprizes. And talkinâ€™ about pullinâ€™ wires sounds dangerous: it sounds
like a circus, somehow; and how would _you_, with your back, look and
NA
â€œOh, you donâ€™t understand, Samantha! the wires hainâ€™t pulled in that
NA
NA
NA
I knew the size and strength of his mind, jest as well as if I had took
it out of his head, and weighed it on the steelyards. It was _not_ over
and above large. I knew it; and he knew that I knew it, because I have
had to sometimes, in the cause of Right, remind him of it. But he knows
that my love for him towers up like a dromedary, and moves off through
life as stately as she duz--the dromedary. Josiah was my choice out of a
world full of men. I love Josiah Allen. But to resoom and continue on.
NA
puttinâ€™ his head on one side, and lookinâ€™ shrewdly up at the stove-pipe,
NA
Says I, â€œI guess you would run more like a lame hen than a Stalwart or
NA
they wus half snails, and half Times in the primers, maybe you could get
NA
â€œI should think, Samantha Allen, in such a time as this, you would act
like a rational beinâ€™. Iâ€™ll be hanged if I know what side to go on to
NA
Says I, â€œJosiah Allen, hainâ€™t you got any principle? Donâ€™t you _know_
NA
â€œWhy, yes, I sâ€™pose I know as near as men in gineral. Iâ€™m a Democrat in
times of peace. But it is human nater, to want to be on the side that
NA
NA
NA
I sithed agin, and kepâ€™ sithinâ€™.
Says I, â€œIt is bad enough, Josiah Allen, to have you talk about runninâ€™
for senator, and pullinâ€™ wires, and etcetery. But, oh, oh! my agony to
NA
â€œI have got as much as most political men, and youâ€™ll find it out so,
NA
My groans touched his heart--that man loves me.
â€œI am goinâ€™ to work as they all do. But wimmen hainâ€™t no heads for
business, and I always said so. They donâ€™t look out for the profits of
NA
I didnâ€™t say nothinâ€™ only my sithes, but they spoke volumes to any one
who understood their language. But anon, or mebby before,--I hadnâ€™t kepâ€™
any particular account of time, but I think it wus about anon,--when
another thought struck me so, right in my breast, that it most knocked
me over. It hanted me all the rest of that day: and all that night I lay
awake and worried, and Iâ€™d sithe, and sposen the case; and then Iâ€™d turn
over, and sposen the case, and sithe.
Sposen he would be elected--I didnâ€™t really think he would, but
I couldnâ€™t for my life help sposen. Sposen he would have to go to
Washington. I knew strange things took place in politics. Strange men
run, and run fur: some on â€˜em run clear to Washington. Mebby he would.
Oh! how I groaned at the idee!
I thought of the awfulness of that place as I had heard it described
upon to me; and then I thought of the weakness of men, and their
liability to be led astray. I thought of the powerful blasts of
temptation that blowed through them broad streets, and the small size of
my pardner, and the light weight of his bones and principles.
And I felt, if things wuz as they had been depictered to me, he
would (in a moral sense) be lifted right up, and blowed away--bones,
principles, and all. And I trembled.
At last the idee knocked so firm aginst the door of my heart, that I had
to let it in. That I _must_, I _must_ go to Washington, as a forerunner
of Josiah. I must go ahead of him, and look round, and see if my Josiah
could pass through with no smell of fire on his overcoat--if there wuz
any possibility of it. If there wuz, why, I should stand still, and let
things take their course. But if my worst apprehensions wuz realized,
if I see that it was a place where my pardner would lose all the modest
worth and winninâ€™ qualities that first endeared him to me--why, I would
come home, and throw all my powerful influence and weight into the
scales, and turn â€˜em round.
[Illustration: JOSIAH BEING BLOWN AWAY.]
Of course, I felt that I should have to make some pretext about goinâ€™:
for though I wus as innocent as a babe of wantinâ€™ to do so, I felt that
he would think he wus beinâ€™ domineered over by me. Men are so sort oâ€™
high-headed and haughty about some things! But I felt I could make a
pretext of George Washington. That dear old martyr! I felt truly I would
love to weep upon his tomb.
And so I told Josiah the next morninâ€™, for I thought I would tackle the
subject at once. And he says,--
NA
Says I, â€œThe day of love and gratitude never fades into night, Josiah
Allen: the sun of gratitude never goes down; it shines on that tomb
NA
â€œWall, wall! go and weep on it if you want to. But Iâ€™ll bet half a cent
that youâ€™ll cry onto the ice-house, as Iâ€™ve heard of other wimmenâ€™s
NA
â€œYou neednâ€™t worry, Josiah Allen. I shall cry at the right time, and in

I always was one to tackle hard jobs immejutly and to once, soâ€™s to get
â€˜em offenâ€™ my mind.
NA
NA
NA
the chores, and work for herself; they are goinâ€™ to be married before
long: and Iâ€™ll give her some rolls, and let her spin some yarn for
NA
â€œHow long do you sâ€™pose youâ€™ll be gone? She hainâ€™t no cook. Iâ€™d as lives
NA
â€œYour pardner will fry up 2 pans full before she goes, Josiah; and I
NA
â€œOh, well! then I guess I can stand it. But you had better make some
mince-pies ahead, and other kinds of pies, and some fruit-cake, and
cookies, and tarts, and things: it is always best to be on the safe
NA
So it wus agreed on,--that I should fill two cubbard shelves full of
provisions, to help him endure my absence.
I wus some in hopes that he might give up the idee of beinâ€™
United-States senator, and I might have rest from my tower; for I
dreaded, oh, how I dreaded, the job! But as day by day passed, he grew
more and more rampant with the idee. He talked about it all the time
daytimes; and in the night I could hear him murmur to himself,--
NA
And once I see it in his account-book, â€œOld Peedick debtor to two
NA
And he talked sights, and sights, about what he wus goinâ€™ to do when
he got to Washington, D.C.--what great things he wus goinâ€™ to do. And I
would get wore out, and say to him,--
NA
â€œOh! you neednâ€™t worry. I can get there easy enough. I sâ€™pose I shall
have to work hard jest as they all do. But as I told you before,
if every thing else fails, I have got a grand plan to fall back
on--sunthinâ€™ new and uneek. Josiah Allen is nobodyâ€™s fool, and the
NA
Then, oh, how I urged him to tell his plan to his lovinâ€™ pardner! but he
_wouldnâ€™t tell_.
But hours and hours would he spend, a tellinâ€™ me what great things he
wus goinâ€™ to do when he got to Washington.
Says he, â€œThere is one thing about it. When I get to be United-States
senator, uncle Nate Gowdey shall be promoted to some high and
NA
NA
â€œYes, mom, without thinkinâ€™ a thing about it. I am bound to help the
NA
NA
NA
â€œOh, yes! Iâ€™d have him pass a examination jest as the New-York aldermen
do, or the civil-service men. Iâ€™d say to him, â€˜Be you uncle Nate
Gowdey?â€™
â€œâ€˜Yes.â€™
â€œâ€˜How long have you been uncle Nate Gowdey?â€™
â€œAnd heâ€™d answer; and Iâ€™d say,--
â€œâ€˜How long do you calculate to be uncle Nate?â€™
â€œAnd heâ€™ll tell; and then Iâ€™ll say,--
â€œâ€˜Enough: I see you have all the qualifications for office. You are
NA
I groaned. But he kepâ€™ on complacently, â€œI am goinâ€™ to help the ones
that elect me, sink or swim; and I calculate to make money out of the
project,--money and honor. And I shall do a big work there,--there
hainâ€™t no doubt of it.
â€œNow, there is political economy. I shall go in strong for that. I shall
say right to Congress, the first speech I make to it, I shall say, that
there is too much money spent now to hire votes with; and I shall prove
it right out, that we can get votes cheaper if we senators all join in
together, and put our feet right down that we wonâ€™t pay only jest so
much for a vote. But as long as one man is willinâ€™ to pay high, why,
everybody else has got to foller suit. And there hainâ€™t no economy in
it, not a mite.
â€œThen, there is the canal question. Iâ€™ll make a thorough end of that.
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œThat is because you hainâ€™t a man. You hainâ€™t got the mind to grasp
these big questions. The corruption of the canal means that the bottom
of the canal is all covered with dead cats and things; and it ort to be
seen to, by men that is capable of seeinâ€™ to such things. It ort to be
NA
proudly.
â€œThen, there is the Star Route. Nothinâ€™ but foolishness from beginninâ€™
to end. They might have known they couldnâ€™t make any road through the
stars. Why, the very Bible is agin it. The ground is good enough for me,
and for any other solid man. It is some visionary chap that begun it in
the first place. Nothinâ€™ but dumb foolishness; and so uncle Nate Gowdey
said it was. We got to talkinâ€™ about it yesterday, and he said it was a
pity wimmin couldnâ€™t vote on it. He said that would be jest about what
they would be likely to vote for.
â€œHe is a smart old feller, uncle Nate is, for a man of his age. He
talked awful smart about wimminâ€™s votinâ€™. He said any man was a fool to
think that a woman would ever have the requisit grasp of intellect,
and the knowledge of public affairs, that would render her a competent
voter.
[Illustration: JOSIAHâ€™s STAR ROUTE.]
â€œI tell you, you have got to _understand_ things in order to tackle
politicks. Politicks takes deep study.
â€œNow, there is the tariff question, and the revenue. I shall most
NA
NA
â€œOh, wall! a woman most probable couldnâ€™t understand it. But I shall
NA
NA
â€œOh, keep a askinâ€™, and a nagginâ€™! That is what wears out us public
men,--wimminâ€™s questioninâ€™. It hainâ€™t so much the public duties we
have to perform that ages us, and wears us out before our time,--it is
womanâ€™s weak curiosity on public topics, that her mind is too feeble to
NA
NA
NA
â€œWall, I know what starvation means, and I know what vittles means, and
NA
Instinctively I hung on the teakettle. And as Josiah see me pare the
potatoes, and grind the coffee, and pound the steak, he grew very
pleasant again in his demeanor; and says he,--
â€œThere will be some abuses reformed when I get to Washington, D.C.;
and you and the nation will see that there will. Now, there is the
civil-service law: Uncle Nate and I wus a talkinâ€™ about it yesterday. It
is jest what we need. Why, as uncle Nate said, hired men hainâ€™t civil at
all, nor hired girls either. You hire â€˜em to serve you, and to serve you
civil; and they are jest as dumb uppish and impudent as they can be. And
NA
â€œWhy, uncle Nate said when he went to the Ohio, last fall, he stayed
over night to Cleveland, and the hotel-clerk sassed him, jest because he
wanted to blow out his light: he wanted uncle Nate to turn it off.
â€œAnd uncle Nate jest spoke right up, smart as a whip, and said,
â€˜Old-fashioned ways was good enough for him: blows wus made before
turners, and he should blow it out.â€™ And the hotel-clerk sassed him, and
swore, and threatened to make him leave.
â€œAnd ruther than have a fuss, uncle Nate said he turned it out. But it
rankled, uncle Nate says it did, it rankled deep. And he says he wants
to vote for that special. He says heâ€™d love to make that clerk eat
humble-pie.
â€œUncle Nate is a sound man: his head is level.
â€œAnd good, sound platforms, that is another reform, uncle Nate said we
needed the worst kind, and he hoped I would insist on it when I got to
be senator. He said there was too much talk about â€˜em in the papers, and
too little done about â€˜em. Why, Elam Gowdey, uncle Nateâ€™s youngest boy,
broke down the platform to his barn, and went right down through it,
with a load of hay. And nothinâ€™ but that hay saved his neck from beinâ€™
broke. It spilte one of his horses.
â€œUncle Nate had been urginâ€™ him to fix the platform, or build a new one;
but he was slack. But, as uncle Nate says, if such things are run by
law, they will _have_ to be done.
â€œAnd then, there is another thing uncle Nate and I was talkinâ€™
NA
biscuit--almost spooney.
[Illustration: UNCIVIL SERVICE.]
â€œI shall jest run every poor Irishman and Chinaman out of the country
NA
NA
â€œOh! they are poor. There hainâ€™t no use in our associatinâ€™ with the

â€œWhy, they are heathens, Samantha. What does the United States want with

set the coffee-cups on the table,--â€œâ€˜You shall have the heathen for an
inheritanceâ€™--and â€˜preach the gospel to the heathenâ€™--and â€˜we who were
sometime heathens, but have received lightâ€™? Did not the echo of some
NA
â€œOh, wall! if you are goinâ€™ to quote readinâ€™, why canâ€™t you quote from
â€˜The Worldâ€™? you canâ€™t combine Bible and politics worth a cent. And the
Chinaman works too cheap--are too industrious, and reasonable in their
charges, they hainâ€™t extravagant--and they are too dumb peacible, dumb
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo, it hainâ€™t. They donâ€™t want to vote! They donâ€™t care a cent about
beinâ€™ path-master or President. And I say, that after givinâ€™ a man a
fair trial and a long one, if he wonâ€™t try to buy or sell a vote, it is
a sure sign that he canâ€™t asimulate with Americans, and be one with â€˜em;
that he canâ€™t never be mingled in with â€˜em peacible. And Iâ€™ll bet that
Iâ€™ll start the Catholics out--and the Jews. What under the sun is the
use of havinâ€™ anybody here in America only jest Methodists? That is the
only right way. And if I have my way, Iâ€™ll get rid of â€˜em,--Chinamen,
Irishmen, Catholics,--the hull caboodle of â€˜em. Iâ€™ll jest light â€˜em out
of the country. We can do it too. That big statute in New-York Harbor
of Liberty Enlighteninâ€™ the World, will jest lift her torch up high, and
NA
I sithed low, and says, â€œI never knew that wus what she wus there for.
I sâ€™posed it wus a gift from a land that helped us to liberty and
prosperity when we needed â€˜em as bad as the Irishmen and Chinamen do
to-day; and I sâ€™posed that torch that wus lit for us by othersâ€™ help, we
should be willinâ€™ and glad to have it shine on the dark cross-roads of
NA
â€œWall, it hainâ€™t meant for no such purpose: it is to light up _our_ land
NA
I sithed agin, a sort of a cold sithe, and says,--
â€œI donâ€™t think it looks very well for us New-Englanders a sittinâ€™ round
NA
â€œWall, there hainâ€™t no need of whittlinâ€™ out a stick, and worshipinâ€™ it,
NA
â€œHow are you goinâ€™ to help â€˜em to worship the true God if you send â€˜em
out of the country? Is it for the sake of humanity you drive â€˜em out?
or be you, like the Isrealites of old, a worshipinâ€™ the golden calf of

â€œI hainâ€™t never worshiped _no calf_, Samantha Allen. That would be the

(Josiah wus very lame on his left leg where he had been kicked by a
yearlinâ€™. The spot wus black and blue, but healinâ€™.)
â€œYou have blanketed that calf with thick patriotic excuses; but I fear,
Josiah Allen, that the calf is there.
NA
through the centuries! If every calf should amble right out, marked with
its own name and the name of its owner, what a sight, what a sight it
would be! On one calf, right after its ownerâ€™s name, would be branded,
NA
Josiah squirmed, for I see him, but tried to turn the squirm inâ€™ into a
sickly smile; and he murmured in a meachinâ€™ voice, and with a sheepish
smile,--
â€œâ€˜Hon. Josiah Allen. Fame.â€™ That wouldnâ€™t look so bad on a likely
NA
But I kepâ€™ right on. â€œOn another would be marked, â€˜Wealth.â€™ Very yeller
those calves would be, and a long, long drove of â€˜em.
â€œOn another would be, â€˜Earthly Love.â€™ Middlinâ€™ good-lookinâ€™ calves,
these, and sights of â€˜em. But the mantillys that covered â€˜em would be
all wet and wore with tears.
â€œâ€˜Culture,â€™ â€˜Intellect,â€™ â€˜Refinement.â€™ These calves would march right
along by the side of â€˜Pride,â€™ â€˜Vanity,â€™ â€˜Old Creeds,â€™ â€˜Bigotry,â€™
â€˜Selfishness.â€™ The last-named would be too numerous to count with the
naked eye, and go pushinâ€™ aginst each other, rushinâ€™ right through
NA
NA
up the coffee-pot.
NA
NA
NA
NA
I turned the water off, and mashed â€˜em up, with plenty of cream and
butter; and them, applied to his stomach internally, seemed to sooth
him,--them, and the nice tender steak, and light biscuit, and lemon
puddinâ€™ and coffee, rich and yellow and fragrant.
[Illustration: THE GOLDEN CALVES OF CHRISTIANS.]
He never said a word more about politics till after dinner. But on
risinâ€™ up from the table he told me he had got to go to Jonesville to
get the old mare shod. And I see sadly, as he stood to the lookinâ€™-glass
combinâ€™ out his few hairs, how every by-path his mind sot out on led up
gradually to Washington, D.C. For as he stood there, and spoke of the
mareâ€™s feet, he says,--
â€œThe mare is good enough for Jonesville, Samantha. But when we get
to Washington, we want sunthinâ€™ gayer, more stylish, to ride on.
NA
vest,--â€œI lay out to dress gay, and act gay. I calculate to make a show
for once in my life, and put on style. One thing I am bound on,--I shall

NA
â€œWhy, I shall buy another mare, most probable some gay-colored one, and
hitch it before the old white mare, and drive tantrum. You know, it
NA
I sâ€™pose that is fashionable. But Iâ€™ll be hanged if I should think
it would be easy ridinâ€™ unless you had the teeth down. Dog-carts are
stylish, I hear; but our dog is so dumb lazy, you couldnâ€™t get him to go
NA
[Illustration: JOSIAH DRIVING TANTRUM.]
I groaned, and says, â€œYes, I hainâ€™t no doubt that anybody that sees you
at Washington, will see tantrums, strange tantrums. But you hainâ€™t there
NA
NA
He had actually begun to talk in high-flown, blank verse sort of a way.
NA
Alas! every thought of his heart wus tuned to that one political key.
I mentioned to him that â€œthe bobbin to my sewinâ€™-machine was broke, and
NA
NA
of machines, that makes me think of another thing uncle Nate and I wus
NA
â€œMachine politics, I shaâ€™nâ€™t favor â€˜em. What under the sun do they want
machines to make politics with, when there is plenty of men willinâ€™, and
more than willinâ€™, to make â€˜em? And it is as expensive agin. Machines
NA
NA
â€œI hainâ€™t a swearinâ€™: â€˜tarnationâ€™ hainâ€™t swearinâ€™, nor never wuz. I
NA
NA
He did not demur. But, oh! how I see that immovible setness of his mind!
â€œYes, I will get some. But wonâ€™t it be handy, Samantha, to have free
trade? I shall go for that strong. Why, I can tell you, it will come
handy along in the winter when the hens donâ€™t lay, and we donâ€™t make
butter to turn off--it will come dretful handy to jest hitch up the
mare, and go to the store, and come home with a lot of groceries of all
kinds, and some fresh meat mebby. And mebby some neckties of different
NA
NA
like the idee.
NA
I shook my head 2 or 3 times back and forth. I couldnâ€™t seem to get the
right sense of it. â€œI canâ€™t understand it, Josiah. We heard a good deal
NA
â€œWall, it is, jest that. Free trade is one of the prerequisits of
a senator. Why, what would a man want to be a senator for, if they
NA
NA
â€œYes, I do: but I donâ€™t love her so well as I do myself; it hainâ€™t
NA
NA
dreamily, â€œor where was it? But surely I have heard of such things as
NA
NA
 says he firmly, â€œI calculate I can make jest as much out of her, give me
a chance. Why, I calculate to do jest as they all do. What is the use of
NA
NA
NA
NA
for a clean shirt. And as he opened the bureau-draw, he says,--
â€œAnother thing I shall go for, is abolishinâ€™ lots of the bureaus. Why,
what is the use of any man havinâ€™ more than one bureau? It is nothinâ€™
but nonsense clutterinâ€™ up the house with so many bureaus.
NA
move will be to get â€˜em back agin. Iâ€™ll bet there hainâ€™t a women in the
NA
NA
NA
NA
to me to button up his shirtsleeves, and tie his cravat.
â€œThey are good in their places. But they canâ€™t have, it hainâ€™t in â€˜em to
have, the calm grasp of mind, the deep outlook into the future, that men
have. They canâ€™t weigh things in the firm, careful balences of right and
wrong, and have that deep, masterly knowledge of national affairs that
we men have. They hainâ€™t got the hard horse sense that anybody has got
to have in order to make money out of the nation. They would have some
sentimental subjects up of right or wrong to spend their energies and
their hearts on. Look at Cicely, now. She means well. But what would she
do? What would she make out of votinâ€™? Not a cent. And she never would
think of passinâ€™ laws for her own personal comfort, either. Now, there
is the subsidy bill. Iâ€™ll see that through if I sweat for it.
â€œWhy, it would be worth more than a dollar-bill to me lots of times to
make folks subside. Preachers, now, when they get to goinâ€™ beyond the
20ethly. No preacher has any right to go to wanderinâ€™ round up beyond
them figures in dog-days. And if they could be made to subside when they
had gone fur enough, why, it would be a perfect boon to Jonesville and
the nation.
â€œAnd sewinâ€™-machine agents--and--and wimmen, when they get all excited a
scoldinâ€™, or talkinâ€™ about bonnets, and things. Why! if a man could jest
lift up his hand, and say â€˜Subside!â€™ and then see â€˜em subside--why, I

And I wus so completely fagged out, that I turned the subject completely
round (as I sâ€™posed) by askinâ€™ him if he laid out to sell our apples

wanted to know, for they had bought a new dryinâ€™-machine, and wanted to
make sure of apples ahead.

â€œYes. I wouldnâ€™t tell it out of the family. But you are all in the

My groans was fearful that I groaned at this; but truly, worse was to
come. He looked kinder pitiful at me (he loves me). But yet his love did
not soften the firm resolve that wus spread thick over his linement as
he went on,--
NA
â€œIt seems as if I ought to get a vote for a bushel of apples; but there
is so much iniquity and cheatinâ€™ a goinâ€™ on now in politics, that I may
have to give a bushel and a half, or two bushels: and then, I shall make
up a lot of the smaller ones into hard cider, and use â€˜em to--to advance
the interests of myself and the nation in that way.

â€œThink of the different crimes you commit by that one act, Josiah Allen.

have stole from--steal the first rights of his manhood, his honor,
his patriotism, his duty to God and man. You are a thief of the
Government--thief of God, and right.
â€œThen, _you_ make this man liable to commit any crime: so, if he

Josiah looked quite bad. And he put his hand on his side, and says, â€œMy
heart beats as if it wuz a tryinâ€™ to get out and walk round the room. I

Says I, in a sarcasticker tone than I had used,--
â€œThat is a disease that is very common amongst men, very common, though

your own reel, and you had more right to it than to anybody elseâ€™s.
â€œOh! to think I should have lived to see the hour, to have my companion

â€œWall, dumb it all, do you want me to appear as awkward as a fool? I
have told you more than a dozen times I have _got_ to do as the rest do,

I said no more: but I riz right up, and walked out of the room, with my
head right up in the air, and the strings of my head-dress a floatinâ€™
out behind me; and Iâ€™ll bet there wus indignation in the float of them
strings, and heart-ache, and agony, and--and every thing.
I thought I had convinced him, and hadnâ€™t. I felt as if I must sink. You
know, that is all a woman can do--to sink. She canâ€™t do any thing
else in a helpful way when her beloved companion hangs over political
abysses. She canâ€™t reach out her lovinâ€™ hand, and help stiddy him; she
canâ€™t do nothinâ€™ only jest sink. And what made it more curious, these
despairinâ€™ thoughts come to me as I stood by the sink, washinâ€™ my
dinner-dishes. But anon (I know it wus jest anon, for the water wus
bileinâ€™ hot when I turned it out of the kettle, and it scalded my hands,
onbeknown to me, as I washed out my sass-plates) this thought gripped
holt of me, right in front of the sink,--
â€œJosiah Allenâ€™s wife, you must _not_ sink. You _must_ keep up. If you
have no power to help your pardner to patriotism and honor, you can, if
your worst fears are realized, try to keep him to home. For if his acts
and words are like these in Jonesville, what will they be in Washington,
D.C., if that place is all it has been depictered to you? Hold up,
Samantha! Be firm, Josiah Allenâ€™s wife! John Rogers! The nine! One at
NA
So at last, by these almost convulsive efforts at calmness, I grew more
calmer and composeder. Josiah had hitched up and gone.
And he come home clever, and all excited with a new thing.
They are buildinâ€™ a new court-house at Jonesville. It is most done,
and it seemed they got into a dispute that day about the cupelow. They
wanted to have the figger of Liberty sculped out on it; and they had got
the man there all ready, and he had begun to sculp her as a woman,--the
goddess of Liberty, he called her. But at the last minute a dispute
had rosen: some of the leadinâ€™ minds of Jonesville, uncle Nate Gowdey
amongst â€˜em, insisted on it that Liberty wuznâ€™t a woman, he wuz a man.
And they wanted him depictered as a man, with whiskers and pantaloons
and a standinâ€™ collar, and boots and spurs--Josiah Allen wus the one
that wanted the spurs.
He said the dispute waxed furious; and he says to â€˜em,--
NA
And so it was agreed on that theyâ€™d leave it to me. And he drove the
old mare home, almost beyond her strength, he wus so anxious to have it
settled.
I wus jest makinâ€™ some cream biscuit for supper as he come in, and asked
me about it; and a minute is a minute in makinâ€™ warm biscuit. You want
to make â€˜em quick, and bake â€˜em quick. My mind wus fairly held onto
that dough--and needed on it; but instinctively I told him he wus in the
right ont. Liberty here in the United States wuz a man, and, in order
to be consistent, ort to be depictered with whiskers and overcoat and a
standinâ€™ collar.
NA
NA
â€œInstead of the spurs on his boots, he might be depictered as settinâ€™
his boot-heel onto the respectful petition of fifty thousand wimmen, who
had ventured to ask him for a little mite of what he wus sâ€™posed to have
quantities of--Freedom.

wavinâ€™ off into prison an intelligent Christian woman, who had spent her
whole noble, useful life in studyinâ€™ the laws of our nation, for darinâ€™
to think she had as much right under our Constitution, as a low, totally

Says I, â€œThat will give Liberty jest as imperious and showy a look as

Wall, he said he would mention it to â€˜em; and says he, with a contented
look,--
NA
Wall, I didnâ€™t say no more: and I got him as good a supper as the house
afforded, and kepâ€™ still as death on politics; fur I could not help
havinâ€™ some hopes that he might get sick of the idee of public life. And
I kepâ€™ him down close all that eveninâ€™ to religion and the weather.
[Illustration: JONESVILLE COURTHOUSE.]
But, alas! my hopes wus doomed to fade away. And, as days passed by, I
see the thought of beinâ€™ a senator wus ever before him. The cares and
burdens of political life seemed to be a loominâ€™ up in front of him,
and in a quiet way he seemed to be fittinâ€™ himself for the duties of his
position.
He come in one day with Solomon Cypherâ€™ses shovel, and I asked him â€œwhat

NA
NA
NA
the other party. I am a Democrat, and this is party spoils. I am goinâ€™
NA
NA
NA
to practise sometime. I must begin to do as they all do. And it is a

Says I, â€œYou are goinâ€™ to carry that shovel right straight home, Josiah
NA
And I made him.
The _idee_.
But I see in this and in many kindred things, that he wuz a dwellinâ€™ on
this thought of political life--its honors and emollients. And often,
and in dark hints, he would speak of his _Plan_. If every other means
failed, if he couldnâ€™t spare the money to buy enough votes, how his
_plan_ wus goinâ€™ to be the makinâ€™ of him.
And I overheard him tellinâ€™ the babe once, as he wus rockinâ€™ her to
sleep in the kitchen, â€œhow her grandpa had got up somethinâ€™ that no
other babeâ€™s grandpa had ever thought of, and how she would probable see
NA
I wus makinâ€™ nut-cakes in the buttery; and I shuddered so at these
words, that I got in most as much agin lemon as I wanted in â€˜em. I wus
a droppinâ€™ it into a spoon, and it run over, I wus that shook at the
thought of his plan.
I had known his plans in the past, and had hefted â€˜em. And I truly
felt that his plans wus liable any time to be the death of him, and the
ruination.
But he wouldnâ€™t tell!
But kepâ€™ his mind immovibly sot, as I could see. And the very day of the
shovel episode, along towards night he rousted out of a brown study,--a
sort of a dark-brown study,--and says he,--
NA
NA
my mind had been so strained and racked that I donâ€™t know as it would
have surprized me if Josiah Allen had riz up, and knocked me down.
NA
I sithed, not a wonderinâ€™ sithe, but a despairinâ€™ one; and he went on,--
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œWhy, uncle Nate Gowdey and I, and a few others who love quiet, and
love to see folks do as they ort to, lay out to take some shot-guns and
_make_ them niggers vote right; make â€˜em vote for me; shoot â€˜em right

NA
of the Government? Do you want to be hung, and see your widow a breakinâ€™
NA
â€œOh! I shouldnâ€™t get hung. The Government wouldnâ€™t do nothinâ€™. The
Government feels jest as I do,--that it would be wrong to stir up old
bitternesses, and race differences. The bloody shirt has been washed,
and ironed out; and it wouldnâ€™t be right to dirty it up agin. The
colored race is now at peace; and if they will only do right, do jest as

I groaned, and couldnâ€™t help it; and he says,--
â€œWhy, hang it all, Samantha, if I make any show at all in public life, I

NA
it, I murmured sternly to myself,--
NA
NA
[Illustration: MAKING THEM DO RIGHT.]
So with sithes that could hardly be sithed, so big and hefty wuz they, I
commenced to make preparations for embarkinâ€™ on my tower. And no martyr
that ever sot down on a hot gridiron wus animated by a more warm and
martyrous feelinâ€™ of self-sacrifice. Yes, I truly felt, that if there
wus dangers to be faced, and daggers run through pardners, I felt I
would ruther they would pierce my own spare-ribs than Josiahâ€™s. (I say
spare-ribs for oritory--my ribs are not spare, fur from it.)
I didnâ€™t really believe, if he run, he would run clear to Washington.
And yet, when my mind roamed on some public men, and how fur they run, I
would groan, and hurry up my preparations.
I knew my tower must be but a short one, for sugarinâ€™-time wus
approachinâ€™ with rapid strides, and Samantha must be at the hellum. But
I also knew, that with a determined mind, and a willinâ€™ heart,
great things could be accomplished speedily; so I commenced makinâ€™
preparations, and layinâ€™ on plans.
As become a woman of my cast-iron principles, I fixed up mostly on
the inside of my head instead of the outside. I studied the map of the
United States. I done several sums on the slate, to harden my mind, and
help me grasp great facts, and meet difficulties bravely. I read Gassâ€™es
NA
bears. Expectinâ€™, as I did, to see trouble, I read over agin that
book that has been my stay in so many hard-fit battle-fields of
NA
I studied G. Washingtonâ€™s picture on the parlor-wall, to get kinder
stirred up in my mind about him, soâ€™s to realize to the full my
privileges as I wept onto his tomb, and stood in the capital he had
foundered.
Thomas J. come one day while I wus musinâ€™ on George; and he says,--
NA
Says I firmly, and keepinâ€™ the same posture, â€œI am studyinâ€™ the face of
the revered and noble G. Washington. I am going shortly to weep on his
tomb and the capital he foundered. I am studyinâ€™ his face, and Gassâ€™es
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
donâ€™t know now what he meant, and donâ€™t much care. Thomas J. is full of
queer remarks, anyway. But deep. He had a sick spell a few weeks ago;
and I went to see him the first thing in the morninâ€™, after I heard of
it. He had overworked, the doctor said, and his heart wuz a little weak.
He looked real white; and I took holt of his hand, and says I,--
NA
NA
NA
NA
And he says, â€œIf I were a morning paper, mother, I shouldnâ€™t be a
NA
A jokinâ€™ right there, when he couldnâ€™t lift his head. But he got over
it: he always did have them sort of sick spells, from a little child.
But a manlier, good-hearteder, level-headeder boy never lived than
Thomas Jefferson Allen. He is _just right_, and always wuz. And though I
wouldnâ€™t have it get out for the world, I canâ€™t help seeinâ€™ it, that he
goes fur ahead of Tirzah Ann in intellect, and nobleness of nater; and
though I love â€˜em both devotedly, I _do_, and I canâ€™t help it, like him
jest a little mite the best. But _this_ I wouldnâ€™t have get out for a
thousand dollars. I tell it in strict confidence, and sâ€™pose it will
be kepâ€™ as such. Mebby I hadnâ€™t ort to tell it at all. Mebby it hainâ€™t
quite orthodox in me to feel so. But it is truthful, anyway. And
sometimes I get to kinder wobblinâ€™ round inside of my mind, and a
wonderinâ€™ which is the best,--to be orthodox, or truthful,--and I sort
oâ€™ settle down to thinkinâ€™ I will tell the truth anyway.
Josiah, I think, likes Tirzah Ann the best.
But I studied deep, and mused. Mused on our 4 fathers, and our 4
mothers, and on Liberty, and Independence, and Truth, and the Eagle. And
thinkinâ€™ I might jest as well be to work while I was a musinâ€™, I had a
dress made for the occasion. It wus bran new, and the color wus Bismark
Brown.
Josiah wanted me to have Ashes of Moses color.
But I said no. With my mind in the heroic state it was then, I couldnâ€™t
curb it down onto Ashes of Moses, or roses, or any thing else peacible.
I felt that this color, remindinâ€™ me of two grand heroes,--Bismark, John
Brown,--suited me to a T. There wus two wimmen who stood ready to make
it,--Jane Bently and Martha Snyder. I chose Martha because Martha wus
the name of the wife of Washington.
It wus made with a bask.
When the news got out that I wus goinâ€™ to Washington on a tower, the
neighbors all wanted to send errents by me.
Betsey Bobbet wanted me to go to the Patent Office, and get her two
Patent-office books, for scrap-books for poetry.
Uncle Jarvis Bently wanted me to go to the Agricultural Bureau, and get
him a paper of lettis seed. And Solomon Cypher wanted me to get him a
new kind of string-beans, if I could, and some cowcumber seeds.
Uncle Nate Gowdey, who talked of paintinâ€™ his house over, wanted me to
ask the President what kind of paint he used on the White House, and if
he put in any sperits of turpentime. And Ardelia Rumsey, who wuz goinâ€™
to be married soon, wanted me, if I see any new kinds of bed-quilt
patterns to the White House, or to the senatorsâ€™ housen, to get the
patterns for her. She said she wus sick of sunflowers, and blazinâ€™
stars, and such. She thought mebby theyâ€™d have suthinâ€™ new, spread-eagle
style, or suthinâ€™ of that kind. She said â€œher feller was goinâ€™ to be
NA
NA
NA
I told her â€œif she wanted a Government quilt, and wanted it appropriate,
NA
And she said she had jest finished a crazy-quilt, with seven thousand
pieces of silk in it, and each piece trimmed with seven hundred stitches
of feather stitchinâ€™: she counted â€˜em. And then I remembered seeinâ€™ it.
There wus some talk then about wimmenâ€™s rights, and a petition wus got
up in Jonesville for wimmen to sign; and I remember well that Ardelia
couldnâ€™t sign it for lack of time. She wanted to, but she hadnâ€™t got the
quilt moreâ€™n half done then. It took the biggest heft of two years to
do it. And so, of course, less important things had to be put aside till
she got it finished.
And I remember, too, that Ardeliaâ€™s mother wanted to sign it; but she
couldnâ€™t, owinâ€™ to a bed-spread she wus a makinâ€™. She wuz a quiltinâ€™ in
Noahâ€™s ark, and all the animals, at that time, on a Turkey-red quilt.
I remember she wuz a quiltinâ€™ the camel that day, and couldnâ€™t be
disturbed. So we didnâ€™t get the names. It took the old lady three years
to quilt that quilt. And when it wuz done, it wuz a sight to behold.
Though, as I said then, and say now, I wouldnâ€™t give much to sleep
under so many animals. But folks went from fur and near to see it, and
I enjoyed lookinâ€™ at it that day. And I see jest how it wuz. I see that
she couldnâ€™t sign. It wuznâ€™t to be expected that a woman could stop to
tend to Justice or Freedom, or any thing else of that kind, right in the
midst of a camel.
Zebulin Coon wanted me to carry a new hen-coop of hisen to get it
patented. And I thought to myself, I wonder if theyâ€™ll ask me to carry a
cow.
And sure enough, Josiah wanted me to dicker, if I could, for a calf
from Mount Vernon,--swop one of our yearlinâ€™s for it if I couldnâ€™t do no
better.
But I told him right out and out, that I couldnâ€™t go into a calf-trade
with my mind wrought up as I knew it would be.
Wall, it wuznâ€™t moreâ€™n 2 or 3 days after I begun my preparations, that
Dorlesky Burpy, a vegetable widow, come to see me; and the errents
she sent by me wuz fur more hefty and momentous than all the rest put
together, calves, hen-coop, and all.
[Illustration: THE MOTHERâ€™S BED-QUILT.]
And when she told â€˜em over to me, and I meditated on her reasons for
sendinâ€™ â€˜em, and her need of havinâ€™ â€˜em done, I felt that I would do
the errents for her if a breath was left in my body. I felt that I
would bear them 2 errents of hern on my tower side by side with my own
private, hefty mission for Josiah.
She come for a all dayâ€™s visit; and though she is a vegetable widow, and
very humbly, I wuz middlinâ€™ glad to see her. But thinksâ€™es I to myself
as I carried away her things into the bedroom, â€œSheâ€™ll want to send some
NA
And so it didnâ€™t surprise me any when she asked me the first thing when
NA
And I looked agreeable to the idee; for I sâ€™posed it wuz some new kind
of tattinâ€™, mebby, or fancy work. And I told her â€œI shouldnâ€™t have much
NA
NA
And then I thought mebby it wus some new kind of waltz; and I told her
NA
NA
And I hung back, and asked her in a cautius tone â€œhow many she wanted
NA
I knew I had a good many things to buy for my tower; and, though I
wanted to obleege Dorlesky, I didnâ€™t feel like runninâ€™ into any great
expense for canvass.
And then she broke off from that subject, and said â€œshe wanted her
NA
And then she says, going back to the old subject agin, â€œI hear that
NA
NA
believe in beinâ€™ straightforward, and not holdinâ€™ out no false hopes,--I
said â€œshe must furnish her own canvass, for I hadnâ€™t a mite in the
NA
But Josiah didnâ€™t get home till after her folks come after her. So he
wuznâ€™t canvassed.
But she talked a sight about her children, and how bad she felt to be
parted from â€˜em, and how much she used to think of her husband, and how
her hull life wus ruined, and how the Whiskey Ring had done it,--that,
and wimmenâ€™s helpless condition under the law. And she cried, and wept,
and cried about her children, and her sufferinâ€™s she had suffered; and
I did. I cried onto my apron, and couldnâ€™t help it. A new apron too. And
right while I wus cryinâ€™ onto that gingham apron, she made me promise to
carry them two errents of hern to the President, and to get â€˜em done for
her if I possibly could.
â€œShe wanted the Whiskey Ring destroyed, and she wanted her rights; and
NA
I wiped my eyes off, and told her I didnâ€™t believe she could get â€˜em
done in that length of time, but I would tell the President about it,
and â€œI thought moreâ€™n as likely as not he would want to do right by
NA
NA
And then, to kinder get her mind off of her sufferinâ€™s, I asked her
how her sister Susan wus a gettinâ€™ along. I hadnâ€™t heard from her for
years--she married Philemon Clapsaddle; and Dorlesky spoke out as bitter
as a bitter walnut--a green one. And says she,--
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
their property is gone. It has gone down Philemon Clapsaddleâ€™s throat.
Look down that manâ€™s throat, and you will see 150 acres of land, a good
NA
NA
NA
in still more bitter axents, â€œYou will see four mules, and a span of
horses, two buggies, a double sleigh, and three buffalo-robes. He
has drinked â€˜em all up--and 2 horse-rakes, a cultivator, and a
thrashinâ€™-machine.
NA
â€œThe boys have inherited their fatherâ€™s evil habits, and drink as bad as
NA
NA
And then, thinkinâ€™ I must say sunthinâ€™, and wantinâ€™ to strike a safe
subject, and a good-lookinâ€™ one, I says,--
â€œWhere is your aunt Euniceâ€™es girl? that pretty girl I see to your house
NA
NA
NA
â€œYes, I be, the livinâ€™ truth. She went to New York to buy millinary
goods for her motherâ€™s store. It wus quite cool when she left home, and
she hadnâ€™t took off her winter clothes: and it come on brilinâ€™ hot in
the city; and in goinâ€™ about from store to store, the heat and the hard
work overcome her, and she fell down in the street in a sort of a
faintinâ€™-fit, and was called drunk, and dragged off to a police court by
a man who wus a animal in human shape. And he misused her in such a way,
that she never got over the horror of what befell her--when she come to,
to find herself at the mercy of a brute in a manâ€™s shape. She went into
a melancholy madness, and wus sent to the asylum. Of course they
NA
bitterly.
I sithed a long and mournful sithe, and sot silent agin for quite a
spell. But thinkinâ€™ I _must_ be sociable, I says,--
NA
NA
NA
NA
gall.
â€œYou know, she owns a big property in tenement-houses, and other
buildings, where she lives. Of course her taxes wus awful high; and she
didnâ€™t expect to have any voice in tellinâ€™ how that money, a part of her
own property, that she earned herself in a store, should be used.
[Illustration: MAN LIFTING UP EUNICE.]
â€œBut she had jest been taxed high for new sidewalks in front of some of
her buildinâ€™s.
â€œAnd then another man come into power in that ward, and he natrully
wanted to make some money out of her; and he had a spite aginst her,
too, so he ordered her to build new sidewalks. And she wouldnâ€™t tear up
a good sidewalk to please him or anybody else, so she was put to jail
NA
Thinksâ€™es I to myself, I donâ€™t believe the law would have been so hard
on her if she hadnâ€™t been so humbly. The Burpys are a humbly lot. But I
didnâ€™t think it out loud. And I didnâ€™t uphold the law for feelinâ€™ so, if
it did. No: I says in pityinâ€™ tones,--for I wus truly sorry for Eunice
Keeler,--
NA
NA
has got her grit up, and wonâ€™t pay: and no knowinâ€™ how it will end. She
NA
NA
of talkinâ€™,--very flowery.
[Illustration: EUNICE IN JAIL.]
NA
I truly felt that I dassent speak to her about any human beinâ€™ under the
sun, not knowinâ€™ what turn she would give to the conversation, beinâ€™ so
embittered. But I felt the weather wus safe, and cotton stockinâ€™s, and
factory-cloth; and I kepâ€™ her down onto them subjects for moreâ€™n two
hours.
But, good land! I canâ€™t blame her for beinâ€™ embittered aginst men and
the laws they have made; for, if ever a woman has been tormented, she
has.
It honestly seems to me as if I never see a human creeter so afflicted
as Dorlesky Burpy has been, all her life.
Why, her sufferinâ€™s date back before she wus born; and that is goinâ€™
pretty fur back. You see, her father and mother had had some difficulty:
and he wus took down with billious colic voyolent four weeks before
Dorlesky wus born; and some think it wus the hardness between â€˜em, and
some think it wus the gripinâ€™ of the colic at the time he made his will;
anyway, he willed Dorlesky away, boy or girl, whichever it wuz, to his
brother up on the Canada line.
So, when Dorlesky wus born (and born a girl, entirely onbeknown to her),
she wus took right away from her mother, and gin to this brother. Her
mother couldnâ€™t help herself: he had the law on his side. But it jest
killed her. She drooped right away and died, before the baby wus a year
old. She was a affectionate, tenderhearted woman; and her husband wus
kinder overbearinâ€™, and stern always.
But it wus this last move of hisen that killed her; for I tell you, it
is pretty tough on a mother to have her baby, a part of her own life,
took right out of her arms, and gin to a stranger.
For this uncle of hern wus a entire stranger to Dorlesky when the will
wus made. And almost like a stranger to her father, for he hadnâ€™t seen
him sence he wus a boy; but he knew he hadnâ€™t any children, and sâ€™posed
he wus rich and respectable. But the truth wuz, he had been a runninâ€™
down every way,--had lost his property and his character, wus dissipated
and mean (onbeknown, it wus sâ€™posed, to Dorleskyâ€™s father). But the will
was made, and the law stood. Men are ashamed now, to think the law wus
ever in voge; but it wuz, and is now in some of the States. The law wus
in voge, and the poor young mother couldnâ€™t help herself. It has always
been the boast of our American law, that it takes care of wimmen. It
took care of her. It held her in its strong, protectinâ€™ grasp, and held
her so tight, that the only way she could slip out of it wus to drop
into the grave, which she did in a few months. Then it leggo.
But it kepâ€™ holt of Dorlesky: it bound her tight to her uncle, while he
run through with what little property she had; while he sunk lower and
lower, until at last he needed the very necessaries of life; and then
he bound her out to work, to a woman who kepâ€™ a drinkinâ€™-den, and the
lowest, most degraded hant of vice.
Twice Dorlesky run away, beinâ€™ virtuous but humbly; but them strong,
protectinâ€™ arms of the law that had held her mother so tight, jest
reached out, and dragged her back agin. Upheld by them, her uncle could
compel her to give her service wherever he wanted her to work; and he
wus owinâ€™ this woman, and she wanted Dorleskyâ€™s work, so she had to
submit.
But the 3d time, she made a effort so voyalent that she got away. A good
woman, who, beinâ€™ nothinâ€™ but a woman, couldnâ€™t do any thing towards
onclinchinâ€™ them powerful arms that wuz protectinâ€™ her, helped her to
slip through â€˜em. And Dorlesky come to Jonesville to live with a sister
of that good woman; changed her name, soâ€™s it wouldnâ€™t be so easy to
find her; grew up to be a nice, industrious girl. And when the woman she
was took by, died, she left Dorlesky quite a handsome property.
And finally she married Lank Rumsey, and did considerable well, it
was sâ€™posed. Her property, put with what little he had, made â€˜em a
comfortable home; and they had two pretty little children,--a boy and
a girl. But when the little girl was a baby, he took to drinkinâ€™,
neglected his business, got mixed up with a whisky-ring, whipped
Dorlesky--not so very hard. He went accordinâ€™ to law; and the law of
the United States donâ€™t approve of a man whippinâ€™ his wife enough to
endanger her life--it says it donâ€™t. He made every move of hisen lawful,
and felt that Dorlesky hadnâ€™t ort to complain and feel hurt. But a good
whippinâ€™ will make anybody feel hurt, law or no law. And then he parted
with her, and got her property and her two little children. Why, it
seemed as if every thing under the sun and moon, that _could_ happen to
a woman, had happened to Dorlesky, painful things, and gaulinâ€™.
Jest before Lank parted with her, she fell on a broken sidewalk: some
think he tripped her up, but it never was proved. But, anyway, Dorlesky
fell, and broke her hip bone; and her husband sued the corporation, and
got ten thousand dollars for it. Of course, the law give the money to
him, and she never got a cent of it. But she wouldnâ€™t never have made
any fuss over that, knowinâ€™ that the law of the United States was such.
But what made it gaulinâ€™ to her wuz, that, while she was layinâ€™ there
achinâ€™ in splints, he took that very money and used it to court up
another woman with. Gin her presents, jewellry, bunnets, head-dresses,
artificial flowers, and etcetery, out of Dorleskyâ€™s own hip-money.
[Illustration: DORLESKYâ€™S TRIALS.]
And I donâ€™t know as any thing could be much more gaulinâ€™ to a woman than
that wuz,--while she lay there, groaninâ€™ in splints, to have her husband
take the money for her own broken bones, and dress up another woman like
a doll with it.
But the law gin it to him; and he was only availinâ€™ himself of the
glorious liberty of our free republic, and doinâ€™ as he was a mind to.
And it was sâ€™posed that that very hip-money was what made the match.
For, before she wus fairly out of splints, he got a divorce from her.
And by the help of that money, and the Whisky Ring, he got her two
little children away from her.
And I wonder if there is a mother in the land, that can blame Dorlesky
for gettinâ€™ mad, and wantinâ€™ her rights, and wantinâ€™ the Whisky Ring
broke up, when they think it over,--how she has been fooled round with
by men, willed away, and whipped and parted with and stole from. Why,
they canâ€™t blame her for feelinâ€™ fairly savage about â€˜em--and she duz.
For as she says to me once when we wus a talkinâ€™ it over, how every
thing had happened to her that could happen to a woman, and how curious
it wuz,--
NA
NA
And, sure enough, I couldnâ€™t dispute her. Trouble and wrongs and
sufferinâ€™s seemed to be epidemic in the race of Burpy wimmen. Why, one
of her aunts on her fatherâ€™s side, Patty Burpy, married for her first
husband Eliphalet Perkins. He was a minister, rode on a circuit. And he
took Patty on it too; and she rode round with him on it, a good deal of
the time. But she never loved to: she wus a woman who loved to be still,
and be kinder settled down at home.
But she loved Eliphalet so well, she would do any thing to please him:
so she rode round with him on that circuit, till she was perfectly
fagged out.
He was a dretful good man to her; but he wus kinder poor, and they had
hard times to get along. But what property they had wuznâ€™t taxed, so
that helped some; and Patty would make one doller go a good ways.
No, their property wasnâ€™t taxed till Eliphalet died. Then the supervisor
taxed it the very minute the breath left his body; run his horse, so it
was said, soâ€™s to be sure to get it onto the tax-list, and comply with
the law.
You see, Eliphaletâ€™s salary stopped when his breath did. And I sâ€™pose
mebby the law thought, seemâ€™ she was a havinâ€™ trouble, she might jest as
well have a little more; so it taxed all the property it never had taxed
a cent for before.
But she had this to console her anyway,--that the law didnâ€™t forget her
in her widowhood. No: the law is quite thoughtful of wimmen, by spells.
It says, the law duz, that it protects wimmen. And I sâ€™pose in some
mysterious way, too deep for wimmen to understand, it was protectinâ€™ her
now.
Wall, she suffered along, and finally married agin. I wondered why she
did. But she was such a quiet, home-lovinâ€™ woman, that it was sâ€™posed
she wanted to settle down, and be kinder still and sot. But of all the
bad luck she had! She married on short acquaintance, and he proved to be
a perfect wanderer. Why, he couldnâ€™t keep still. It was sâ€™posed to be a
mark.
He moved Patty thirteen times in two years; and at last he took her into
a cart,--a sort of a covered wagon,--and travelled right through the
Eastern States with her. He wanted to see the country, and loved to
live in the wagon: it was his make. And, of course, the law give him the
control of her body; and she had to go where he moved it, or else part
with him. And I sâ€™pose the law thought it was guardinâ€™ and nourishinâ€™
her when it was a joltinâ€™ her over them praries and mountains and
abysses. But it jest kepâ€™ her shook up the hull of the time.
It wus the regular Burpy luck.
[Illustration: PATTY AND HUSBAND TRAVELLING IN THE FAR WEST.]
And then, another one of her aunts, Drusilla Burpy, she married a
industrius, hard-workinâ€™ man,--one that never drinked a drop, and was
sound on the doctrines, and give good measure to his customers: he was
a grocer-man. And a master hand for wantinâ€™ to foller the laws of his
country, as tight as laws could be follered. And so, knowinâ€™ that the
NA
NA
master hand for wantinâ€™ to do every thing faithful, and do his very best
for his customers, it was sâ€™posed that he wanted to do his best for the
law; and so, when he got to whippinâ€™ Drusilla, he would whip her _too_
severe--he would be _too_ faithful to it.
You see, the way ont was, what made him whip her at all wuz, she was
cross to him. They had nine little children. She always thought that two
or three children would be about all one woman could bring up well â€œby
NA
more ensuinâ€™ly. But he felt that big families wuz a protection to the
NA
foller their fatherâ€™s footsteps, and be noble, law-making, law-abiding
citizens, jest as he was.
But she had to do every mite of the housework, and milk cows, and make
butter and cheese, and cook and wash and scour, and take all the care
of the children, day and night, in sickness and in health, and spin and
weave the cloth for their clothes (as wimmen did in them days), and then
make â€˜em, and keep â€˜em clean. And when there wuz so many of â€˜em, and
only about a yearâ€™s difference in their ages, some of â€˜em--why, I sâ€™pose
she sometimes thought more of her own achinâ€™ back than she did of the
good of the Government; and she would get kinder discouraged sometimes,
and be cross to him.
And knowinâ€™ his own motives was so high and loyal, he felt that he ought
to whip her. So he did.
And what shows that Drusilla wuznâ€™t so bad as he sâ€™posed she wuz, what
shows that she did have her good streaks, and a deep reverence for the
law, is, that she stood his whippinâ€™s first-rate, and never whipped him.
Now, she wuz fur bigger than he wuz, weighed 80 pounds the most, and
might have whipped him if the law had been such.
[Illustration: BEATING HIS WIFE.]
But they was both law-abidinâ€™, and wanted to keep every preamble; so she
stood it to be whipped, and never once whipped him in all the seventeen
years they lived together.
She died when her twelfth child was born: there wus jest 13 months
difference in the age of that and the one next older. And they said she
often spoke out in her last sickness, and said,--
NA
And they said the same thought wus a great comfort to him in his last
moments.
He died about a year after she did, leaving his 2nd wife with twins and
a good property.
Then, there was Abagail Burpy. She married a sort of a high-headed
man, though one that paid his debts, and was truthful, and considerable
good-lookinâ€™, and played well on the fiddle. Why, it seemed as if he had
almost every qualification for makinâ€™ a woman happy, only he had jest
this one little excentricity,--that man would lock up Abagail Burpyâ€™s
clothes every time he got mad at her.
Of course the law give her clothes to him; and knowinâ€™ it was one of the
laws of the United States, she wouldnâ€™t have complained only when she
had company. But it was mortifyinâ€™, and nobody could dispute it, to have
company come, and nothinâ€™ to put on.
Several times she had to withdraw into the wood-house, and stay most
of the day, shiverinâ€™, and under the cellar-stairs, and round in
clothes-presses.
But he boasted in prayer-meetinâ€™s, and on boxes before grocery-stores,
that he wus a law-abidinâ€™ citizen; and he wuz. Eben Flanders wouldnâ€™t
lie for anybody.
But Iâ€™ll bet that Abagail Flanders beat our old Revolutionary 4 mothers
in thinkinâ€™ out new laws, when she lay round under stairs, and behind
barrells, in her nightdress.
You see, when a man hides his wiveâ€™s corset and petticoat, it is
NA
believe it, you ort to have peeked round them barrells, and seen
Abagailâ€™s eyes. Why, they had hull reams of by-laws in â€˜em, and
NA
Why, it beat every thing I ever heard on, the lawful sufferinâ€™s of them
wimmen. For there wuznâ€™t nothinâ€™ illegal about one single trouble of
theirn. They suffered accordinâ€™ to law, every one of â€˜em. But it wus
tuff for â€˜em--very tuff.
And their all beinâ€™ so dretful humbly wuz and is another drawback to
â€˜em; though that, too, is perfectly lawful, as everybody knows.
And Dorlesky looks as bad agin as she would otherways, on account of her
teeth.
It wus after Lank had begun to kinder get after this other woman, and
wus indifferent to his wiveâ€™s looks, that Dorlesky had a new set of
teeth on her upper jaw. And they sort oâ€™ sot out, and made her look so
bad that it fairly made her ache to look at herself in the glass. And
they hurt her gooms too. And she carried â€˜em back to the dentist, and
wanted him to make her another set.
But the dentist acted mean, and wouldnâ€™t take â€˜em back, and sued Lank
for the pay. And they had a lawsuit. And the law beinâ€™ such that a
woman canâ€™t testify in court in any matter that is of mutual interest
to husband and wife--and Lank wantinâ€™ to act mean, too, testified that
NA
And there Dorlesky sot right in front of â€˜em with her gooms achinâ€™, and
her face all pokinâ€™ out, and lookinâ€™ like furyation, and couldnâ€™t say a
word. But she had to give in to the law.
And ruther than go toothless, she wears â€˜em to this day. And I do
believe it is the raspinâ€™ of them teeth aginst her gooms, and her
discouraged and mad feelinâ€™s every time she looks in a glass, that helps
to embitter her towards men, and the laws men have made, soâ€™s a woman
canâ€™t have the control over her own teeth and her own bones.
Wall, Dorlesky went home about 4 P.M., I a promisinâ€™ at the last minute
as sacred as I could, without usinâ€™ a book, to do her errents for her.
I urged her to stay to supper, but she couldnâ€™t; for she said the man
where she worked was usinâ€™ his horses, and couldnâ€™t come after her agin.
And she said that--
â€œMercy on her! how could anybody eat any more supper after such a dinner
NA
And it wuznâ€™t nothinâ€™ extra, I didnâ€™t think. No better than my common
run of dinners.
Wall, she hadnâ€™t been gone over an hour (she a hollerinâ€™ from the wagon,
a charginâ€™ on me solemn, about the errents,--the man she works for is
deef, deef as a post,--and I a noddinâ€™ to her firm, honorable nods, that
I would do â€˜em), and I wus a slickinâ€™ up the settinâ€™-room, and Martha,
who had jest come in, wus measurinâ€™ off my skirt-breadths, when Josiah
Allen drove up, and Cicely and the boy with him.
And there I had been a layinâ€™ out to write to her that very night to
tell her I wus goinâ€™ away, and to be sure and come jest as quick as I
got back!
Wall, I never see the time I wuznâ€™t glad to see Cicely, and I felt that
she could visit to Tirzah Annâ€™s and Thomas J.â€™s while I wus gone. She
looked dretful pale and sad, I thought; but she seemed glad to see
me, and glad to get back. And the boy asked Josiah and Ury and me 47
questions between the wagon and the front doorstep, for I counted â€˜em.
He wus well.
I broached the subject of my tower to Cicely when she and I wus all
alone in her room. And, if youâ€™ll believe it, she all rousted up with
the idee of wantinâ€™ to go too.
She says, â€œYou know, aunt Samantha, just how I have prayed and labored
for my boyâ€™s future; how I have made all the efforts that it is possible
for a woman to make; how I have thrown my heart and life into the
NA
of her pocket, and throwinâ€™ it into my lap,--â€œthat letter tells me just
what I knew so well before,--just how weak a woman is; that they have no

It wus from that old executor, refusinâ€™ to comply with some request she
had made about her own property,--a request of right and truth.
Oh, how glad I would have been to had him execkuted that very minute!
Why, Iâ€™d done it myself if wimmen could execkit--but they canâ€™t.
Says she, â€œIâ€™ll go with you to Washington,--I and the boy. Perhaps I can
NA
in my own mind, and kepâ€™ a demurrinâ€™. Thinksâ€™es I, how can I stand it,
as tired as I expect to be, to have him a askinâ€™ questions all the hull
time? She see I was a demurrinâ€™; and her pretty face grew sadder than it
had, and overcasteder.
And as I see that, I gin in at once, and says with a cheerful face, but
a forebodinâ€™ mind,--
NA
Wall, after supper Cicely and I sot down under the front stoop,--it
was a warm eveninâ€™,--and we talked some about other wimmen. Not runninâ€™
talk, or gossipinâ€™ talk, but jest plain talk, about her aunt Mary, and
her aunt Melissa, and her aunt Maryâ€™s daughter, who wus a runninâ€™ down,
runninâ€™ faster than ever, so I judged from what she said. And how Susan
Ann Grimshaw that was, had a young babe. She said her aunt Mary was
better now, so she had started for the Michigan; but she had had a
dretful sick spell while she was there.
While she wuz a tellinâ€™ me this, Cicely sot on one of the steps of the
stoop: I sot up under it in my rockinâ€™-chair. And she looked dretful
good to me. She had on a white dress. She most always wears white in the
house, when we hainâ€™t got company; and always wears black when she is
dressed up, and when she goes out.
This dress was made of white mull. The yoke wus made all of thin
embroidery, and her white neck and shoulders shone through it like snow.
Her sleeves was all trimmed with lace, and fell back from her pretty
white arms. Her hands wus clasped over her knees; and her hair, which
the boy had got loose a playinâ€™ with her, wus fallinâ€™ round her face
and neck. And her great, earnest eyes wus lookinâ€™ into the West, and the
light from the sunset fallinâ€™ through the morninâ€™-glorys wus a fallinâ€™
over her, till I declare, I never see any thing look so pretty in my
hull life. And there was some thinâ€™ more, fur more than prettiness in
her face, in her big eyes.
It wuznâ€™t unhappiness, and it wuznâ€™t happiness, and I donâ€™t know as I
can tell what it wuz. It seemed as if she wuz a lookinâ€™ fur, fur
away, further than Jonesville, further than the lake that lay beyend
Jonesville, and which was pure gold now,--a sea of glass mingled with
fire,--further than the cloudy masses in the western heavens, which
looked like a city of shininâ€™ mansions, fur off; but her eyes was
lookinâ€™ away off, beyend them.
And I kepâ€™ still, and didnâ€™t feel like talkinâ€™ about other wimmen.
Finally she spoke out. â€œAunt Samantha, what do you suppose I thought
NA
NA
â€œWell, I thought, that, though I loved her so dearly, I almost wished

NA
NA
[Illustration: LOOKING BEYEND THE SUNSET.]
â€œWell, you know how mother and aunt Mary loved each other, how near they
were to each other. Why, mother could always tell when aunt Mary was
ill or in trouble, and she was just the same in regard to mother. And I
canâ€™t think that when death has freed the soul from the flesh, that they
will have less spiritual knowledge of each other than when they were
here; and I felt, that with such a love as theirs, death would only make
their souls nearer: and you know what the Bible says,--that â€˜God shall
make of his angels ministering spirits;â€™ and I _know_ He would send
no other angel but my mother, to dear aunt Maryâ€™s bedside, to take her
spirit home. And I thought, that, if I were there, my mother would be
there right in the room with me; and I didnâ€™t know but I might _feel_
her presence if I could not see her. And I _do_ want my mother so

Says I to myself, â€œFor the landâ€™s sake, what wonâ€™t Cicely think on

to hurt that childâ€™s feelinâ€™s--not for a silver dollar, I wouldnâ€™t.
I only says, in calm accents,--
NA
She looked far off into the shininâ€™ western heavens with that deep,
searchinâ€™, but soft gaze,--seeminâ€™ to look clear through them cloudy
mansions of rose and pearl,--and says she,--
NA
And I says, â€œCicely, you are goinâ€™ to take cold, with nothinâ€™ round your

NA
And the boy overheard me, and asked me 75 questions about ketchinâ€™ the
weather.
â€œIf the weather set a trap? If it ketched with bait, or with a hook, and
NA
Oh my stars! what a time I did have!
The next morninâ€™ after this Cicely wuznâ€™t well enough to get up. I
carried up her breakfast with my own hands,--a good one, though I am fur
from beinâ€™ the one that ort to say it.
And after breakfast, along in the forenoon, Martha, who was makinâ€™
my dress, felt troubled in mind as to whether she had better cut the
polenay kitrinâ€™ ways of the cloth, or not: and Miss Gowdey had jest had
one made in the height of the fashion, to Jonesville; and so to ease
Marthaâ€™s mind (she is one that gets deprested easy, when weighty
subjects are pressinâ€™ her down), I said I would run over cross-lots, and
carry home a drawinâ€™ of tea I had borrowed, and look at the polenay, and
bring back tidinâ€™s from it. And I wus goinâ€™ there acrost the orchard,
when I see the boy a layinâ€™ on his back under a apple-tree, lookinâ€™ up
into the sky; and says I,--
NA
He never got up, nor moved a mite. That is one of the peculiarities of
the boy, you canâ€™t surprise him: nothinâ€™ seems to startle him.
He lay still, and spoke out for all the world as if I had been there
with him all day.
â€œI am lookinâ€™ to see if I can see it. I thought I got a glimpse of it a
NA
NA
â€œThe gate of that City that comes down out of the heavens. You know,
uncle Josiah read about it this morning, out of that big book he prays
out of after breakfast. He said the gate was one pearl.
â€œAnd I asked mamma what a pearl was, and she said it was just like that
ring she wears that papa gave her. And I asked her where the City was,
and she said it was up in the heavens. And I asked her if I should ever
see it; and she said, if I was good, it would swing down out of the sky,
sometime, and that shining gate would open, and I should walk through it
into the City.
[Illustration: LOOKING FOR THE CITY.]
â€œAnd I went right to being good, that minute; and I have been good for
as many as three hours, I should think. And _say_, how long have you got
to be good before you can go through? And _say_, can you see it before

But I had got most out of hearinâ€™ then.
NA
NA
He acted kinder disappointed at dinner-time, and said â€œhe wus tired of
NA
all that afternoon. But he got clever agin before bedtime. And he come
and leaned up aginst my lap at sundown, and asked me, I guess, about 200
questions about the City.
And his eyes looked big and dreamy and soft, and his cheeks looked rosy,
and his mouth awful good and sweet. And his curls wus kinder moist, and
hung down over his white forehead. I _did_ love him, and couldnâ€™t help
it, chin or no chin.
He had been still for quite a spell, a thinkinâ€™; and at last he broke
out,--
NA
And I didnâ€™t know what to tell him; for you know what it says,--
NA
[Illustration: ASKING ABOUT THE CITY.]
But then, agin, I thought, what will become of the respectable church
members who sell the fire that flames up in a manâ€™s soul, and ruins his
life? What will become of them who lend their votes and their influence
to make it right? They vote on Saturdays, to make the sale of this
poison legal, and on Sundays go to church with their respectable
families. And they expect to go right to heaven, of course; for they
have improved all the means of grace. Hired costly pews, and give big
charities--in money obtained by sellinâ€™ robberies, murders, broken
hearts, ruined lives.
But the boy wanted an answer; and his eyes looked questioning but soft.
â€œSay, auntie, do you think weâ€™ll find him there, mamma and I? You know,
that is what mamma cries so for,--she wants him so bad. And do you think

But agin I thought of what it said,--

And agin I didnâ€™t know what to say, and I hurried him off to bed.
But, after he had gone, I spoke out entirely unbeknown to myself, and
says,--

Says I calmly, â€œDo you sâ€™pose, at this late hour, I am goinâ€™ to stop

liquor is good for medicine: if I should say I didnâ€™t, I should be a
lyinâ€™, which I am fur from wantinâ€™ to do at my age. I think it kepâ€™
mother Allen alive for years, jest as I believe arsenic broke up Bildad
Smithâ€™s chills. And I sâ€™pose folks have jest as good a right to use it
for the benefit of their health, as to use any other pizen, or fire, or
any thing.
â€œAnd it should be used jest like pizen and fire and etcetery. You donâ€™t

Cicely wus some better the next day. And two days before we sot sail for

who was goinâ€™ to keep my house durinâ€™ my absence on my tower, come with

But Miss Gowdey took Philury jest enough not to pay her any regular
wages, and didnâ€™t take her enough so Philury could collect any pay from
her when she left. She left, because there wus a hardness between â€˜em,
on account of a grindstun. Philury said Miss Gowdeyâ€™s little boy broke
the grindstun, and the boy laid it to Philury. Anyway, the grindstun wus
broke, and it made a hardness. And when Philury left Miss Gowdeyâ€™s, all
her worldly wealth wuz held in that poor, pitiful lookinâ€™ trunk. Why,
the trunk looked like Philury, and Philury looked like the trunk. It
looked small, and meek, and well disposed; and the brass nails looked
some like frecks, only larger.
Wall, I felt sorry for her: and I sâ€™posed, that, married or single, she
would have to wear stockinâ€™s; so I told her, that, besides her wages,
she might have all the lambâ€™s-wool yarn she wanted to spin while I was
gone, after doinâ€™ the house-work.
She wus tickled enough as I told her.

Miss Gowdey wouldnâ€™t do much for you on account of that hardness about
the grindstun; and knowinâ€™ that you hainâ€™t got no mother, I have laid

And she blushed, and said â€œshe expected to marry Ury sometime--years and

NA
Philury is a real handy little thing about the house. And so willinâ€™ and
clever, that I guess, if I had asked her to jump into the oven, and bake
herself, she would have done it. And so I told Josiah.
[Illustration: PHILURY.]

NA
And says I, â€œSoft or not, sheâ€™s good. And that is more than I can say
NA
I will stand up for my sect.
Wall, in three daysâ€™ time we sot sail for Washington, D.C., I a feelinâ€™
well about Josiah. For Philury and Ury wus clever, and would do well by
him. And the cubbard wus full and overflowinâ€™ with every thing good to
eat. And I felt that I had indeed, in that cubbard, left him a consoler.
Josiah took us to the train about an hour and a half too early. But
I wus glad we wus on time, because it would have worked Josiah up
dretfully if we hadnâ€™t been. For he had spent the most of the latter
part of the night in gettinâ€™ up and walkinâ€™ out to the clock to see if
it wus approachinâ€™ train time: the train left at a quarter to ten.
I wus glad on his account, and also on my own; for at the last minute,
as you may say, who should come a runninâ€™ down to the depot but Sam
Shelmadine, a wantinâ€™ to send a errent by me to Washington.
He kinder wunk me out to one side of the waitinâ€™-room, and asked me â€œif
NA
It kinder runs in the blood of the Shelmadines to love to steal, and he
owned up that it did. But he wuznâ€™t goinâ€™ into it for that, he said: he
wanted the profit of it.
NA
such a witherinâ€™ way, that I should most probable have withered him,
only he is blind with one eye, and I was on the blind side.
But he argued with me, and said it was no worse than to give licenses
for other kinds of meanness.
He said they give licenses now to steal--steal folksâ€™es senses away, and
then they would steal every thing else, and murder, and tear round into
every kind of wickedness. But he didnâ€™t ask that. He wanted things done
fair and square: he jest wanted to steal horses. He was goinâ€™ West, and
he thought he could do a good business, and lay up something. If he had
a license, he shouldnâ€™t be afraid of beinâ€™ shot up, or shot.
But I refused the job with scorn; and jest as I wus refusinâ€™, the cars
snorted, and I wus glad they did. They seemed to express in that wild
snort something of the indignation I felt.
The _idee_.
When Cicely and the boy and I got to Washington, the shades of twilight
was a shadin the earth gently; and we got a man to take us to Condelick
Smithâ€™ses.
The man was in a hack, as Cicely called it (and he had a hackinâ€™ cough,
too, which made it seem more singular). We told him to take us right to
Miss Condelick Smithâ€™ses. Condelick is my own cousin on my own side, and
travelinâ€™ on the road for groceries.
She keeps a nice, quiet boardinâ€™-house. Only a few boarders, â€œwith the
NA
heard I wus a cominâ€™ to Washington. She said we had _got_ to go to
her house; so we went, with the distinct knowledge in our minds and
pocket-books, of payinâ€™ for our 3 boards.
She was very tickled to see us, and embraced us almost warmly. She had
been over a hot fire a cookinâ€™. She is humbly, but likely, I have been
told and believe.
She has got a wen on her cheek, but that donâ€™t hurt her any. Wens hainâ€™t
nothinâ€™ that detract from a personâ€™s moral worth.
There is only one child in the family,--Condelick, Jr., aged 13. A
good, fat boy, with white hair and blue eyes, and a great capacity for
blushinâ€™, but seemed to be good dispositioned.
It wus late supper time; and we had only time to go up into our rooms,
and bathe our weary faces and hands, when we had to go down to supper.
Miss Condelick Smith called it dinner: she misspoke herself. Havinâ€™ so
much on her hands, it is no wonder that she should make a slip once in a
while. I should, myself, if my mind wuznâ€™t like iron for strength. There
wus only three or four to the table besides us: it wuz later than their
usial supper time. There wus a young couple there who had jest been
married, and come there to live.
Ever sense we left home we had seen sights and sights of brides and
groomses. It seemed to be a good time of year for â€˜em; and Cicely and I
would pass the time by guessinâ€™, from their demeaners, how long they had
been married. You know they act very soft the first day or two, and then
harden gradually, as time passes, till sometimes they get very hard.
Wall, as I looked at this young pair, I whispered to Cicely,--
NA
They acted well. Though I see with pain that the bride was tryinâ€™ to
foller after the groom blindly, and I see she was a layinâ€™ up trouble
for herself. Amongst other good things, they had a baked chicken for
supper; and when the young husband wus asked what part of the fowl he
would take, he said,--
NA
And then, when they asked the bride, she blushed sweetly, and said,--
NA
And she beinâ€™ next to me, I said to her in a low tone, but firm and
motherly,--
â€œYou are a beginner in married life; and I say to you, as one who has
had stiddy practice for 20 years, begin right. Let your affections be
firm as adamant, cling closely to Dutyâ€™s apron-strings, but do not too
blindly copy after your groom. Try to stand up on your own feet, and be
a helpmate to him, not a dead weight for him to carry. Do branch right
out, and tell what part of the fowl, or of life, you want, if it hainâ€™t
nothinâ€™ but the gizzard or neck; and then try to get it. If you donâ€™t
have any self-reliance, if you donâ€™t try to help yourself any, it is
highly probable to me, that you wonâ€™t get any thing more out of the
NA
She blushed, and said she would. And so Duty beinâ€™ appeased, and
attended to, I calmly pursued my own meal.
The next morning Cicely was so beat out that she couldnâ€™t get up at
all. She wuznâ€™t sick, only jest tired out. And so the boy and I sot out
alone.
I told Cicely I would do my errents the first thing, so as to leave my
mind and my conscience clear for the rest of my stay.
[Illustration: SAMANTHA ADVISING THE BRIDE.]
And I knew there wuz a good many who would feel hurt, deeply hurt, if I
didnâ€™t notice â€˜em right off the first thing. The President, and lots of
â€˜em, I knew would take it right to heart, and feel dretfully worked up
and slighted, if I didnâ€™t call on â€˜em.
And then, I had to carry Dorleskyâ€™s errent to the President anyway. And
I thought I would tend to it right away, so I sot out in good season.
When you are a noticinâ€™ anybody, and makinâ€™ â€˜em perfectly happy, you
feel well yourself. I was in good spirits, and quite a number of â€˜em.
The boy wus feelinâ€™ well too. He had a little black velvet suit and a
deep lace collar, and his gold curls was a hanginâ€™ down under his little
black velvet cap. They made him look more babyish; but I believe Cicely
kept â€˜em so to make him look young, she felt so dubersome about his
future. But he looked sweet enough to kiss right there in the street.
I, too, looked well, very. I had on that new dress, Bismark brown, the
color remindinâ€™ me of 2 noble patriots. And made by a Martha. I thought
of that proudly, as I looked at Georgeâ€™s benign face on the top of
the monument, and wondered what heâ€™d say if he see it, and hefted my
emotions I had when causinâ€™ it to be made for my tower. I realized as
I meandered along, that patriotism wus enwrappinâ€™ me from head to foot;
for my polynay was long, and my head was completely full of Gassâ€™es
NA
I wus carryinâ€™ Dorleskyâ€™s errents.
On the outside of my head I had a good honorable shirred silk bunnet,
the color of my dress, a good solid brown (that same color, B. B.). And
my usial long green veil, with a lute-string ribbon run in, hung down on
one side of my bunnet in its wonted way.
It hung gracefully, and yet it seemed to me there wus both dignity and
principle in its hang. It give me a sort of a dressy look, but none too
dressy.
And so we wended our way down the broad, beautiful streets towards the
White House.
[Illustration: SAMANTHA AND PAUL ON THE WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE.]
Handsomer streets I never see. I had thought Jonesville streets wus
middlinâ€™ handsome and roomy. Why, two double wagons can go by each other
with perfect safety, right in front of the grocery stores, where there
is lots of boxes too; and wimmen can be a walkinâ€™ there too at the same
time, hefty ones.
But, good land! Loads of hay could pass each other here, and droves of
dromedaries, and camels, and not touch each other, and then there
would be lots of room for men and wimmen, and for wagons to rumble, and
perioguers to float up and down,--if perioguers could sail on dry land.
Roomier, handsomer, well shadeder streets I never want to see, nor donâ€™t
expect to. Why, Jonesville streets are like tape compared with â€˜em; and
Loontown and Toad Holler, they are like thread, No. 50 (allegory).
Bub Smith wus well acquainted with the Presidentâ€™s hired man, so he let
us in without parlay.
I donâ€™t believe in talkin big as a general thing. But thinksâ€™es I, Here
I be, a holdinâ€™ up the dignity of Jonesville: and here I be, on a deep,
heart-searchinâ€™ errent to the Nation. So I said, in words and axents
NA
NA
NA
He said he was, but said sunthinâ€™ about his not receiving calls in the
mornings.
But I says in a very polite way,--for I like to put folks at their ease,
presidents or peddlers or any thing,--
â€œIt hainâ€™t no matter at all if he hainâ€™t dressed up--of course he wuznâ€™t
NA
NA
Says I, â€œThat hainâ€™t no news to me, nor the Nation. We have been a
hearinâ€™ that for three years, right along. And if he is engaged, it
hainâ€™t no good reason why he shouldnâ€™t speak to other wimmen,--good,

NA
NA
off on a short tower, without takinâ€™ a pack of cards with me. And if
I had â€˜em right here in my pocket, or a set of dominoes, I shouldnâ€™t
expect to take up the time of the President of the United States a
NA
NA
He blushed up red; he was ashamed; and he said â€œhe would see if I could
NA
And he led the way along, and I follered, and the boy. Bub Smith had
left us at the door.
The hired man seemed to think I would want to look round some; and he
walked sort oâ€™ slow, out of courtesy. But, good land! how little that
hired man knew my feelinâ€™s, as he led me on, I a thinkinâ€™ to myself,--
NA
of my feelinâ€™s! The nobility of â€˜em! and the quantity! Why, it was a
perfect sight.
But right into these exalted sentiments the hired man intruded with his
frivolous remarks,--worse than frivolous.
He says agin something about â€œnot knowinâ€™ whether the President would be
NA
And I stepped down sudden from that lofty piller I had trod on in my
mind, and says I,--
â€œI tell you agin, I donâ€™t care whether he is dressed up or not. I come
NA
NA
NA
But I kepâ€™ my head right up in the air nobly, and never turned to the
right or the left; and says I,--
â€œI donâ€™t see no beauty in cuttinâ€™ up didos, nor never did. I have heard
that they did such things here in Washington, D.C., but I do not choose
NA
NA
blow aginst my conscience;â€™ and I says in milder axents,--
â€œIf I looked upon a dido at all, it would be, not with a human womanâ€™s
eye, but the eye of a Methodist. My duty draws me:--point out the dido,
NA
NA
And I says, â€œWhy couldnâ€™t you say so in the first place? The idee of

The walls wus perfectly beautiful, and so wus the ceilinâ€™ and floors.
There wuznâ€™t a house in Jonesville that could compare with it, though
we had painted our meetin-house over at a cost of upwards of 28 dollars.
But it didnâ€™t come up to this--not half. President Arthur has got good
taste; and I thought to myself, and I says to the hired man, as I looked
round and see the soft richness and quiet beauty and grandeur of the
surroundings,--
â€œI had just as lives have him pick me out a calico dress as to pick it
NA
putickuler in calico: richness and beauty is what I look out for, and
NA
Jest as I wus sayinâ€™ this, the hired man opened a door into a lofty,
beautiful room; and says he,--
â€œStep in here, madam, into the antick room, and Iâ€™ll see if the
NA
jest turned round and looked after him, for I wanted to enquire into
it. I had heard of their cuttinâ€™ up anticks at Washington,--I had come
prepared for it; but I didnâ€™t know as they was bold enough to come right
out, and have rooms devoted to that purpose. And I looked all round the
room before I ventured in. But it looked neat as a pin, and not a soul
in there; and thinksâ€™es I, â€œIt hainâ€™t probable their day for cuttinâ€™ up
NA
But I sot pretty near the edge of the chair, ready to jump at the first
thing I didnâ€™t like. And I kepâ€™ a close holt of the boy. I felt that I
was right in the midst of dangers. I had feared and foreboded,--oh,
how I had feared and foreboded about the dangers and deep perils of
Washington, D.C.! And here I wuz, the very first thing, invited right in
broad daylight, with no excuse or any thing, right into a antick room.
Oh, how thankful, how thankful I wuz, that Josiah Allen wuznâ€™t there!
I knew, as he felt a good deal of the time, an antick room was what he
would choose out of all others. And I felt stronger than ever the deep
resolve that Josiah Allen should not run. He must not be exposed to such
dangers, with his mind as it wuz, and his heft. I felt that he would
suckumb.
And I wondered that President Arthur, who I had always heard was a
perfect gentleman, should come to have a room called like that, but
sâ€™posed it was there when he went. I donâ€™t believe heâ€™d countenance any
thing of the kind.
I was jest a thinkinâ€™ this when the hired man come back, and said,--
NA
NA
So I follered him; and he led the way into a beautiful room,
kinder round, and red colored, with lots of elegant pictures and
lookinâ€™-glasses and books.
The President sot before a table covered with books and papers: and,
good land! he no need to have been afraid and hung back; he was dressed
up slick--slick enough for meetinâ€™, or a parinâ€™-bee, or any thing. He
had on a sort of a gray suit, and a rose-bud in his button-hole.
He was a good-lookinâ€™ man, though he had a middlinâ€™ tired look in his
kinder brown eyes as he looked up.
[Illustration: SAMANTHA MEETING THE PRESIDENT.]
I had calculated to act noble on that occasion, as I appeared before him
who stood in the large, lofty shoes of the revered G. W., and sot in the
chair of the (nearly) angel Garfield. I had thought that likely as
not, entirely unbeknown to me, I should soar right off into a eloquent
oration. For I honored him as a President. I felt like neighborinâ€™ with
him on account of his name--Allen! (That name I took at the alter of
Jonesville, and pure love.)
But how little can we calculate on future contingencies, or what we
shall do when we get there! As I stood before him, I only said what I
had said before on a similar occasion, these simple words, that yet mean
so much, so much,--
NA
He, too, was overcome by his feelinâ€™s: I see he wuz. His face looked
fairly solemn; but, as he is a perfect gentleman, he controlled himself,
and said quietly these words, that, too, have a deep import,--
NA
He then shook hands with me, and I with him. I, too, am a perfect lady.
And then he drawed up a chair for me with his own hands (hands that grip
holt of the same hellum that G. W. had gripped holt of. O soul! be calm
when I think ont), and asked me to set down; and consequently I sot.
I leaned my umberell in a easy, careless position against a adjacent
chair, adjusted my green veil in long, graceful folds,--I hainâ€™t vain,
but I like to look well,--and then I at once told him of my errents. I
told him--
â€œI had brought three errents to him from Jonesville,--one for myself,
NA
He bowed, but didnâ€™t say nothinâ€™: he looked tired. Josiah always looks
tired in the morninâ€™ when he has got his milkinâ€™ and barn-chores done,
so it didnâ€™t surprise me. And havinâ€™ calculated to tackle him on my own
errent first, consequently I tackled him.
I told him how deep my love and devotion to my pardner wuz.
NA
And I says, â€œI sâ€™pose so. I sâ€™pose such things will spread, beinâ€™ a sort
of a rarity. Iâ€™d heard that it had got out, way beyend Loontown, and all
NA
NA
NA
donâ€™t show off the brightest in hours of joy and peace. It towers up
NA
Josiah wanted to come there as senator, and what a dangerous place I had
always heard Washington wuz, and how I had felt it was impossible for
me to lay down on my goose-feather pillow at home, in peace and safety,
while my pardner was a grapplinâ€™ with dangers of which I did not know
the exact size and heft. And so I had made up my mind to come ahead of
him, as a forerunner on a tower, to see jest what the dangers wuz, and
NA
NA
chair makes me look up to you. It is a sightly place; you can see
fur: your name beinâ€™ Allen makes me feel sort oâ€™ confidential and good
NA
 Says I solemnly, â€œI ask you, Allen, not as a politician, but as a human
NA
Says he, â€œThe danger to the man and the nation depends a good deal on
NA
would not lie, neither would I brook one word against my companion, even
from myself. So I says,--
NA
But thinkinâ€™ that I must do so, if I got true information of dangers,
I went on, and told of Josiahâ€™s political aims, which I considered
dangerous to himself and the nation. And I told him of The Plan, and my
dark forebodinâ€™s about it.
The President didnâ€™t act surprised a mite. And finally he told me, what
I had always mistrusted, but never knew, that Josiah had wrote to him
all his political views and aspirations, and offered his help to the
NA
NA
NA
And then agin silence rained. He was a thinkinâ€™, I knew, on all the deep
dangers that hedged in Josiah Allen and America if he come. And a musinâ€™
on all the probable dangers of the Plan. And a thinkinâ€™ it over how
to do jest right in the matter,--right by Josiah, right by the nation,
right by me.
Finally the suspense of the moment wore onto me too deep to bear, and I
says in almost harrowinâ€™ tones of anxiety and suspense,--
â€œWould it be safe for my pardner to come to Washington? Would it be safe
NA
NA
He said, sort oâ€™ dreamily, â€œthat those views and aspirations of Josiahâ€™s
wasnâ€™t really needed at Washington, they had plenty of them there;
NA
But I says, â€œI _must_ have a plainer answer to ease my mind and heart.
NA
He looked full at me. He has got good, honest-looking eyes, and a
sensible, candid look onto him. He liked me,--I knew he did from his
looks,--a calm, Methodist-Episcopal likinâ€™,--nothinâ€™ light.
And I see in them eyes that he didnâ€™t like Josiahâ€™s political idees. I
see that he was afraid, as afraid as death of that plan; and I see that
he considered Washington a dangerous, dangerous place for grangers and
Josiah Allens to be a roaminâ€™ round in. I could see that he dreaded
the sufferinâ€™s for me and for the nation if the Hon. Josiah Allen was
elected.
NA
But still, he seemed to hate to speak; and wise, cautious conservatism,
and gentlemanly dignity, was wrote down on his linement. Even the
red rosebud in his button-hole looked dretful good-natured, but
close-mouthed.
I donâ€™t know as he would have spoke at all agin, if I hadnâ€™t uttered
NA
Pity and good feelinâ€™ then seemed to overpower for a moment the
statesman and courteous diplomat.
And he said in gentle, gracious tones, â€œIf I tell you just what I think,
I would not like to say it officially, but would say it in confidence,
NA
NA
And so I would warn everybody that it must _not_ be told.
NA
Says I, â€œThat settles it. If human efforts can avail, Josiah Allen will

Agin he reminded me that it was told to me in confidence, and agin I
want to say that it _must_ be kepâ€™.
I thanked him for his kindness. He is a perfect gentleman; and he told
me jest out of courtesy and politeness, and I know it. And I can be
very polite too. And I am naturally one of the kindest-hearted of
Jonesvillians.
So I says to him, â€œI wonâ€™t forget your kindness to me; and I want to say
NA
Says he with a sort of a tired look, as if he wus a lookinâ€™ back over a
NA
NA
I,--
â€œJosiah believes it, and Dorlesky Burpy, and lots of other
NA
vacated, a high chair under the full glare of critical inspection, is
a tegus place. I donâ€™t sâ€™pose Garfield was really an angel, but his
sufferinâ€™s and martyrdom placed him almost in that light before the
world.
â€œAnd you have filled that chair, and filled it well. With dignity and
courtesy and prudence. And we have been proud of you, Josiah and me both
NA
He brightened up: he had been afraid, I could see, that we wuznâ€™t suited
with him. And it took a load offen him. His linement looked clearer than
it had, and brighter.
NA
NA
He, too, sithed. His linement fell. I pitied him, and would gladly have
refrained from troubling him more. But duty hunched me; and when she
hunches, I have to move forward.
Says I in measured tones, each tone measurinâ€™ jest about the same,--half
duty, and half pity for him,--
â€œDorlesky Burpy sent these errents to you. She wanted intemperance done
away with--the Whiskey Ring broke right up. She wanted you to drink
nothinâ€™ stronger than root-beer when you had company to dinner, she
offerinâ€™ to send you a receipt for it from Jonesville; and she wanted
NA
He sithed hard. And never did I see a linement fall further than his
linement fell. I pitied him. I see it wus a hard stent for him, to do it
in the time she had sot.
And I says, â€œI think myself that Dorlesky is a little onreasonable. I
myself am willinâ€™ to wait till next week. But she has suffered dretfully
from intemperance, dretfully from the Rings, and dretfully from want of
Rights. And her sufferinâ€™s have made her more voyalent in her demands,
NA
And then I fairly groaned as I did the rest of the errent. But my
promise weighed on me, and Duty poked me in the side. I wus determined
to do the errent jest as I would wish a errent done for me, from
borryinâ€™ a drawinâ€™ of tea to tacklinâ€™ the nation, and tryinâ€™ to get a
little mess of truth and justice out of it.
â€œDorlesky told me to tell you that if you didnâ€™t do these things, she
would have you removed from the Presidential chair, and you should
NA
He trembled, he trembled like a popple-leaf. And I felt as if I should
sink: it seemed to me jest as if Dorlesky wus askinâ€™ too much of him,
and was threateninâ€™ too hard.
And beinâ€™ one that loves truth, I told him that Dorlesky was middlinâ€™
disagreeable, and very humbly, but she needed her rights jest as much as
if she was a dolly. And then I went on and told him all how she and her
relations had suffered from want of rights, and how dretfully she had
suffered from the Ring, till I declare, a talkin about them little
children of hern, and her agony, I got about as fierce actinâ€™ as
Dorlesky herself; and entirely unbeknown to myself, I talked powerful on
intemperance and Rings--and sound.
When I got down agin onto my feet, I see he had a sort of a worried,
anxious look; and he says,--
NA
NA
And he said somethinâ€™ about the might of the majority and the powerful
rings.
And that sot me off agin. And I talked very powerful, kinder allegored,
about allowinâ€™ a ring to be put round the United States, and let a lot
of whiskey-dealers lead her round, a pitiful sight for men and angels.
Says I, â€œHow does it look before the Nations, to see Columbia led round
NA
He seemed to think it looked bad, I knew by his looks.
NA
He murmured somethinâ€™ about the â€œrevenue that the liquor-trade brought
NA
But I says, â€œEvery penny they give, is money right out of the peopleâ€™s
pockets; and every dollar that the people pay into the liquor-traffic,
that they may give a few cents of it into the Treasury, is costinâ€™
the people three times that dollar, in the loss that intemperance
entails,--loss of labor, by the inability of drunken men to do any thing
but wobble and stagger round; loss of wealth, by all the enormous losses
of property and of taxation, of almshouses and madhouses, jails, police
forces, paupersâ€™ coffins, and the digging of the thousands and thousands
NA
â€œWouldnâ€™t it be better for the people to pay that dollar in the first
place into the Treasury, than to let it filter through the dram-sellerâ€™s
hands, and 2 or 3 cents of it fall into the National purse at last,
putrid, and heavy with all these losses and curses and crimes and shames
NA
He seemed to think it would: I see by the looks of his linement, he did.
Every honorable man feels so in his heart; and yet they let the liquor
ring control â€˜em, and lead â€˜em round.
Says I, â€œAll the intellectual and moral power of the United States are
jest rolled up and thrust into that Whiskey Ring, and are being drove
NA
controls New-York village, and nobody pretends to deny it; and all the
piety and philanthropy and culture and philosiphy of that village has

tones of principle,--
â€œWhere, where, is it a drawinâ€™ â€˜em to? Where is it a drawinâ€™ the hull
nation to? Is itâ€™ a drawinâ€™ â€˜em down into a slavery ten times more
NA
NA
His mean looked impressed, but he did not try to frame a reply. I think
he could not find a frame. There is no frame to that reply. It is a
conundrum as boundless as truth and Godâ€™s justice, and as solemnly deep
in its sure consequences of evil as eternity, and as sure to come as
that is.
Agin I says, â€œWhere is that Ring a drawinâ€™ the United States? Where is
NA
NA
polite,--a politer demeanerd, gentlemanly appeariner man I donâ€™t want to
see. â€œAh, yes! I would be glad, Josiah Allenâ€™s wife, to do her errent. I
think Dorlesky is justified in asking to have the Ring destroyed. But I
NA
NA
NA
NA
So I spoke to the boy. He had been all engaged lookinâ€™ out of the
winders, but he was willinâ€™ to go.
And the President took the boy upon his knee, wantinâ€™ to do something
agreeable, I sâ€™pose, seeinâ€™ he couldnâ€™t do the errent. And he says, jest
to make himself pleasant to the boy,--
NA
NA
And seeinâ€™ the boy seemed to be headed onto theoligy instead of
politics, and wantinâ€™ to kinder show him off, I says,--
NA
He spoke right up prompt, as if hurryinâ€™ to get through theoligy, soâ€™s
to tackle sunthinâ€™ else. He answered as exhaustively as an exhauster
could at a meetinâ€™,--
â€œI was made out of dust, and breathed into. I am made out of God and
NA
Oh, how deep, how deep that child is! I never had heard him say that
before. But how true it wuz! The divine and the human, linked so close
together from birth till death. No philosipher that ever philosiphized
could go deeper or higher.
I see the President looked impressed. But the boy branched off quick,
for he seemed fairly burstinâ€™ with questions.
NA
â€œ_Say,_ what is this house called the White House for? Is it because it
NA
I declare, I almost thought the boy had heard sunthinâ€™ about the
elections in the South, and the Congressional vote for cuttinâ€™ down
the money for the Indian schools. Legislative action to perpetuate the
ignorance and brutality of a race.
NA
â€œWell, is it called white like the gate of the City is? Mamma said that
was white,--a pearl, you know,--because every thing was pure and white
inside the City. Is it because the laws that are made here are all white
NA
Here his eyes looked dark and big with excitement.
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œIf fighting makes folks great, why did mamma punish me when I fought
with Jim Gowdey? He stole my jack-knife, and knocked me down, and set
down on me, and took my chewing-gum away from me, and chewed it himself.
And I rose against him, and we fought and bled: my nose bled, and so
did his. But I got it away from him, and chewed it myself. But mamma
punished me, and said; God wouldnâ€™t love me if I quarrelled so, and if
we couldnâ€™t agree, we must get somebody to settle our trouble for us.
Why didnâ€™t she stand me up on a big white pillow out in the door-yard,

NA
NA
NA
NA
The President waved off that question, and the boy kepâ€™ on.
â€œIs it true what you have been talkinâ€™ about,--is there a great big ring
NA
[Illustration: WAR DECLARED.]
And then the boyâ€™s eyes grew black with excitement; and he kepâ€™ right on
without waitinâ€™ for breath, or for a answer,--
â€œHe had heard it talked about, was it right to let anybody do wrong for
money? Did the United States do it? Did it make mean things right? If
it did, he wanted to get one of Tom Gowdyâ€™s white rats. He wouldnâ€™t sell
it, and he wanted it. His mother wouldnâ€™t let him steal it; but if the
United States could _make_ it right for him to do wrong, he had got ten
cents of his own, and heâ€™d buy the right to get that white rat. And if
Tom wanted to cry about it, let him. If the United States sold him the
right to do it, he guessed he could do it, no matter how much whimperinâ€™
NA
But I see the Presidentâ€™s eyes, which had looked kinder rested when he
took him up, grew bigger and bigger with surprise and anxiety. I guess
he thought he had got his dayâ€™s work in front of him. And I told the boy
we must go. And then I says to the President,--
â€œThat I knew he was quite a traveller, and of course he wouldnâ€™t want
NA
NA
so much; there haint nothinâ€™ more excitinâ€™ to shoot than red squirrels
and chipmunks: but there is quite good fishinâ€™ in the creek back of our

He smiled real agreable, and said, â€œwhen he visited Jonesville, he

Says I, â€œSo do; and, if you get lost, you jest enquire at the Corners of

NA
And then I shook hands with him, thinkinâ€™ it would be expected of me
(his hands are white, and not much bigger than Tirzah Annâ€™s). And then I
removed the boy by voyalence, for he was a askinâ€™ questions agin, faster
than ever; and he poured out over his shoulder a partinâ€™ dribble of
questions, that lasted till we got outside. And then he tackled me, and
he asked me somewhere in the neighborhood of a 1,000 questions on the
way back to Miss Smithsâ€™es.
He begun agin on George Washington jest as quick as he ketched sight of
his monument agin.
â€œIf George Washington is up on the top of that monument for tellinâ€™ the
truth, why didnâ€™t all the big men try to tell the truth soâ€™s to be stood
up on pillows outdoors, and not be a layinâ€™ down in the grass? And did
the little hatchet help him do right? If it did, why didnâ€™t all the big
men wear them in their belts to do right with, and tell the truth with?
NA
Oh, dear me suz! He asked me over 40 questions to a lamp-post, for I
counted â€˜em; and there wuz 18 posts.
Good land! Iâ€™d ruther wash than try to answer him; but he looked so
sweet and good-natured and confidinâ€™, his eyes danced so, and he was so
awful pretty, that I felt in the midst of my deep fag, that I could kiss
him right there in the street if it wuznâ€™t for the looks of it: he is a
beautiful child, and very deep.
CHAPTER VII.
Wall, after dinner I sot sail for James G. Blainsâ€™es, a walkinâ€™ afoot,
and carryinâ€™ Dorleskyâ€™s errent. I was determined to do that errent
before I slept. I am very obleeginâ€™, and am called so.
When I got to Mr. Blainesâ€™es, I was considerably tired; for though
Dorleskyâ€™s errent might not be heavy as weighed by the steelyards, yet
it was _very_ hefty and wearinâ€™ on the moral feelinâ€™s. And my firm,
unalterable determination to carry it straight, and tend to it, to the
very utmost of my ability, strained on me.
I was fagged.
But I donâ€™t believe Mr. Blaine see the fag. I shook hands with him, and
there was calmness in that shake. I passed the compliments of the
day (how do you do, etc.), and there was peace and dignity in them
compliments.
He was most probable, glad I had come. But he didnâ€™t seem quite so
over-rejoiced as he probable would if he hadnâ€™t been so busy. _I_ canâ€™t
be so highly tickled when company comes, when I am washinâ€™ and cleaninâ€™
house.
He had piles and piles of papers on the table before him. And there was
a gentleman a settinâ€™ at the end of the room a readinâ€™.
I like James G. Blainesâ€™es looks middlinâ€™ well. Although, like myself,
he donâ€™t set up for a professional beauty. It seems as if some of the
strength of the mountain pines round his old home is a holdinâ€™ up his
backbone, and some of the bracinâ€™ air of the pine woods of Maine has
blowed into Jamesâ€™es intellect, and braced it.
[Illustration: SAMANTHA MEETING JAMES G. BLAINE.]
I think enough of James, but not too much. My likinâ€™ is jest about
strong enough from a literary person to a literary person.
We are both literary, very. He is considerable taller than I am; and on
that account, and a good many others, I felt like lookinâ€™ up to him.
Wall, when I have got a hard job in front of me, I donâ€™t know any better
way than to tackle it to once. So consequently I tackled it.
I told James, that Dorlesky Burpy had sent two errents by me, and I had
brought â€˜em from Jonesville on my tower.
And then I told him jest how she had suffered from the Whisky Ring,
and how she had suffered from not havinâ€™ her rights; and I told him all
about her relations sufferinâ€™, and that Dorlesky wanted the Ring broke,
and her rights gin to her, within seven days at the longest.
He rubbed his brow thoughtfully, and says,--
NA
NA
NA
Agin he rubbed his brow in deep thought, and agin he says,--
â€œI donâ€™t think Dorlesky is unreasonable in her demands, only in the
NA
Says I, â€œThat is jest what I told Dorlesky. I didnâ€™t believe you could
do her errents this week. But you can see for yourself that she is
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
And then come the very hardest part of my errent. But I had to do it, I
had to.
Says I, in the deep, solemn tones befitting the threat, for I wuznâ€™t
the woman to cheat Dorlesky when she was out of sight, and use the
wrong tones at the wrong times--no, I used my deepest and most skairful
one--says I, â€œDorlesky told me to tell you that if you didnâ€™t do her
NA
He turned pale. He looked agitated, fearful agitated.
I sâ€™pose it was not only my words and tone that skairt him, but my
mean. I put on my noblest mean; and I sâ€™pose I have got a very noble,
high-headed mean at times. I got it, I think, in the first place, by
overlookinâ€™ Josiahâ€™s faults. I always said a wife ort to overlook her
husbandâ€™s faults; and I have to overlook so many, that it has made me
about as high-headed, sometimes, as a warlike gander, but more sort oâ€™
meller-lookinâ€™, and sublime, kinder.
He stood white as a piece of a piller-case, and seeminâ€™ly plunged down
into the deepest thought. But finally he riz part way out of it, and
says he,--
â€œI want to be on the side of Truth and Justice. I want to, awfully. And
while I do not want to be President of the United States, yet at the
NA
NA
NA
sot quietly in the rain, thinkinâ€™ mebby good would come of it.
Finally he riz out of his revery; and says he, with a brighter look on
his linement,--
NA
NA
NA
Says I, â€œIâ€™ll send Bub Smith to Senator Loganâ€™ses the minute I get
back; for much as I want to obleege a neighbor, I canâ€™t traipse all over
Washington, walkinâ€™ afoot, and carryinâ€™ Dorleskyâ€™s errent. But Bub
NA
gentleman; and, as I said, I like his looks. He has got that grand sort
of a noble look, I have seen in other literary people, or has been seen
in â€˜em; but modesty forbids my sayinâ€™ a word further.
But jest at this minute Mr. Blainesâ€™es hired man come in, and told him
that he was wanted below; and he took up his hat and gloves.
But jest as he was startinâ€™ out, he says, turninâ€™ to the other gentleman
in the room,--
â€œThis gentleman is a senator. Mebby he can do Dorleskyâ€™s errent for
NA
NA
further. It would tickle Dorlesky most to death, and lots and lots of
NA
Mr. Blaine spoke to the gentleman; and he come forward, and Mr. Blaine
introduced us. But I didnâ€™t ketch his name; because, jest as Mr. Blaine
spoke it, my umberell fell, and the gentleman sprung forward to pick it
up; and then he shook hands with me: and Mr. Blaine said good-bye to me,
and started off.
I felt willinâ€™ and glad to have this senator do Dorleskyâ€™s errents, but
I didnâ€™t like his looks from the very first minute I sot my eyes on him.
My land! talk about Dorlesky Burpy beinâ€™ disagreable--he wus as
disagreable as she is, any day. He was kinder tall, and looked out of
his eyes, and wore a vest: I donâ€™t know as I can describe him any more
close than that. He was some bald-headed, and he kinder smiled once in
a while: I persume he will be known by this description. It is plain,
anyway, almost lucid.
[Illustration: MR. BLAINE INTRODUCING THE SENATOR.]
But his baldness didnâ€™t look to me like Josiah Allenâ€™s baldness; and he
didnâ€™t have a mite of that smart, straight-forward way of Blaine, or the
perfect courtesy and kindness of Allen Arthur. No. I sort oâ€™ despised
him from the first minute.
Wall, he was dretful polite: good land! politeness is no name for his
mean. Truly, as Josiah Allen says, I donâ€™t like to see anybody too good.
He drawed a chair up, for me and for himself, and asked me,--
â€œIf he should have the inexpressible honor and the delightful joy of
NA
effect. I canâ€™t put down his smiles, and genteel looks, and donâ€™t want
to if I could.
But tacklinâ€™ hard jobs as I always tackle â€˜em, I sot right down calmly
in front of him, with my umberell acrost my lap, and told him over all
of Dorleskyâ€™s errents. And how I had brought â€˜em from Jonesville on my
tower. I told over all of her sufferinâ€™s, from the Ring, and from not
havinâ€™ her rights; and all her sister Susan Clapsaddleâ€™s sufferinâ€™s;
and all her aunt Euniceâ€™s and Pattyâ€™s, and Drusillaâ€™s and Abagailâ€™s,
sufferinâ€™s. I did her errent up honorable and square, as I would love
to have a errent done for me. I told him all the particulers; and as I
finished, I said firmly,--
NA
He leaned forward with that deceitful and sort of disagreable smile of
hisen, and took up one corner of my mantilly. It wus cut tab fashion;
and he took up the tab, and says he, in a low, insinuatinâ€™ voice, and
lookinâ€™ close at the edge of the tab,--
NA
I jest drawed the tab back coldly, and never dained a reply.
Again he says, in a tone of amiable anxiety,--
â€œHave I not heard a rumor that bangs were going out of style? I see you
do not wear your lovely hair bang-like, or a pompidorus! Ah! wimmen
NA
NA
love-sick sithe.
I sot demute as the Sfinx, and a chippinâ€™-bird a tappinâ€™ his wing
against her stunny breast would move it jest as much as he moved me
by his talk or his sithes. But he kepâ€™ on, puttinâ€™ on a kind of a sad,
injured look, as if my coldness wus ondoinâ€™ of him,--
â€œMy dear madam, it is my misfortune that the topics I introduce, however
carefully selected by me, do not seem to be congenial to you. Have you
a leaning toward natural history, madam? Have you ever studied into the

NA
NA
â€œThe wad. The animal from which is obtained the valuable fur that

NA

NA
Truly, I had heard much of the flattery and the little talk that
statesmen will use to wimmen, and I had heard much of their lies, etc.;
but truly, I felt that the 1/2 had not been told. And then I thought out
loud, and says,--
â€œI have hearn how laws of right and justice are sot one side in
Washington, D.C., as beinâ€™ too triflinâ€™ to attend to, while the
legislators pondered over, and passed laws regardinâ€™, hensâ€™ eggs and

â€œI shall do Dorleskyâ€™s errents, and do â€˜em to the best of my ability;
and you canâ€™t draw off my attention from her sufferinâ€™s and her

Says I firmly, â€œThat hainâ€™t no such thing. They are disagreable creeters
a good deal of the time. They hainâ€™t no better than men. But they ought
to have their rights all the same. Now, Dorlesky is disagreable, and
kinder fierce actinâ€™, and jest as humbly as they make wimmen; but that
hainâ€™t no sign she ort to be imposed upon. Josiah says, â€˜She hadnâ€™t ort
to have a right, not a single right, because she is so humbly.â€™ But I
NA
NA
NA
â€œAh! your husband! yes, wimmen should have husbands instead of
rights. They do not need rights, they need freedom from all cares and
sufferings. Sweet, lovely beings, let them have husbands to lift them
NA
liftinâ€™ his eyes to the heavens, and kinder shettinâ€™ â€˜em, some as if he
was goinâ€™ into a trance, â€œfly around, ye angels, in your native haunts!
NA
And he kinder moved his hand back and forth, in a floatinâ€™ fashion, up
in the air, as if it was a woman a flyinâ€™ up there, smooth and serene.
It would have impressed some folks dretful, but it didnâ€™t me. I says
reasonably,--
â€œDorlesky would have been glad to flew above â€˜em. But the ring and the
vile laws laid holt of her, unbeknown to her, and dragged her down.
And there she is, all dragged and bruised and brokenhearted by it. She
didnâ€™t meddle with the political ring, but the ring meddled with her.
How can she fly when the weight of this infamous traffic is a holdinâ€™
NA
NA
NA
these angelic angels of our homes are too ethereal, too dainty, to
mingle with the rude crowds. We political men would fain keep them
as they are now: we are willing to stand the rude buffetings
of--of--voting, in order to guard these sweet, delicate creatures from
any hardships. Sweet, tender beings, we would fain guard you--ah, yes!
NA
[Illustration: WOMANâ€™S RIGHTS.]
Says I, â€œCease instantly, or my sickness will increase; for such talk
NA
and I know, that these angelic, tender beinâ€™s, half clothed, fill our
streets on icy midnights, huntinâ€™ up drunken husbands and fathers and
sons. They are driven to death and to moral ruin by the miserable want
liquor-drinkinâ€™ entails. They are starved, they are frozen, they are
beaten, they are made childless and hopeless, by drunken husbands
killing their own flesh and blood. They go down into the cold waves, and
are drowned by drunken captains; they are cast from railways into death,
by drunken engineers; they go up on the scaffold, and die of crimes
committed by the direct aid of this agent of hell.
[Illustration: SOMEBODY BLUNDERED.]
â€œWimmen had ruther be a flyinâ€™ round than to do all this, but they
canâ€™t. If men really believe all they say about wimmen, and I think some
of â€˜em do, in a dreamy way--if wimmen are angels, give â€˜em the rights of
angels. Who ever heard of a angel foldinâ€™ up her wings, and goinâ€™ to a
poorhouse or jail through the fault of somebody else? Who ever heard
of a angel beinâ€™ dragged off to a police court by a lot of men, for
fightinâ€™ to defend her children and herself from a drunken husband that
had broke her wings, and blacked her eyes, himself, got the angel into
the fight, and then she got throwed into the streets and the prison by
it? Who ever heard of a angel havinâ€™ to take in washinâ€™ to support a
drunken son or father or husband? Who ever heard of a angel goinâ€™ out as
wet nurse to get money to pay taxes on her home to a Government that in
theory idolizes her, and practically despises her, and uses that same
money in ways abomenable to that angel?
â€œIf you want to be consistent--if you are bound to make angels of
wimmen, you ort to furnish a free, safe place for â€˜em to soar in. You
ort to keep the angels from beinâ€™ meddled with, and bruised, and killed,
NA
NA
But I kepâ€™ right on, for I begun to feel noble and by the side of
myself.
â€œThis talk about wimmen beinâ€™ outside and above all participation in the
laws of her country, is jest as pretty as I ever heard any thing, and
jest as simple. Why, you might jest as well throw a lot of snowflakes
into the street, and say, â€˜Some of â€˜em are female flakes, and mustnâ€™t
be trampled on.â€™ The great march of life tramples on â€˜em all alike: they
fall from one common sky, and are trodden down into one common ground.
â€œMen and wimmen are made with divine impulses and desires, and human
needs and weaknesses, needinâ€™ the same heavenly light, and the same
human aids and helps. The law should meet out to them the same rewards
and punishments.
â€œDorlesky says you call wimmens angels, and you donâ€™t give â€˜em the
rights of the lowest beasts that crawls upon the earth. And Dorlesky
told me to tell you that she didnâ€™t ask the rights of a angel: she would
be perfectly contented and proud if you would give her the rights of a
dog--the assured political rights of a yeller dog. She said â€˜yeller;â€™
and I am bound on doinâ€™ her errent jest as she wanted me to, word for
word.
â€œA dog, Dorlesky says, donâ€™t have to be hung if it breaks the laws it
is not allowed any hand in making. A dog donâ€™t have to pay taxes on its
bone to a Government that withholds every right of citizenship from it.
â€œA dog hainâ€™t called undogly if it is industrious, and hunts quietly
round for its bone to the best of its ability, and wants to get its
share of the crumbs that fall from that table that bills are laid on.
â€œA dog hainâ€™t preached to about its duty to keep home sweet and sacred,
and then see that home turned into a place of torment under laws that
these very preachers have made legal and respectable.
â€œA dog donâ€™t have to see its property taxed to advance laws that it
believes ruinous, and that breaks its own heart and the hearts of other
dear dogs.
â€œA dog donâ€™t have to listen to soul-sickening speeches from them that
deny it freedom and justice--about its beinâ€™ a damosk rose, and a
seraphine, when it knows it hainâ€™t: it knows, if it knows any thing,
that it is a dog.
â€œYou see, Dorlesky has been kinder embittered by her trials that
politics, corrupt legislation, has brought right onto her. She didnâ€™t
want nothinâ€™ to do with â€˜em; but they come right onto her unexpected and
unbeknown, and she feels jest so. She feels she must do every thing she
can to alter matters. She wants to help make the laws that have such
a overpowerinâ€™ influence over her, herself. She believes from her soul
that they canâ€™t be much worse than they be now, and may be a little

â€œAh! if Dorlesky wishes to influence political affairs, let her

â€œBut the law has took her boy, her little boy and girl, away from her.

â€œPardon me, madam; but if you are happy, as you say, in your marriage
relations, and your husband is a temperate, good man, why do you feel so
NA
â€œWhy, good land! if you understand the nature of a woman, you would know
that my love for him, my happiness, the content and safety I feel about
him, and our boy, makes me realize the sufferinâ€™s of Dorlesky in havinâ€™
her husband and boy lost to her, makes me realize the depth of a wiveâ€™s,
of a motherâ€™s, agony, when she sees the one she loves goinâ€™ down, goinâ€™
down so low that she canâ€™t reach him; makes me feel how she must yearn
to help him in some safe, sure way.
â€œHigh trees cast long shadows. The happier and more blessed a womanâ€™s
life is, the more does she feel for them who are less blessed than she.
Highest love goes lowest, if need be. Witness the love that left Heaven,
and descended onto the earth, and into it, that He might lift up the
lowly.
â€œThe pityinâ€™ words of Him who went about pleasinâ€™ not himself, hants me,
and inspires me. I am sorry for Dorlesky, sorry for the hull wimmen
race of the nation--and for the men too. Lots of â€˜em are good
creeters--better than wimmen, some on â€˜em. They want to do jest about
right, but donâ€™t exactly see the way to do it. In the old slavery times,
some of the masters was more to be pitied than the slaves. They could
see the injustice, feel the wrong, they was doinâ€™; but old chains of
custom bound â€˜em, social customs and idees had hardened into habits of
thought.
â€œThey realized the size and heft of the evil, but didnâ€™t know how to
grapple with it, and throw it.
â€œSo now, many men see the great evils of this time, want to help it, but
donâ€™t know the best way to lay holt of it.
â€œLife is a curious conundrum anyway, and hard to guess. But we can try
to get the right answer to it as fur as we can. Dorlesky feels that one
of the answers to the conundrum is in gettinâ€™ her rights. She feels jest
so.
â€œI myself have got all the rights I need, or want, as fur as my own
happiness is concerned. My home is my castle (a story and a half wooden
one, but dear).
â€œMy towers elevate me, the companionship of my friends give social
happiness, our children are prosperous and happy. We have property
enough, and more than enough, for all the comforts of life. And, above
NA
NA
find her full content--her entire happiness and thought. A womanly woman
NA
Says I firmly, â€œIf she hainâ€™t a idiot, she canâ€™t help it. Love is the
most beautiful thing on earth, the most holy, the most satisfyinâ€™. But
which would you like best--I do not ask you as a politician, but as a
human beinâ€™--which would you like best, the love of a strong, earnest,
tender nature--for in man or woman, â€˜the strongest are the tenderest,
the loving are the daringâ€™--which would you like best, the love and
respect of such a nature, full of wit, of tenderness, of infinite
variety, or the love of a fool?
â€œA foolâ€™s love is wearinâ€™: it is insipid at the best, and it turns to
viniger. Why! sweetened water _must_ turn to viniger: it is its nater.
And, if a woman is bright and true-hearted, she canâ€™t help seemâ€™ through
a injustice. She may be happy in her own home. Domestic affection,
social enjoyments, the delights of a cultured home and society, and the
companionship of the man she loves, and who loves her, will, if she is
a true woman, satisfy fully her own personal needs and desires; and she
would far rather, for her own selfish happiness, rest quietly in that
love--that most blessed home.
â€œBut the bright, quick intellect that delights you, canâ€™t help seeing
through an injustice, canâ€™t help seeing through shams of all kinds--sham
sentiment, sham compliments, sham justice.
â€œThe tender, lovinâ€™ nature that blesses your life, canâ€™t help feelinâ€™
pity for those less blessed than herself. She looks down through the
love-guarded lattice of her home,--from which your care would fain bar
out all sights of woe and squalor,--she looks down, and sees the weary
toilers below, the hopeless, the wretched; she sees the steep hills they
have to climb, carry inâ€™ their crosses; she sees â€˜em go down into the
mire, dragged there by the love that should lift â€˜em up.
â€œShe would not be the woman you love, if she could restrain her hand
from liftinâ€™ up the fallen, wipinâ€™ tears from weepinâ€™ eyes, speakinâ€™
brave words for them who canâ€™t speak for themselves.
â€œThe very strength of her affection that would hold you up, if you were
in trouble or disgrace, yearns to help all sorrowinâ€™ hearts.
â€œDown in your heart, you canâ€™t help admirinâ€™ her for this: we canâ€™t help
respectinâ€™ the one who advocates the right, the true, even if they are
our conquerors.
â€œWimmen hainâ€™t angels: now, to be candid, you know they hainâ€™t. They
hainâ€™t better than men. Men are considerable likely; and it seems
curious to me, that they should act so in this one thing. For men ort
to be more honest and open than wimmen. They hainâ€™t had to cajole and
wheedle, and spile their natures, through little trickeries and deceits,
and indirect ways, that wimmen has.
â€œWhy, cramp a tree-limb, and see if it will grow as straight and
vigorous as it would in full freedom and sunshine.
â€œMen ort to be nobler than wimmen, sincerer, braver. And they ort to be
ashamed of this one trick of theirn; for they know they hainâ€™t honest in
it, they hainâ€™t generous.
â€œGive wimmen 2 or 3 generations of moral freedom, and see if men will
laugh at â€˜em for their little deceits and affectations.
â€œNo: men will be gentler, and wimmen nobler; and they will both come
nearer beinâ€™ angels, though most probable they wonâ€™t be angels: they

redemption of the world through the birth of the Christ,--no man had
any thing to do with that whatever. Our divine Lord was born of God and
woman.
â€œHeavenly plan of redemption for fallen humanity. God Himself called
women into that work,--the divine work of helpinâ€™ a world.
â€œGod called her. Mary had no dream of publicity, no desire for a worldâ€™s
work of sufferinâ€™ and renunciation. The soft airs of Gallilee wrapped
her about in its sweet content, as she dreamed her quiet dreams
in maiden peace, dreamed, perhaps, of domestic love and quiet and
happiness.
â€œFrom that sweetest silence, the restful peace of happy, innocent
girlhood, God called her to her divine work of helpinâ€™ to redeem a world
from sin.
â€œAnd did not this womanâ€™s love, and willinâ€™ obedience, and sufferinâ€™,
and the shame of the world, set her apart, babtize her for this work of
liftinâ€™ up the fallen, helpinâ€™ the weak?
â€œIs it not a part of womanâ€™s life that she gave at the birth and the
crucifixion?--her faith, her hope, her sufferinâ€™, her glow of divine
pity and joyful martyrdom. These, mingled with the divine, the pure
heavenly, have they not for 1800 years been blessinâ€™ the world? The God
in Christ would awe us too much: we would shield our faces from the too
blindinâ€™ glare of the pure God-like. But the tender Christ, who wept
over a sinful city, and the grave of His friend, who stopped dyinâ€™ upon
the cross, to comfort his motherâ€™s heart, provide for her future--it is
this element in our Lordâ€™s nature that makes us dare to approach Him,
dare to kneel at His feet.
â€œAnd since woman wus so blessed as to be counted worthy to be co-worker
with God in the beginninâ€™ of a worldâ€™s redemption; since He called her
from the quiet obscurity of womanly rest and peace, into the blessed
martyrdom of renunciation and toil and sufferinâ€™, all to help a world
that cared nothing for her, that cried out shame upon her,--will He
not help her to carry on the work that she helped commence? Will He not
approve of her continuinâ€™ in it? Will He not protect her in it?
â€œYes: she cannot be harmed, since His care is over her; and the cause
she loves, the cause of helpinâ€™ men and wimmen, is Godâ€™s cause too,
and God will take care of His own. Herods full of greed, and frightened
selfishness, may try to break her heart, by efforts to kill the child
she loves; but she will hold it so close to her bosom, that he canâ€™t
destroy it. And the light of the divine will go before her, showinâ€™
the way she must go, over the desert, maybe; but she shall bear it into

He had the strength to lead the way, to overcome obsticles, to keep
dangers from Mary, to protect her tenderer form with the mantilly of his
generous devotion.

â€œ_But she carried the child on her bosom_. Pondering high things in her

enable her to carry it through. He will protect her from her own
weaknesses, and from the misapprehensions and hard judgments and
injustices of a gain-saying world.

â€œWell, yes, yes--I would love to--as it were--But really, my dear madam,
much as I would like to oblige you, I have not the time to devote to it.
We senators and Congressmen are so driven, and hard-worked, that really
we have no time to devote to the cause of Right and Justice. I donâ€™t
think you realize the constant pressure of hard work, that is ageing us,
and wearing us out, before our day.
â€œAs I said, we have to watch the liquor-interest constantly, to see that
the liquor-dealers suffer no loss--we _have_ to do that. And then, we

begrudge labor if we can advance measures of economy. You see, it
was taking sights of money just to Christianize and civilize
Injuns--savages. Why, the idea was worse than useless, it wus perfectly
ruinous to the Indian agents. For if, through those schools, the Indians
had got to be self-supporting and intelligent and Christians, why, the
agents couldnâ€™t buy their wives and daughters for a yard of calico,
or get them drunk, and buy a horse for a glass bead, and a farm for a
pocket lookinâ€™-glass. Well, thank fortune, we carried that important
measure through; we voted strong; we cut down the money anyway. And
there is one revenue that is still accruing to the Government--or, as it

As I wended, my way out of Mr. Blainsâ€™es, I met the hired man, Bub
Smithâ€™s friend; and he asked me,--
NA
NA
NA
NA
And he said he was going right by there on business, and he would be
glad to show it to me. So we walked along in that direction.
It seems that Bub Smith saved the life of his little sister--jumped off
into the water when she was most drowned, and dragged her out. And from
that time the two families have thought the world of each other. That is
what made him so awful good to me.
Wall, I found the Capitol was a sight to behold! Why, it beat any
buildinâ€™ in Jonesville, or Loontown, or Spoon Settlement in beauty and
size and grandeur. There hainâ€™t one that can come nigh it. Why, take all
the meetinâ€™-housen of these various places, and put â€˜em all together,
and put several other meetinâ€™-housen on top of â€˜em, and they wouldnâ€™t
begin to show off with it.
And, oh! my land! to stand in the hall below, and look up--and up--and
up--and see all the colors of the rainbow, and see what kinder curious
and strange pictures there wuz way up there in the sky above me (as it
were). Why, it seemed curiouser than any Northern lights I ever see in
my life, and they stream up dretful curious sometimes.
And as I walked through the various lofty and magnificent halls, and
realized the size and majestic proportions of the buildinâ€™, I wondered
to myself that a small law, a little, unjust law, could ever be passed
in such a magnificent place.
[Illustration: SAMANTHA VIEWING THE CAPITOL.]
Says I to myself, â€œIt canâ€™t be the fault of the place, anyway. They have
NA
is room and to spare, to pass by laws big as elephants and camels. And
I wondered to myself that they should ever try to pass laws and
resolutions as small as muskeeters and nats. Thinksâ€™es I, I wonder
them little laws donâ€™t get to strollinâ€™ round and get lost in them
magnificent corriders. But I consoled myself a thinkinâ€™ that it wouldnâ€™t
be no great loss if they did.
But right here, as I was a thinkinâ€™ on these deep and lofty subjects,
the hired man spoke up; and says he,--

what he meant.

strange ways there in Washington, anyway. And I didnâ€™t know but it was
their way to make some presents to every woman who come there: and I
didnâ€™t want to be odd, and act awkward, and out of style; so I says,--
â€œI donâ€™t want to take any thing, and I donâ€™t see any reason why you

had got to take a present from a strange man, I would make a shirt for

Which he did, and I was glad enough to get out into the pure air.
When I got back to the house, I found they had been to supper. Sally had
had company that afternoon,--her husbandâ€™s brother. He had jest left.
He lived only a few miles away, and had come in on the cars. Sally said
he wanted to stay and see me the worst kind: he wanted to throw out some
deep arguments aginst wimmenâ€™s suffrage. Says she, â€œHe talks powerful
NA
NA
She said he had to hurry home on account of business. He had come in
to the village, to get some money. There was goinâ€™ to be a lot of men,
wimmen, and children sold in his neighborhood the next morninâ€™, and he
thought he should buy a girl, if he could find a likely one.

to the highest bidder,--sell their labor by the year. They have â€˜em get
up on a auction block, and hire a auctioneer, and sell â€˜em at so much a
head, to the crowd. Why, some of â€˜em bring as high as twenty dollars a
year, besides board.
[Illustration: BUYING TIME.]
â€œSometimes, he said, there was quite a run on old wimmen, and another
year on young ones. He didnâ€™t know but he might buy a old woman. He said
there was an old woman that he thought there was a good deal of work in,
yet. She had belonged to one of the first families in the State, and
had come down to poverty late in life, through the death of some of
her relations, and the villany of others. So he thought she had more
strength in her than if she had always been worked. He thought, if she
didnâ€™t fetch too big a price, he should buy her instead of a young one.
They was so balky, he said, young ones was, and would need more to eat,
beinâ€™ growinâ€™. And she could do rough, heavy work, just as well as a
younger one, and probably wouldnâ€™t complain so much; and he thought she
would last a year, anyway. It was his way, he said, to put â€˜em right
NA
I sithed; and says I, â€œI feel to lament that I wuznâ€™t here soâ€™s he could
NA
NA
NA
I didnâ€™t say no more. Good land! Sally hainâ€™t to blame. But with a noble
scorn filling my eye, and floating out the strings of my head-dress, I
moved off to bed.
Wall, the next morninâ€™ I sent Dorleskyâ€™s errents by Bub Smith to William
Wallace, for I felt a good deal fagged out. Bub did â€˜em well, and I know
it.
But William Wallace sent him to Gen. Logan.
And Gen. Logan said Grover Cleveland was the one to go to: he wuz a
sot man, and would do as he agreed. And Mr. Cleveland sent him to Mr.
Edmunds.
And Mr. Edmunds told him to go to Samuel G. Tilden, or Roswell P.
Flower.
And Mr. Flower sent him to William Walter Phelps.
And Mr. Phelps said that Benjamin P. Butler or Mr. Bayard was the one to
do the errent.
And Mr. Bayard sent him to somebody else, and somebody else sent him to
another one. And so it went on; and Bub Smith traipsed round, a carryinâ€™
them errents, from one man to another, till he was most dead.
Why, he carried them errents round all day, walkinâ€™ afoot.
Bub said most every one of â€˜em said the errents wuz just and right, but
they couldnâ€™t do â€˜em, and wouldnâ€™t tell their reasons.
One or two, Bub said, opposed it, because they said right out plain,
â€œthat they wanted to drink. They wanted to drink every thing they could,
and everywhere they could,--hard cider and beer, and brandy and whisky,
NA
And they didnâ€™t want wimmen to vote, because they liked to have the
power in their own hands: they loved to control things, and kinder boss
round--loved to dearly.
These was open-hearted men who spoke as they felt. But they was
exceptions. Most every one of â€˜em said they couldnâ€™t do it, and wouldnâ€™t
tell their reasons.
Till way along towards night, a senator he had been sent to, beinâ€™
a little in liquor at the time, and beinâ€™ talkative; he owned up the
reasons why the senators wouldnâ€™t do the errents.
He said they all knew in their own hearts, both of the errents was right
and just, to their own souls and their own country. He said--for the
liquor had made him _very_ open-hearted and talkative--that they knew
the course they was pursuinâ€™ in regard to intemperance was a crime
against God and their own consciences. But they didnâ€™t dare to tackle
unpopular subjects.
He said they knew they was elected by liquor, a good many of them,
and they knew, if they voted against whisky, it would deprive â€˜em of
thousands and thousands of voters, dillegent voters, who would vote for
â€˜em from morn inâ€™ till night, and so they dassent tackle the ring. And
if wimmen was allowed to vote, they knew it was jest the same thing as
breaking the ring right in two, and destroying intemperance. So, though
they knew that both the errents was jest as right as right could be,
they dassent tackle â€˜em, for fear they wouldnâ€™t run no chance at all of
beinâ€™ President of the United States.

reason, if it is a poor one. I didnâ€™t know but they sent you round jest
NA
Wall, the next morninâ€™ I told Bub to carry the errents right into the
Senate. Says I, â€œYou have took â€˜em one by one, alone, now you jest carry
NA
hull crew on â€˜em. So he jest walked right into the Senate, a carryinâ€™
Dorleskyâ€™s errents.
And he come back skairt. He said, jest as he was a carryinâ€™ Dorleskyâ€™s
errents in, a long petition come from thousands and thousands of wimmen
on this very subject. A plea for justice and mercy, sent in respectful,
to the lawmakers of the land.
And he said the men jeered at it, and throwed it round the room, and
called it all to nort, and made the meanest speeches about it you ever
heard, talked nasty, and finally threw it under the table, and acted
so haughty and overbearinâ€™ towards it, that Bub said he was afraid to
tackle â€˜em. He said â€œhe knew they would throw Dorleskyâ€™s errents under
NA
afraid--(he owned it up to me)--he was afraid they would knock him down.
So he backed out with Dorleskyâ€™s errents, and never give it to â€˜em at
all.

into ridicule, throwed â€˜em round under their feet, they wouldnâ€™t pay

And I was ashamed enough as I looked Noah Websterâ€™s steel engraving in
the face, to think I had misspoke myself, and called â€˜em gentlemen.
[Illustration: HOW WOMANâ€™S PRAYERS ARE ANSWERED.]
Wall, from that minute I gin up doinâ€™ Dorleskyâ€™s errents. And I felt
like death about it. But this thought held me up,--that I had done my
best. But I didnâ€™t feel like doinâ€™ another thing all the rest of that
day, only jest feel disapinted and grieved over my bad luck with the
errents. I always think it is best, if you can possibly arrainge it in
that way, to give up one day, or half a day, to feelinâ€™ bad over any
perticuler disapintment, or to worry about any thing, and do all your
worryinâ€™ up in that time, and then give it up for good, and go to
feelinâ€™ happy agin. It is also best, if you have had a hull lot of
things to get mad about, to set apart half a day, when you can spare the
time, and do up all your resentinâ€™ in that time. It is easier, and takes
less time than to keep resentinâ€™ â€˜em as they take place; and you can
feel clever quicker than in the common way.
Wall, I felt dretful bad for Dorlesky and the hull wimmen race of the
land, and for the men too. And I kepâ€™ up my bad feelinâ€™s till pretty
nigh dusk. But as I see the sun go down, and the sky grow dark, I
says,--
â€œYou are goinâ€™ down now, but you are a cominâ€™ up agin. As sure as the
Lord lives, the sun will shine agin; and He who holds you in His hand,
holds the destinies of the nations. He will watch over you, and me and

So I begun to feel real well agin--a little after dusk.
CHAPTER VIII.
The next morning Cicely wuznâ€™t able to leave her room,--no sick
seeminâ€™ly, but fagged out. She was a delicate little creeter always, and
seemed to grow delicater every day.
So Miss Smith went with me, and she and I sallied out alone: her name
beinâ€™ Sally, too, made it seem more singuler and coincidinâ€™.
She asked me if I didnâ€™t want to go to the Patent Office.
NA
Josiah had charged me expresly to go there, and get him a patent pail.
He needed a new milk-pail, and thought I could get it cheaper right on
the spot.
And she said that Josiah couldnâ€™t buy his pail there. But she told me
what sights and sights of things there wus to be seen there; and I found
out when I got there, that she hadnâ€™t told me the 1/2 or the 1/4 of the
sights I see.
Why, I could pass a month there in perfect destraction and happiness,
the sights are so numerous, and exceedingly destractinâ€™ and curious.
But I told Sally Smith plainly, that I wasnâ€™t half so much interested in
apple-parers and snow-plows, and the first sewinâ€™-machine and the last
one, and steam-engines and hair-pins and pianos and thimbles, and the
acres and acres of glass cases containing every thing that wus ever
heard of, and every thing that never wus heard of by anybody, and
etcetery, etcetery, and so 4th, and so 4th. And you might string them
words out over choirs and choirs of paper, and not get half an idee of
what is to be seen there.
But I told her I didnâ€™t feel half so interested in them things as I did
in the copyright. I told Sally plain â€œthat I wanted to see the place
where the copyrights on books was made. And I wanted to see the man who

NA
And I told her â€œthe law was so curious, that I believed it would be the
curiousest place, and he would be the curiousest lookinâ€™ creeter, that

But it wuznâ€™t. He looked jest like any man. And he had a sort of a

believe a word of it. I believe it was the man himself, who made the
law; for, as in all other emergincies of life, I follered Duty, and

And he as good as promised me he would.
I talked deep to him about it, but short. I told him Josiah had bought
a mair, and he expected to own it till he or the mair died. He didnâ€™t
expect to give up his right to it, and let the mair canter off free at a
stated time.
[Illustration: SAMANTHA AND SALLY IN THE PATENT OFFICE.]
NA
And I told him that â€œJosiahâ€™s farm run along one side of a pond; and if
one of his sheep got over on the other side, it was sheep jest the same,
and it was hisen jest the same: he didnâ€™t lose the right to it, because

thinkinâ€™ mebby if I made myself agreable and entertaininâ€™, he
would change the law quicker, I made a effort, and related a little
interestinâ€™ incident that I had seen take place jest before my former
departure from Jonesville, on a tower.
â€œNo, selfishness donâ€™t pay. I have seen it tried, and I know. Now,
Bildad Henzy married a wife on a speculation. She was a one-legged
woman. He was attached at the time to a woman with the usual number
of feet; but he was so close a calculator, that he thought it would be
money in his pocket to marry this one, for he wouldnâ€™t have to buy but
one shoe and stockinâ€™. But she had to jump round on that one foot,
and step heavy; so she wore out more shoes than she would if she was
NA
NA
NA
me he would change the law.
I hope he will. It makes me feel so strange every time I think out, as
strange as strange can be.
Why, I told Sally after we went out, and I spoke about â€œthe man lookinâ€™
NA
NA
And says I agin, â€œIt beats all, how anybody in human shape can make such
NA
NA
understand a thing about it; and I knew it would make me so sort oâ€™
light-headed and vacant if I went to explain it to her, that I never
said a word, and fell in at once with her proposal that we should go
and see the Treasury, and the Corcoran Art Gallery, and the Smithsonian
Institute, one at a time.
And I found the Treasury wuz a sight to behold. Such sights and sights
of money they are makinâ€™ there, and a countinâ€™. Why, I sâ€™pose they make
more money there in a week, than Josiah and I spend in a year.
I sâ€™pose most probable they made it a little faster, and more of it, on
account of my beinâ€™ there. But they have sights and sights of it. They
are dretful well off.
I asked Sally, and I spoke out kinder loud too,--I hainâ€™t one of the
underhanded kind,--I asked her, â€œIf she sâ€™posed theyâ€™d let us take hold
and make a little money for ourselves, they seemed to be so runninâ€™ over
NA
NA
NA
She kinder whispered back in a skairt way, sunthinâ€™ about â€œspeculators
NA
But I answered right out loud,--I hainâ€™t one to go whisperinâ€™
round,--and says I,--
â€œIâ€™ll bet if Uncle Sam himself was here, and knew the feelinâ€™s I had
for him, heâ€™d hand out a few dollars of his own accord for me to get
sunthinâ€™ to remember him by. Howsumever, I donâ€™t need nor want any
of his money. I hainâ€™t beholden to him nor any man. I have got over
NA
But it was a sight to behold, to see â€˜em make it.
And then, as we stood out on the sidewalk agin, the Smithsonian
Institute passed through my mind; and then the Corcoran Art Gallery
passed through it, and several other big, noble buildinâ€™s. But I let â€˜em
pass; and I says to Sally,--
NA
NA
And she said she didnâ€™t know who it wuz.
But I think it was the lamb that she had in a bakinâ€™, that drew her back
towards home. She owned up that her hired girl didnâ€™t baste it enough.
And she seemed oneasy.
NA
And then Sally give in. And she found him easy enough. She knew all the
time, it was the sheep that hampered her.
And, oh! I sâ€™pose it was a sight to be remembered, to see my talk
to that man. I sâ€™pose, if it had been printed, it would have made a
beautiful track--and lengthy.
Why, he looked fairly exhausted and cross before I got half through, I
talked so smart (eloquence is tuckerinâ€™).
I told him how our public schools was the hope of the nation. How they
neutralized to a certain extent the other schools the nation allowed to
the public,--the grog-shops, and other licensed places of ruin. I told
him how pretty it looked to me to see Civilization a marchinâ€™ along from
the Atlantic towards the Pacific, with a spellinâ€™-book in one hand, and
in the other the rosy, which she was a plantinâ€™ in place of the briars
and brambles.
And I told him how highly I approved of compulsory education.
NA
to be drawed out of the water, you jest jump in, and yank â€˜em out. And
when you see poor little ones, a sinkinâ€™ down in the deep waters of
ignorance and brutality, why, jest let Uncle Sam reach right down, and
NA
such long arms for, and long legs too,--so he can wade in if the water
NA
And says I, â€œIn the case of the little Indian, and other colored
children, heâ€™ll need the legs of a stork, the water is so deep round
â€˜em. But heâ€™ll reach â€˜em, Uncle Sam will. Heâ€™ll lift â€˜em right up in his
long arms, and set â€˜em safe on the pleasant shore. Youâ€™ll see that he
NA
Says I, â€œHow much it wus like him, to pass that law for children to be
NA
very law Christianity has took a longer stride than she could take by
NA
Why, I sâ€™pose I talked perfectly beautiful to that man: I sâ€™pose so.
And if he hadnâ€™t had a sudden engagement to go out, I should have talked
longer. But I see his engagement wus a wearinâ€™ on him. His eyes looked
fairly wild. I only give a bald idee of what I said. I have only give
the heads of my discussion to him, jest the bald heads.
Wall, after we left there, I told Sally I felt as if I must go and see
the Peace Commission. I felt as if I must make some arrangements with
â€˜em to not have any more wars. As I told Sally, â€œWe might jest as well
call ourselves Injuns and savages at once, if we had to keep up this
NA
NA
for fashion, or dry-goods; though I sâ€™pose lots of both of â€˜em are to
NA
levys as I sâ€™pose they call â€˜em here. I may go to â€˜em ruther than hurt
the feelinâ€™s of the upper 10. I want to do right: I donâ€™t want to hurt
the feelinâ€™s of them 10. They have hearts, and they are sensitive.
I donâ€™t think I have ever took to them 10, as much as I have to some
others; but I wish â€˜em well.
â€œAnd I sâ€™pose you see as grand and curious people to their parties here,
as you can see together in any other place on the globe.
â€œI sâ€™pose it is a sight to behold, to see â€˜em together. To see them, as
the poet says, â€˜To the manner born,â€™ and them that wasnâ€™t born in
the same manor, but tryinâ€™ to act as if they was. Wealth and display,
natural courtesy and refinement, walkinâ€™ side by side with pretentius
vulgarity, and mebby poverty bringinâ€™ up the rear. Genius and folly,
honesty and affectation, gentleness and sweetness, and brazen impudence,
and hatred and malice, and envy and uncharitableness. All languages and
peoples under the sun, and differing more than stars ever did, one from
another.
[Illustration: SAMANTHA AT THE PRESIDENTâ€™S RECEPTION.]
â€œAnd what makes it more curious and mysterius is, the way they dress,
some on â€˜em. Why, they say--it has come right straight to me by them
that know--that the ladies wear what they call full dress; and the
strange and mysterius part of it is, that the fuller the dress is, the
less they have on â€˜em.
â€œThis is a deep subject, and queer; and I donâ€™t sâ€™pose you will take my
word for it, and I donâ€™t want you to. But I have been _told_ so.
â€œWhy, I sâ€™pose them upper 10 have their hands full, their 20 hands
completely full. I fairly pity â€˜em--the hull 10 of â€˜em. They want me,
and they need me, I sâ€™pose, and I must tend to some of â€˜em.
NA
store-clothes. I did want to get me a new calico dress,--London brown
with a set flower on it. But I can do without that dress, and the upper
NA
I felt as if I must tend to it: I fairly hankered to do away with war,
immejiately and to once. But I knew right was right, and I felt
that Sally ort to be let to tend to her lamb; so Sally and I sallied
homewards.
But the hired girl had tended to it well. It wus good--very good.
CHAPTER IX.
Wall, the next morninâ€™ Cicely wus better, and we sot sail for Mount
Vernon. It was about ten oâ€™clock A.M. when I, accompanied by Cicely and
the boy, sot sail from Washington, D.C., to perform about the ostensible
reason of my tower,--to weep on the tomb of the noble G. Washington.
My intentions had been and wuz, to weep for him on my tower. I had come
prepared. 2 linen handkerchiefs and a large cotton one reposed in the
pocket of my polenay, and I had on my new waterproof. I never do things
by the 1/2s.
It was a beautiful seen, as we floated down the still river, to look
back and see the Capitol risinâ€™ white and fair like a dream, the
glitterinâ€™ snow of the monument, and the green heights, all bathed in
the glory of that perfect May morninâ€™. It wuz a fair seen.
Happy groups of people sot on the peaceful decks,--stately gentlemen,
handsome ladies, and pretty children. And in one corner, off kinder by
themselves, sot that band of dusky singers, whose songs have delighted
the world. Modest, good-lookinâ€™ dark girls, manly, honest-lookinâ€™ dark
boys.
Only a few short years ago this black people was drove about like dumb
cattle,--bought and sold, hunted by blood-hounds; the wimmen hunted to
infamy and ruin, the men to torture and to death. The wimmen denied the
first right of womanhood, to keep themselves pure. The men denied the
first right of manhood, to protect the ones they loved. Deprived legally
of purity and honor, and all the rights of commonest humanity--worn with
unpaid toil, beaten, whipped, tortured, dispised and rejected of men.
[Illustration: GOING TO MOUNT VERNON.]
Now, a few short years have passed over this dark race, and these
children of slaves that I looked upon have been guests of the proudest
and noblest in this and in foreign lands. Hands that hold the destinies
of mighty empires have clasped theirs in frankest friendship, and
crowned heads have bowed low before â€˜em to hide the tears their sweet
voices have called forth. What feelinâ€™s I felt as I looked on â€˜em! and
my soul burned inside of me, almost to the extent of settinâ€™ my polenay
on fire, a thinkinâ€™ of all this.
And pretty soon, right when I was a reveryinâ€™--right there, when we wuz
a floatinâ€™ clown the still waters, their voices riz up in one of their
NA
NA
And I declare forâ€™t, as I listened to â€˜em, there wuznâ€™t a dry eye in my
head; and I wet every one of them 3 handkerchiefs that I had calculated
to mourn for G. Washington on, wet as sop. But I didnâ€™t care. I knew
that George had rather not be mourned for on dry handkerchiefs, than
that I should stent myself in emotions in such a time as this. He loved
Liberty himself, and fit for it. And anyway, I didnâ€™t sense what I was
a doinâ€™, not a mite. I took out them handkerchiefs entirely unbeknown to
me, and put â€˜em back unbeknown.
The words of them songs hainâ€™t got hardly any sense, as we earthly
beinâ€™s count sense; there are scores of great singers, whose trained
voices are a hundred-fold more melodious: but these simple strains move
us, thrill us; they jest get right inside of our hearts and souls, and
take full possession of us.
It seems as if nothinâ€™ human of so little importance could so move us.
Is it Godâ€™s voice that speaks to us through them? Is it His Spirit that
lifts us up, sways us to and fro, that blows upon us, as we listen to
their voices? The Spirit that come down to cheer them broken hearts,
lift them up in their captivity, does it now sway and melt the hearts
of their captors? We read of One who watches over His sorrowing, wronged
NA
Anon, or nearly at that time, a silver bell struck out a sweet sort of
a mournful note; and we jest stood right in towards the shore, and
disembarked from the bark.
We clomb the long hill, and stood on top, with powerful emotions (but
little or no breath); stood before the iron bars that guarded the tomb
of George Washington, and Martha his wife.
I looked at the marble coffin that tried to hold George, and felt
how vain it wuz to think that any tomb could hold him. That peaceful,
tree-covered hill couldnâ€™t hold his tomb. Why, it wuz lifted up in every
land that loved freedom. The hull liberty-lovinâ€™ earth wuz his tomb and
his monument.
And that great river flowinâ€™ on and on at his feet--as long as that
river rolls, George Washington shall float on it, he and his faithful
Martha. It shall bear him to the sea and the ocian, and abroad to every
land.
Oh! what feelinâ€™s I felt as I stood there a reveryinâ€™, my body still,
but my mind proudly soarinâ€™! To think, he wuz our Washington, and that
time couldnâ€™t kill him. For he shall walk through the long centuries to
come. He shall bear to the high chamber of prince and ruler, memories
that shall blossom into deeds, awaken souls, rouse powers that shall
never die, that shall scatter blessings over lands afar, strike the
fetters from slave and serf.
The hands they folded over his peaceful breast so many years ago, are
not lying there in that marble coffin: the calm blue eyes closed so many
years ago, are still lookinâ€™ into souls. Those hands lift the low walls
of the poor boyâ€™s chamber, as he reads of victory over tyranny, of
conquerinâ€™ discouragement and defeat.
[Illustration: BEFORE THE TOMB OF WASHINGTON.]
The low walls fade away; the dusky rafters part to admit the infinite,
infinite longinâ€™s to do and dare, infinite resolves to emulate those
deeds of valor and heroism. How the calm blue eyes look down into the
boyâ€™s impassioned soul, how the shadowy hands beckon him upward, up the
rocky heights of noble endeavor, noble deeds! How the inspiration of
this life, these deeds of might and valor, nerve the young heart for
future strivings for freedom and justice and truth!
Is it not a blessed thing to thus live on forever in true, eager hearts,
to nerve the heroâ€™s arm, to inspire deeds of courage and daring? The
weary body may rest; but to do this, is surely not to die; no, it is
to live, to be immortal, to thus become the beating heart, the living,
struggling, daring soul of the future.
And right while I was thinkinâ€™ these thoughts, and lookinâ€™ off over the
still landscape, the peaceful waters, this band of dark singers stood
with reverent faces and uncovered heads, and begun singinâ€™ one of their
sweetest melodies,--
NA
Oh! as them inspired, hantinâ€™ notes rose through the soft, listeninâ€™
air, and hanted me, walked right round inside my heart and soul, and
inspired me--why! how many emotions I did have,--moreâ€™n 85 a minute
right along!
As I thought of how many times since the asscension of our Lord, tombs
have opened, and the dead come forth alive; how Faith and Justice will
triumph in the end; how you canâ€™t bury â€˜em deep enough, or roll a stun
big enough and hard enough before the door, but what, in some calm
morninâ€™, the earliest watcher shall see a tall, fair angel standinâ€™
where the dead has lain, bearinâ€™ the message of the risen Lord, â€œHe rose
NA
I thought how George W. and our other old 4 fathers thought in the long,
toilsome, weary hours before the dawninâ€™, that fair Freedom was dead;
but she rose, she rose.
I thought how the dusky race whose sweet songs was a floatinâ€™ round the
grave of him who loved freedom, and gave his life for it; I thought
how, durinâ€™ the dreary time when they was captives in a strange land,
chained, scourged, and tortured, how they thought, through this long,
long night of years, that Justice was dead, and Mercy and Pity and
Righteousness.
But there come a glorious morninâ€™ when fathers and mothers clasped their
children in their arms, their own once more, in arms that was their own,
to labor and protect, and they sung together of Freedom and Right, how
though they wuz buried deep, and the night wuz long, and the watchers
by the tomb weary, weary unto death, yet they rose, they rose from the
dead.
And then I thought of the tombs that darken our land to-day, where the
murdered, the legally murdered, lay buried. I thought of the graves more
hopeless fur than them that entomb the dead,--the graves where lay the
livinâ€™ dead. Dead souls bound to still breathinâ€™ bodies, dead hopes,
ambitions, dead dreams of usefulness and respectability, happiness, dead
purity, faith, honor, dead, all dead, all bound to the still breathinâ€™
body, by the festerinâ€™, putrid death-robes of helplessness and despair.
There they lie chained to their dark tombs by links slight at first,
but twisted by the hard old fingers of blind habit, to chains of iron,
chains linked about, and eatinâ€™ into, not only the quiverinâ€™ flesh, but
the frenzied brains, the hope less hearts, the ruined souls.
Heavy, hopeless-lookinâ€™ vaults they are indeed, whose air is putrid with
the sickeninâ€™ miasma of moral loathsomness and deseese; whose walls are
painted with hideous pictures of murder, rapine, lust, starvation, woe,
and despair, earthly and eternal ruin. Shapes of the dreadful past, the
hopeless future, that these livinâ€™ dead stare upon with broodinâ€™ frenzy
by night and by day.
Oh the tombs, the countless, countless tombs, where lie these breathinâ€™
corpses! How mothers weep over them! how wives kneel, and beat their
hearts out on the rocky barriers that separate them from their heartsâ€™
love, their heartsâ€™ desire! How little starvinâ€™, naked children cower in
their ghostly shadows through dark midnights! How fathers weep for their
children, dead to them, dead to honor, to shame, to humanity! How the
cries of the mourners ascend to the sweet heavens!
And less peaceful than the graves of the departed, these tombs
themselves are full of the hopeless cries of the entombed, praying for
help, praying for some strong hand to reach down and lift them out of
their reeking, polluted, living death.
The whole of our fair land is covered with jest such graves: its turf is
tread down by the footprints of the mourners who go about the streets.
They pray, they weep: the night is long, is long. But the morning will
dawn at last.
And the women,--daughters, wives, mothers,--who kneel with clasped
hands beside the tombs, heaviest-eyed, deepest mourners, because most
helpless. Lift up your heavy eyes: the sun is even now rising, that
shall gild the sky at last. The morninâ€™ light is even now dawninâ€™ in the
east. It shall fall first upon your uplifted brows, your prayerful eyes.
Most blessed of God, because you loved most, sorrowed most. To you shall
it be given to behold first the tall, fair angel of Resurection and
Redemption, standinâ€™ at the graveâ€™s mouth. Into your hands shall be put
the key to unlock the heavy doors, where your loved has lain.
The dead shall rise. Temperance and Justice and Liberty shall rise.
They shall go forth to bless our fair land. And purified and enobled,
it shall be the best beloved, the fairest land of God beneath the sun.
Refuge of the oppressed and tempted, inspiration of the hopeless, light
of the world.
And free mothers shall clasp their free children to their hearts; and
fathers and mothers and children shall join in one heavenly strain, song
of freedom and of truth. And the nations shall listen to hear how â€œthey
NA
As the tones of the sweet hymn died on the soft air, and the blessed
vision passed with it; when I come down onto my feet,--for truly, I had
been lifted up, and by the side of myself,--Cicely was standinâ€™ with her
brown eyes lookinâ€™ over the waters, holdinâ€™ the hand of the boy; and I
see every thing that the song did or could mean, in the depths of her
deep, prophetic eyes. Sad eyes, too, they was, and discouraged; for the
morning wus fur away--and--and the boy wus pullinâ€™ at her hand, eager to
get away from where he wus.
The boy led us; and we follered him up the gradual hill to the old
homestead of Washington, Mount Vernon.
Lookinâ€™ down from the broad, high porch, you can look directly down
through the trees into the river. The water calm and sort oâ€™ golden,
through the green of the trees, and every thing looked peaceful and
serene.
There are lots of interestinâ€™ things to be seen here,--the tombs of the
rest of the Washington family; the key of the Bastile, covered with the
blood and misery of a foreign land; the tree that carries us back in
memory to his grave, where he rests quietly, who disturbed the sleep of
empires and kingdoms; the furniture of Washington and his family,--the
chairs they sot in, the tables they sot at, and the rooms where
they sot; the harpiscord, that Nelly Custis and Mrs. G. Washington
harpiscorded on.
But she whose name wus once Smith longed to see somethinâ€™ else fur more.
What wus it?
It wus not the great drawinâ€™-rooms, the guest-chambers, the halls, the
grounds, the live-stock, nor the pictures, nor the flowers.
No: it wus the old garret of the mansion, the low old garret, where she
sot, our Lady Washington, in her widowed dignity, with no other fire
only the light of deathless love that lights palace or hovel,--sot there
in the window, because she could look out from it upon the tomb of her
mighty dead.
Sot lookinâ€™ out upon the river that wus sweepinâ€™ along under sun and
moon, bearing on every wave and ripple the glory and beauty of his name.
Bearing it away from her mebby, she would sometimes sadly think, as she
thought of happy days gone by; for though souls may soar, hearts will
cling. And sometimes storms would vex the riverâ€™s unquiet breast; and
mebby the waves would whisper to her lovinâ€™ heart, â€œNever more, never

[Illustration: THE OLD HOME OF WASHINGTON.]
As she sot there looking out, waiting for that other river, whose waves
crept nearer and nearer to her feet,--that other river, on which her
soul should sail away to meet her glorious dead; that river which

whose waves are murmuring of nothing less beautiful than of meeting, of
love, and of lasting repose.
CHAPTER X.
When we got back from Mount Vernon, and entered our boardinâ€™-house,
Cicely went right up to her room. But I, feelinâ€™ kinder beat out
(eloquent emotions are very tuckerinâ€™ on a tower), thought I would set
down a few minutes in the parlor to rest, before I mounted up the stairs
to my room.
But truly, as it turned out, I had better have gone right up, breath or
no breath.
For, while I was a settinâ€™ there, a tall, sepulchral lookinâ€™ female,
that I had noticed at the breakfast-table, come up to me; and says
she,--
â€œI beg your pardon, mom, but I believe you are the noble and eloquent

Says I calmly, â€œI hainâ€™t a stoppinâ€™--I am stopped, as it were, for a few
NA
NA
No. 17, to give a private seansy. And knowinâ€™ you are a great case to
investigate into truths, I thought mebby you would love to come, and

I thanked her for her kindness, but told her â€œI guessed I wouldnâ€™t go. I

Thomas J. up when he was little, and naughty; and he would, in spite of

and appear to us. But he didnâ€™t seem to think the conditions wus so
favorable, and he didnâ€™t seem to appear so much, after his father
NA
NA
And after I had said it, the idee struck me as beinâ€™ sort oâ€™
pitiful,--to go to whippinâ€™ a ghost. But she didnâ€™t seem to notice my
remark, for she seemed to be a gazinâ€™ upward in a sort of a muse; and
she says,--
NA
NA
â€œCome to-night to our seansy, and we will call â€˜em, and you shall talk
NA
NA
Iâ€™ll tell you, I have got to mend my petticoat to-night. My errents have
took me round to such a extent, that it has got all frayed out round the
bottom, and I have got to mend the fray. But, if any of my kindred are
there, you jest mention it to â€˜em that she that wuz Samantha Smith is
stopped at No. 16, and, if perfectly convenient, would love to see
NA
NA
[Illustration: THOMAS JEFFERSON S GHOST.]
Says she, â€œYou are makinâ€™ fun: you donâ€™t believe they will be there, do
NA
â€œWall, to be honest with you, it looks dubersome to me. It does seem to
me, that if my father or mother sot out from the other world, and come
down to this boardinâ€™-house, to No. 17, they would know, without havinâ€™
to be told, that I was in the next room to â€˜em; and they wouldnâ€™t want
to stay with a passel of indifferent strangers, when their own child was
NA
NA
she.
â€œWall, to tell you the plain truth, I donâ€™t seem to believe â€˜em to any
great extent. I believe, if God wants to speak to a human soul below,
He can, without any of your performances and foolishness; and when I say
performences and when I say foolishness, I say â€˜em in very polite ways:
and I donâ€™t want to hurt anybodyâ€™s feelinâ€™s by sayinâ€™ things hainâ€™t so,
NA
â€œDonâ€™t you believe in the communion of saints? Donâ€™t you believe God
NA
â€œYes, I do! I believe that now, as in the past, the pure in heart shall

And I thought of Cicely, and couldnâ€™t help it.
â€œI believe there are pure souls, especially when they are near to the
other world, who can look in, and behold its beauty. Why, it hainâ€™t but
a little ways from here,--it canâ€™t be, sense a breath of air will blow
us into it. It takes sights of preparation to get ready to go, but it is
only a short sail there. And you may go all over the land from house
to house, and you will hear in almost every one of some dear friend who
died with their faces lit up with the glow of the light shininâ€™ from
some one of the many mansions,--the dear home-light of the fatherland;
died speakinâ€™ to some loved one, gone before. But I donâ€™t believe you
can coax that light, and them voices, down into a cabinet, and let â€˜em

NA
NA
mind. I donâ€™t say there hainâ€™t no truth in it, because I donâ€™t know;
and that is one of the best reasons in the world for not sayinâ€™ a thing
hainâ€™t so. When you think how big a country the land of Truth is, and
how many great unexplored regions lay in it, why should Josiah Allenâ€™s
wife stand and lean up aginst a tree on the outmost edge of the
frontier, and say what duz and what duznâ€™t lay hid in them mysterius and
beautiful regions that happier eyes than hern shall yet look into?
â€œNo: the great future is the fulfillment of the prophecies, and blind
gropinâ€™s of the present; and it is not for me, nor Josiah, nor anybody
else, to talk too positive about what we hainâ€™t seen, and donâ€™t know.
â€œNo: nor I hainâ€™t one to say it is the Devilâ€™s work, not claiminâ€™ such a
close acquaintance with the gentleman named, as some do, who profess
to know all his little social eccentricities. But I simply say, and say
honest, that I hainâ€™t felt no drawinâ€™s towards seancys, nor felt like
follerinâ€™ â€˜em up. But I am perfectly willinâ€™ you should have your own
NA
NA
â€œYes, mom, I do. But I never heard of a angel beinâ€™ stanchelled up in a
box-stall, and let out of it agin at stated times, like a yearlinâ€™ colt.
(Excuse my metafor, mom, I am country bred and born.) And no angel that
I ever heard on, has been harnessed and tackled up with any ropes or
strings whatsoever. No! whenever we hear of angels appearinâ€™ to men,
they have flown down, white-winged and radiant, right out of the
heavens, which is their home, and appeared to men, entirely unbeknown
to them. That is the way they appeared to the shephards at Bethlahem, to

NA
â€œI donâ€™t say they couldnâ€™t. There is no place in the Bible, that I know
of, where it says they shall never appear agin to man. But I sâ€™pose, in
the days I speak of, when the One Pure Heart was upon earth, Earth and
Heaven drew nearer together, as it were,--the divine and the human. And

 says I dreamily (forgettinâ€™ the mejum, and other trials), â€œwho knows but
what we might, in some fair day, look up into the still heavens, and see
through the clear blue, in the distance, a glimpse of the beautiful city
of the redeemed?

NA
â€œWhy not believe, with us, voices from Heaven speak through these

â€œBecause it looks dubersome to me--dretful dubersome. It donâ€™t look
reasonable to me, that He, the mighty King of heaven and earth, would
speak to His children through a senseless Indian jargon, or impossible

NA
â€œI tell you, I donâ€™t know but He duz. But I donâ€™t believe it is in that
manner. Way back to the creation, when we read of Godâ€™s speakinâ€™ to man,
the voice come directly down from heaven to their souls.
â€œIn the hush of the twilight, when every thing was still and peaceful,
and Adam was alone, then he heard Godâ€™s voice. He didnâ€™t have to wait
for favorable conditions, or set round a table; for, what is more
convincinâ€™, I donâ€™t believe he had a table to set round.
â€œIn the dreary lonesomeness of the great desert, God spoke to the
heart-broken Hagar. She didnâ€™t have to try any tests to call down the
spirits. Clear and sudden out of heaven come the Lordâ€™s voice speaking
to her soul in comfort and in prophecy, and her eyes was opened, and she
saw waters flowinâ€™ in the midst of the desert.
â€œUp on the mountain top, Godâ€™s voice spoke to Abraham; and Lot in the
quiet of evening, at the tentâ€™s door, received the angelic visitants.
Sudden, unbeknown to them, they come. They didnâ€™t have to put nobody
into a trance, nor holler, so we read.
â€œIn the hush of the temple, through the quiet of her motherly dreams,
Hannah heard a voice. Hannah didnâ€™t have to say, â€˜If you are a spirit,
rap so many times.â€™ No: she knew the voice. God prepares the listeninâ€™
soul His own self. â€˜They know my voice,â€™ so the Lord said.
â€œDaniel and the lions didnâ€™t have to â€˜form a circleâ€™ for him to see
the one in shininâ€™ raiment. No: the angel guest came down from heaven
unbidden, and appeared to Daniel alone, in peril; and as he stood by
the â€˜great river,â€™ it said, â€˜Be strong, be strong!â€™ preparinâ€™ him for
conflict. And Daniel was strengthened, so the Bible says.
â€œGodâ€™s hand is not weaker to-day, and His conflicts are beinâ€™ waged on
many a battle-field. And I dare not say that He does not send His angels
to comfort and sustain them who from love to Him go out into rightous
warfare. But I donâ€™t believe they come through a seansy. I donâ€™t,
honestly. I donâ€™t believe Daniel would have felt strengthened a mite, by
seeinâ€™ a materialized rag-baby hung out by a wire in front of a hemlock
box, and then drawed back sudden.
[Illustration: HEAVENLY VISITORS.]
â€œNo: Adam and Enoch, and Mary and Paul and St. John, didnâ€™t have to say,
before they saw the heavenly guests, â€˜If you are a spirit, manifest it
by liftinâ€™ up some table-legs.â€™ And they didnâ€™t have to tie a mejum into
a box before they could hear Godâ€™s voice. No: we read in the Bible of
eight different ones who come back from death, and appeared to their
friends, besides the many who came forth from their graves at Jerusalem.
But they didnâ€™t none of â€˜em come in this way from round under tables,
and out of little coops, and etcetery.
â€œAnd as it was in the old days, so I believe it is to-day. I believe, if
God wants to speak to a human soul, livinâ€™ or dead, He donâ€™t _need_ the
help of ropes and boxes and things. It donâ€™t look reasonable to think He
_has_ to employ such means. And it donâ€™t look reasonable to me to think,
if He wants to speak to one of His children in comfort or consolation,
He will try to drive a hard bargain with â€˜em, and make â€˜em pay from
fifty cents to a dollar to hear Him, children half price. Howsomever,

She tosted her head in a high-headed way, which is gaulinâ€™ in the
extreme to see in another female. And she says,--

I sâ€™pose she thought that would scare me, but it didnâ€™t. I says,--
â€œI believe in takinâ€™ truth direct from Godâ€™s own hand and revelation.
But I donâ€™t have any faith in modern spiritual seansys. They seem to

But, if youâ€™ll believe it, for all the pains I took to be almost

Good land! what strange creeters there are in the world, anyway!
Wall, I had fairly forgot that the boy wus in the room. But 1,000 and 5
is a small estimate of the questions he asked me after she went out.
â€œWhat a seansy was? And did folks appear there? And would his papa
appear if he should tie himself up in a box? And if I would be sorry if
his papa didnâ€™t appear, if he didnâ€™t appear? And where the folks went
to that I said, come out of their graves? And did they die again? Or did
they keep on a livinâ€™ and a livinâ€™ and a livinâ€™? And if I wished I could

Good land! it made me feel wild as a loon, and Cicely put the boy to

But I happened to go into the bedroom for something; and he opened his
eyes, and says he,--

and died before their paâ€™s come out, would they come out too? and would

But I went out immegiatly, and sâ€™pose he went to sleep.
Wall, the next morninâ€™ I got up feelinâ€™ kinder mauger. I felt sort
oâ€™ weary in my mind as well as my body. For I had kepâ€™ up a powerful
ammount of thinkinâ€™ and medetatinâ€™. Mebby right when I would be a
talkinâ€™ and a smilinâ€™ to folks about the weather or literatoor or any
thing, my mind would be hard at work on problems, and I would be a
takinâ€™ silent observations, and musinâ€™ on what my eyes beheld.
NA
And I had felt more and more satisfied of the wisdom of the conclusion
I reached on my first interview with Allen Arthur,--that I dast not, I
dast not let my companion go from me into Washington.
No! I felt that I dast not, as his mind was, let him go into temptation.
I felt that he wanted to make money out of the Government I loved; and
after I had looked round me, and observed persons and things, I felt
that he would do it.
I felt that _I_ dast not let him go.
I knew that he wanted to help them that helped him, without no deep
thought as to the special fitness of uncle Nate Gowdy and Ury Henzy for
governmental positions. And after I had enquired round a little, and
considered the heft of his mind, and the weight of example, I felt he
would do it.
And I _dast_ not let him go.
And, though I knew his hand was middlinâ€™ free now, still I realized that
other hands just as free once had had rings slipped into â€˜em, and was
led by â€˜em whithersoever the ring-makers wished to lead them.
I dast _not_ let him go.
I knew that now his morals, though small (he donâ€™t weigh moreâ€™n a
hundred,--bones, moral sentiments, and all), was pretty sound and firm,
the most of the time. But the powerful winds that blew through them
broad streets of Washington from every side, and from the outside, and
from the under side, powerful breezes, some cold, and some powerful hot
ones--why, I felt that them small morals, more than as likely as not,
would be upsot, and blowed down, and tore all to pieces.
I dast not _let_ him go.
I knew he was willinâ€™ to buy votes. If willinâ€™ to buy,--the fearful
thought hanted me,--mebby he would be willinâ€™ to sell; and, the more I
looked round and observed, the more I felt that he would.
I felt that I dast not let _him_ go.
No, no! I dast not let him _go_.
I was a musinâ€™ on this thought at the breakfast-table where I sot with
Cicely, the boy not beinâ€™ up. I was settinâ€™ to the table as calm and
cool as my toast (which was _very_ cool), when the hired man brought me
a letter; and I opened it right there, for I see by the post-mark it
was from my Josiah. And I read as follers, in dismay and anguish, for I
thought he was crazy:--
MI DEER WYF,--Kum hum, I hav got a crik in mi bak. Kum hum, mi deer Sam,

I dropt my knife and fork (I had got about through eatinâ€™, anyway), and
hastened to my room. Cicely followed me, anxious-eyed, for I looked bad.
I dropped into a chair; and almost buryinâ€™ my face in my white linen
handkerchief, I give vent to some moans of anguish, and a large number
of sithes. And Cicely says,--

And I says,--

[Illustration: SAMANTHAâ€™S SORROW.]

as I did so,--
â€œHe has had too much strain on his mind, for the size of it. His plans
have been too deep. He has grappled with too many public questions.
I ortnâ€™t to have left him alone with politics. But I left him for his
good. But never, never, will I leave that beloved man agin, crazy, or no
crazy, creek, or no creek.

I wept some. But I thought that mebby he would know my cream biscuit and
other vittles, I felt that he would re_cog_nise them.
But by this time Cicely had got the letter read through; and she said
NA
she had seen it; and so I brightened up, and felt well: though, as I
told her,--
NA

NA
NA
Cicely didnâ€™t feel as if she could go the next day, for there was to be
a great meetinâ€™ of the friends of temperance, in a few days, there; and
she wanted to attend to it; she wanted to help all she could; and then,
there wus a person high in influence that she wanted to converse with
on the subject. That good little thing was willinâ€™ to do _any thing_ for
the sake of the boy and the Right.
But I says to her, â€œI _must_ go, for that word â€˜planâ€™ worrys me; it
worrys me far more than the creek: and I see my partner is all unstrung,
NA
So it wus decided, that I should start in the morning, and Cicely come
on in a few days: she was all boyed up with the thought that at this
meetinâ€™ she could get some help and hope for the boy.
But, after Cicely went to bed, I sot there, and got to thinkinâ€™ about
the new spellinâ€™, and felt that I approved of it. My mind is such that
_instantly_ I can weigh and decide.
I took some of these words, photograph, philosophy, etc., in one hand,
and in the other I took filosify and fotograf; and as I hefted â€˜em, I
see the latter was easier to carry. I see they would make our language
easier to learn by children and foreigners; it would lop off a lot
of silent letters of no earthly use; it would make far less labor in
writinâ€™, in printinâ€™, in cost of type, and would be better every way.
Cicely said a good many was opposed to it on account of beinâ€™ attached
to the old way. But I donâ€™t feel so, though I love the old things with a
love that makes my heart ache sometimes when changes come. But my reason
tells me that it hainâ€™t best to be attached to the old way if the new is
better.
Now, I sâ€™pose our old 4 fathers was attached to the idee of hitchinâ€™ an
ox onto a wagon, and ridinâ€™ after it. And our old 4 mothers liked the
idee of beinâ€™ perched up on a pillion behind the old 4 fathers. I sâ€™pose
they hated the idee of gettinâ€™ off of that pillion, and onhitchinâ€™ that
ox. But they had to, they had to get down, and get up into phaetons and
railway cars, and steamboats.
And I sâ€™pose them old 4 people (likely creeters they wuz too) hated the
idee of usinâ€™ matches; used to love to strike fire with a flint, and
trample off a mild to a neighberâ€™s on January morninâ€™s (and their
morninâ€™s was _very_ early) to borrow some coals if they had lost their
flint. I sâ€™pose they had got attached to that flint, some of â€˜em, and
hated to give it up, thought it would be lonesome. But they had to; and
the flint didnâ€™t care, it knew matches was better. The calm, everlasting
forces of Nature donâ€™t murmur or rebel when they are changed for newer,
greater helps. No: it is only human beinâ€™s who complain, and have the
heartache, because they are so sot.
[Illustration: OUR 4 PARENTS.]
But whether we murmur, or whether we are calm, whether we like it, or
whether we donâ€™t, we have to move our tents. We are only campinâ€™ out,
here; and we have to move our tents along, and let the new things push
us out of the way. The old things now, are the new ones of the past; and
what seems new to us, will soon be the old.
Why, how long does it seem, only a minute, since we was a buildinâ€™ moss
houses down in the woods back of the old schoolhouse? Beautiful, fresh
rooms, carpeted with the green moss, with bright young faces bendinâ€™
down over â€˜em. Where are they now? The dust of how many years--I donâ€™t
want to think how many--has sifted down over them velvet-carpeted
mansions, turned them into dust.
And the same dust has sprinkled down onto the happy heads of the fresh,
bright-faced little group gathered there.
[Illustration: BORROWING COALS.]
Charley, and Alice! oh! the dust is very deep on her head,--the dust
that shall at last lay over all our heads. And Louis! Bright blue eyes
there may be to-day, old Time, but none truer and tenderer than his.
But long ago, oh! long ago, the dust covered you--the dust that is older
than the pyramids, old, and yet new; for on some mysterious breeze it
was wafted to you, it drifted down, and covered the blue eyes and the
brown eyes, hid the bright faces forever.
And the years have sprinkled down into Charleyâ€™s grave business head
tiresome dust of dividends and railway shares. Kate and Janet, and Will
and Helen and Harry--where are you all to-day, I wonder? But though I do
not know that, I do know this,--that Time has not stood still with any
of you. The years have moved you along, hustled you forward, as they
swept by. You have had to move along, and let other bright faces stand
in front of you.
You are all buildinâ€™ houses to-day that you think are more endurinâ€™. But
what you build to-day--hopes built upon worldly wealth, worldly fame,
household affection, political success--ah I will they not pass
away like the green moss houses down in the woods back of the old
schoolhouse?
Yes, they, too, will pass away, so utterly that only their dust will
remain. But God grant that we may all meet, happy children again, young
with the new life of the immortals, on some happy playground of the
heavenly life!
But poor little houses of moss and cedar boughs, you are broken down
years and years ago, trampled down into dust, and the dust blown away
by the rushinâ€™ years. Blown away, but gathered up agin by careful old
Nature, nourishinâ€™ with it a newer, fresher growth.
I donâ€™t sâ€™pose any of us really hanker after growinâ€™ old; sometimes I
kinder hate to; and so I told Josiah one day.
And he says, â€œWhy, we hainâ€™t the only ones that is growinâ€™ old. Why,
everybody is as old as we be, that wuz born, at the same time; and lots
of folks are older. Why, there is uncle Nate Gowdey, and aunt Seeny:
NA
[Illustration: THE OLD SCHOOLHOUSE]
Says I, â€œThat is a great comfort to meditate on, Josiah; but it donâ€™t
NA
And he said â€œhe didnâ€™t care a dumb about it, if he didnâ€™t have to work
NA
NA
(Now, that man donâ€™t work so very hard. But donâ€™t tell him I said so:
heâ€™s real fractious on that subject, caused, I think, by rheumatiz, and
mebby the Plan.)
I told Josiah that it wouldnâ€™t make growinâ€™ old any easier to set down,
than it would to stand up.
I donâ€™t sâ€™pose it makes much difference about our bodies, anyway; they
are only wrappers for the soul: the real, person is within. But then,
you know, you get sort oâ€™ attached to your own body, yourself, you know,
if you have lived with yourself any length of time, as we have, a good
many of us.
You may not be handsome, but you sort oâ€™ like your own looks, after all.
Your eyes have a sort of a good look to you. Your hands are soft and
white; and they are your own too, which makes â€˜em nearer to you; they
have done sights for you, and you canâ€™t help likinâ€™ â€˜em. And your mouth
looks sort oâ€™ agreable and natural to you.
You donâ€™t really like to see the dimpled, soft hands change into an
older personâ€™s hands; you kinder hate to change the face for an older,
more care-worn face; you get sick of lookinâ€™-glasses.
And sometimes you feel a sort of a homesick longinâ€™ for your old
self--for the bright, eager face that looked back to you from the old
lookinâ€™-glass on summer morninâ€™s, when the winder was open out into the
orchard, and the May birds was singinâ€™ amidst the apple-blows. The red
lips parted with a happy smile; the bright, laughinâ€™ eyes, sort oâ€™ soft
too, and wistful--wishful for the good that mebby come to you, and mebby
didnâ€™t, but which the glowinâ€™ face was sure of, on that spring morning
with the May birds singinâ€™ outside, and the May birds singinâ€™ inside.
[Illustration: A MAY MORNING.]
Time may have brought you somethinâ€™ better--better than you dreamed of
on that summer morninâ€™. But it is different, anyhow; and you canâ€™t help
gettinâ€™ kinder homesick, longinâ€™, wantinâ€™ that pretty young face again,
wantinâ€™ the heart back again that went with it.
Wall, I sâ€™pose we shall have it back--sometime. I sâ€™pose we shall get
back our lost youth in the place where we first got it. And it is all
right, anyway.
We must move on. You see, Time wonâ€™t stop to argue with us, or dicker;
and our settinâ€™ down, and coaxinâ€™ him to stop a minute, and whet his
scythe, and give us a chance to get round the swath he cuts, wonâ€™t
ammount to nothinâ€™ only wastinâ€™ our breath. His scythe is one that donâ€™t
need any grindstun, and his swath is one that must be cut.
No! Time wonâ€™t lean up aginst fence corners, and wipe his brow on a
bandanna, and hang round. He jest moves right on--up and down, up and
down. On each side of us the ripe blades fall, and the flowers; and
pretty soon the swath will come right towards us, the grass-blades will
fall nearer and nearer--a turn of the gleaminâ€™ scythe, and we, too, will
be gone. The sunlight will rest on the turf where our shadows were, and
one blade of grass will be missed out of that broad harvest-field more
than we will be, when a few short years have rolled by.
The beauty and the clamor of life will go on without us. You see, we
hainâ€™t needed so much as we in our egotism think we are. The world will
get along without us, while we rest in peace.
But until then we have got to move along: we canâ€™t set down anywhere,
and set there. No: if we want to be fore mothers and fore fathers, we
mustnâ€™t set still: we must give the babies a chance to be fore mothers
and fore fathers too. It wouldnâ€™t be right to keep the babies from beinâ€™
ancestors.
We must keep a movinâ€™ on. How the summer follows the spring, and the
winter follows the autumn, and the years go by! And the clouds sail on
through the sky, and the shadows follow each other over the grass, and
the grass fadeth.
And the sun moves down the west, and the twilight follows the sun, and
at last the night comes--and then the stars shine.
Strange that all this long revery of my mind should spring from that
letter of my pardnerâ€™s. But so it is. Why, I sot probable 3 fourths of
a hour--entirely by the side of myself. Why, I shouldnâ€™t have sensed
whether I was settinâ€™ on a sofy in a Washington boarding-house (a hard
one too), or a bed of flowers in Asia Minor, or in the middle of the
Desert of Sarah. Why, I shouldnâ€™t have sensed Sarah or A. Minor at all,
if they had stood right by me, I was so lost and unbeknown to myself.
But anon, or pretty nigh that time (for I know it was ten when I got
into bed, and it probable took me 1/2 an hour to comb out my hair and
wad it up, and ondress), I rousted up out of my revery, and realized
I was Josiah Allenâ€™s wife on a tower of Principle and Discovery. I
realized I was a forerunner, and on the eve of return to the bosom of my
family (a linen bosom, with five pleats on a side).
Wall, I rose betimes in the morninâ€™, or about that time, and eat a good,
noble breakfast, soâ€™s to start feelinâ€™ well; embraced Cicely and the
boy, who asked me 32 questions while I was embracinâ€™ him. I kissed him
several times, with hugs according; and then I took leave of Sally and
Bub Smith. I paid for my board honorable, although Sally said she would
not take any pay for so short a board. But I knew, in her condition,
boards of any length should be paid for. So I insisted, and the board
was paid for. I also rewarded Bub Smith for his efforts at doinâ€™ my
errents, in a way that made his blushes melt into a glowinâ€™ background
of joyousness.
And then, havinâ€™ asked the hired man to get a covered carriage to convey
my body to the depot, and my trunk, I left Washington, D.C.
The snort of the engine as it ketched sight of me, sounded friendly to
me. It seemed to say to me,--
â€œForerunner, your runninâ€™ is done, and well done! Your labors of duty
and anxiety is over. Soon, soon will you be with your beloved pardner at
NA
Home, the dearest word that was ever said or sung.
The passengers all looked good to me. The menâ€™s hats looked like
Josiahâ€™s. They looked out of their eyes some as he did out of hisen:
they looked good to me. There was one man upbraidinâ€™ his wife about some
domestic matter, with crossness in his tone, but affectionate care and
interest in his mean. Oh, how good, and sort oâ€™ natural, he did look to
me! it almost seemed as if my Josiah was there by my side.
Never, never, does the cords of love fairly pull at your heart-strings,
a drawinâ€™ you along towards your heartâ€™s home, your heartâ€™s desire, as
when you have been off a movinâ€™ round on a tower. I longed for my dear
home, I yearned for my Josiah.
I arrove at Jonesville as night was a lettinâ€™ down her cloudy mantilly
fringed with stars (there wuznâ€™t a star: I jest put that in for oritory,
and I donâ€™t think it is wrong if I tell of it right away).
[Illustration: AT THE DEPOT.]
Evidently Josiahâ€™s creek wus better; for he wus at the depot with the
mair, to convey my body home. He wus stirred to the very depths of his
heart to see me agin; but he struggled for calmness, and told me in a
voice controlled by his firm will, to â€œhurry and get in, for the mair
NA
I, too, felt that I must emulate his calmness; and I says,--
â€œI canâ€™t get in no faster than I can. Do hold the mair still, or I canâ€™t
NA
â€œWall, wall! hainâ€™t I a holdinâ€™ it? Jump in: there is a team behind a
NA
After these little interchanges of thought and affection, there was
silence between us. Truly, there is happiness enough in beinâ€™ once more
by the side of the one you love, whether you speak or not. And, to
tell the truth, I was out of breath hurryinâ€™ so. But few words were
interchanged until the peaceful haven of home was reached.
Some few words, peaceful, calm words were uttered, as to what we
wus goinâ€™ to have for supper, and a desire on Josiahâ€™s part for a
chicken-pie and vegitables of all kinds, and various warm cakes and
pastries, compromised down to plans of tender steak, mashed potatoes,
cream biscuit, lemon custard, and coffee. It wus settled in peace and
calmness. He looked unstrung, very unstrung, and wan, considerable wan.
But I knew that I and the supper could string him up agin; and I felt
that I would not speak of the plan or the creek, or any agitatinâ€™
subject, until the supper was over, which resolve I follered. After the
table was cleared, and Josiah looked like a new man,--the girl beinâ€™ out
in the kitchen washinâ€™ the dishes,--I mentioned the creek; and he owned
up that he didnâ€™t know as it was exactly a creek, but â€œit was a dumb
NA
It is sweet, passing sweet, to be missed, to be necessary to the
happiness of one you love. But, at the same time, it is bitter to know
that your pardner has prevaricated to you, and so the sweet and the
bitter is mixed all through life.
I smiled and sithed simultaneous, as it were, and dropped down the
creek.
Then with a calm tone, but a beatinâ€™ heart, I took up the Plan, and
presented it to him. I wanted to find out the heights and depths of that
Plan before I said a word about my own adventures at Washington, D.C.
Oh, how that plan had worried me! But the minute I mentioned it, Josiah
looked as if he would sink. And at first he tried to move off the
subject, but I wouldnâ€™t let him. I held him up firm to that plan, and,
to use a poetical image, I hitched him there.
Says I, â€œYou know what you told me, Josiah,--you said that plan would

He groaned.
Says I, â€œYou know you said it would make you a lion, and me a lioness:
NA
He groaned awful.

He didnâ€™t speak, only sithed. But says I firmly, for I wus bound to come
to the truth of it,--

neednâ€™t have gone off on no towers of discovery, to have found that out.
NA
and melancholy,--
NA
NA
[Illustration: ARE YOU A LION?]
NA
went through me like a arrow,--that my worst apprehensions had been
realized, and that man had been a writing poetry.
But then I remembered that he had promised me years ago, that he never
would tackle the job agin. He begun to make a poem when we was first
married; but there wuznâ€™t no great harm done, for he had only wrote two
lines when I found it out and broke it up.
Beinâ€™ jest married, I had a good deal of influence over him; and he
promised me sacred, to never, _never_, as long as he lived and breathed,
try to write another line of poetry agin. We was married in the spring,
and these 2 lines was as follers:--
  â€œHow happified this spring appears--
NA
NA
to rhyme. And then was the time, then and there, that I made him promise
on the Old Testament, _never_ to try to write a line of poetry agin. And
I felt that he _could_ not do himself and me the bitter wrong to try it
agin, and still I trembled.
And right while I was tremblinâ€™, he returned, and silently laid â€œThe

hands. And the very first piece on which the eye of my spectacle rested,

[Illustration: JOSIAH BEING TREATED.]
I groaned and sithed to that extent that I was almost skairt at myself,
not knowinâ€™ but I would have the highstericks unbeknown to me (never
havinâ€™ had â€˜em, I didnâ€™t know exactly what the symptoms was), and I felt
dredfully. But anon, or pretty nigh anon, I grew calmer, and opened the
paper, and read. It seemed to be in answer to the men who had nominated
him for path-master, and it read as follers:--
JOSIAH ALLEN ON A PATH-MASTER.

adjacent worlds!
I thank you, fellow and male citizents, I thank you heartily, and
from the depths of my beinâ€™, for the honor you have heaped onto me, in
pintinâ€™ me path-master.
But I feel it to be my duty to decline it. I feel that I must keep
entirely out of political matters, and that I cannot be induced to be
path-master, or President, or even United-States senator. I have not got
the constitution to stand it. I donâ€™t feel well a good deal of the time.

circulate proper, I have got a weak back, and lumbago, and biles. And
I hainâ€™t a bit well. And I dassent put too much strain on myself, I
dassent.
And then, I am a husband and a father. I have sacred duties to perform
about, nearer and more sacred duties, that I dast not put aside for any
others.
I am a husband. I took a tender and confidinâ€™ woman away from a happy
home (Mother Smithâ€™s, in the east part of Jonesville), and transplanted
her (carried her in a one-horse wagon and a mare) into my own home. And
I feel that it is my first duty to make that home the brightest spot on
earth to her. That home is my dearest and most sacred treasure. And how
can I disturb its sweet peace with the wild turmoil of politics? I can
not. I dast not.
And politics are dangerous to enter into. There is bad folks in
Jonesville â€˜lection day,--bad men, and bad women. And I am liable to be
led astray. I donâ€™t want to be led astray, but I feel that I am liable
to.
NA
 swearinâ€™, nor never did.) I donâ€™t swear, but I think of them oaths
afterwards. Twice I thought of â€˜em right in prayer-meetinâ€™ time, and it
worrys me.
I have to see drinkinâ€™ goinâ€™ on. I donâ€™t want to drink; but they offer
to treat me, old friends do, and Samantha is afraid I shall yield to the
temptation; and I am most afraid of it myself.
Yes, politics is dangerous and hardeninâ€™; and, should I enter into the
wild conflict, I feel that I am in danger of losinâ€™ all them tender,
winninâ€™ qualities that first won me the love of my Samantha. I dare not
imperil her peace, and mine, by the effort.
I can not, I dast not, put aside these sacred duties that Providence has
laid upon me. My wiveâ€™s happiness is the first thing I must consider.
Can I leave her lonely and unhappy while I plunge into the wild turmoil
of caurkusses and town-meetinâ€™s, and while I go to â€˜lection, and vote?
No.
And the time I would have to spend in study in order to vote
intelligent, I feel as if that time I must use in strugglinâ€™ to promote
the welfare and happiness of my Samantha. No, I dassent vote, I dassent
another time.
Again, another reason. I have a little grandchild growinâ€™ up around me.
I owe a duty to her. I must dandle her on my knee. I must teach her the
path of virtue and happiness. If I do not, who will? For though there
are plenty to make laws, and to vote, little Samantha Joe has but one
grandpa on her motherâ€™s side.
And then, I have sights of cares. The Methodist church is to be kepâ€™ up:
I am one of the pillows of the church, and sometimes it rests heavy on
me. Sometimes I have to manage every way to get the preacherâ€™s salary. I
am school-trustee: I have to grapple with the deestrict every spring and
fall. The teachers are high-headed, the parents always dissatisfied,
and the children act like the Old Harry. I am the salesman in the
cheese-factory. Anarky and quarellinâ€™ rains over me offen that
cheese-factory; and its fault-findinâ€™, mistrustinâ€™ patrons, embitters my
life, and rends my mind with cares.
The care of providinâ€™ for my family wears onto me; for though Samantha
tends to things on the inside of the house, I have to tend to things
outside, and I have to provide the food she cooks.
And then, I have a great deal of work to do. Besides my barn-chores, and
all the wearinâ€™ cares I have mentioned, I have five acres of potatoes to
hoe and dig, a barn to shingle, a pig-pen to new cover, a smoke-house to
fix, a bed of beets and a bed of turnips to dig,--ruty bagys,--and four
big beds of onions to weed--dumb â€˜em! and six acres of corn to husk. My
barn-floor at this time is nearly covered with stooks. How dare I leave
my barn in confusion, and, by my disorderly doinâ€™s, run the risk of my
wiveâ€™s beinâ€™ so disgusted with my want of neatness and shiftlessness, as
to cause her to get dissatisfied with home and husband, and wander off
into paths of dissipation and vice? Oh! I dassent, I dassent, take the
resk! When I think of all the terrible evils that are liable to
come onto me, I feel that I dassent vote agin, as long as I live and
breathe--I dast not have any thing whatever to do with politics.
FINY. THE END.
I read it all out loud, every word of it, interrupted now and then, and
sometimes oftener, by the groans of my pardner. And as I finished, I
looked round at him, and I see his looks was dretful. And I says in
soothinâ€™ tones--for oh! how a companionâ€™s distress calls up the tender
feelinâ€™s of a lovinâ€™ female pardner!
Says I, â€œIt hainâ€™t the worst piece in the world, Josiah Allen! It is as

the makinâ€™ of her. And she hadnâ€™t half the reason to write it that I

and she lived in her brotherâ€™s family, and didnâ€™t have _no_ cares at
all.

time that I couldnâ€™t do a job as short as puttinâ€™ a letter in the
post-office. Why, I never see the time, even when the children was
little, and in cleaninâ€™ house, or sugarinâ€™-time, but what I could ride
into Jonesville every day, to say nothinâ€™ of once a year, and lay a vote
onto a pole. And you have as much time as I do, unless it is springs
and falls and hayinâ€™-time. And if _I_ could do it, _you_ could. I donâ€™t
approve of such talk.
â€œAnd you know very well that you and I had better spend a little of our

But it seemed as if he couldnâ€™t be soothed; and agin he kinder sithed

And bad as we both felt, this last speech of hisen made a glimmer of
light streak up, and shine into my future. Some like heat lighteninâ€™ on
summer eveninâ€™s. It hainâ€™t so much enjoyment at the time, but you know
it is goinâ€™ to clear the cloudy air of the to-morrow. And so its light
is sweet to you, though very curious, and crinkley.
And as mournful and sort oâ€™ curious as this time seemed to me and to
Josiah, yet this speech of hisen made me know that all private and
public peril connected with Hon. Josiah Allen was forever past away. And
that thought cast a rosy glow onto my to-morrows.
CHAPTER XI.
I found, on lookinâ€™ round the house the next morninâ€™, that Philury had
kepâ€™ things in quite good shape. Although truly the buttery looked like
a lonesome desert, and the cubbards like empty tents the Arabs had left
desolate.
But I knew I could soon make â€˜em blossom like the rosy with provisions,
which I proceeded at once to do, with Philuryâ€™s help.
While I wus a rollinâ€™ out the pie-crust, Philury told me â€œshe had

And while I wus a makinâ€™ the cookies, she broached it to me that â€œshe
NA
I wus agreable to the idee, and told her so. I like â€˜em both. Ury is a
tall, limber-jinted sort of a chap, sandy complected, and a little
round shouldered, but hard-workinâ€™ and industrious, and seems to take a
interest.
His habits are good: he never drinks any thing stronger than root-beer,
and he never uses tobacco--never has chawed any thing to our house
stronger than gum. He used that, I have thought sometimes, more than
wuz for his good. And I thought it must be expensive, he consumed such
quantities of it. But he told me he made it himself out of beeswax and
rozum.
And I told Josiah that I shouldnâ€™t say no more about it; because,
although it might be a foolish habit, gum was not what you might call
inebriatinâ€™; it was not a intoxicatinâ€™ beverage, and didnâ€™t endanger the
publick safety. So he kepâ€™ on a chawinâ€™ it, to home and abroad. He kepâ€™
at it all day, and at night if he felt lonesome.
I had mistrusted this, because I found a great chunk now and then on the
head-board; and I tackled him about it, and he owned up.
NA
NA
[Illustration: URY.]
Well, I thought that in a great lonesome world, that needed comfort
so much, if he found gum a consoler, I wouldnâ€™t break it up. So I kepâ€™
still, and would clean the head-board silently with kerosine and a
woolen rag.
And Philury is a likely girl. Very freckled, but modest and unassuming.
She is little, and has nice little features, and a round little face;
and though she canâ€™t be said to resemble it in every particular, yet
I never could think of any thing whenever I see her, but a nice little
turkey-egg.
NA
 whenever I asked her to do any thing. She always would, and always will,
I sâ€™pose, do jest what you tell her to,--as near as she can; and she is
thought a good deal of.
Wall, she has liked Ury for some time--that has been plain to see: she
thought her eyes of him, and he of her. He has got eight or nine hundred
dollars laid up; and I thought it was well enough for â€˜em to marry if
they wanted to, and so I told Josiah the first time he come into the
house that forenoon.
And he said â€œhe guessed our thinkinâ€™ about it wouldnâ€™t alter it much,
NA
NA
quite well about it. I like â€˜em both, and think theyâ€™ll make a happy
couple: and to show my willinâ€™ness still further, I mean to make a
weddinâ€™ for her; for she hainâ€™t got no mothers, and Miss Gowdy wonâ€™t
have it there, for you know there has been such a hardness between â€˜em
about that grindstun. So Iâ€™ll have it here, get a good supper, and have
NA
He hung back a little at first, but I argued him down. Says I,--
â€œI have heerd you say, time and agin, that you liked â€˜em, and wanted â€˜em
to do well: now, what do good wishes ammount to, unless you are willinâ€™
NA
well and happy, and that would be only a small expendature of wind, that
wouldnâ€™t be no loss to me, and no petickuler help to them. But if I show
my good will towards â€˜em by stirrinâ€™ up fruit-cakes and bride-cake, and
pickinâ€™ chickens, and pressinâ€™ â€˜em, and makinâ€™ ice-cream and coffee
and sandwitches, and workinâ€™ myself completely tired out, a wishinâ€™
â€˜em well, why, then they can depend on it that I am sincere in my good
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
So he did, and I did, and he never made no further objections to my
enterprise; and it was all understood that I should get their weddinâ€™
supper, and they should start from here on their tower.
And I offered, as she and Miss Gowdy didnâ€™t agree, that she might come
back here, if she wanted to, and get some quiltinâ€™ done, and get ready
for housekeepinâ€™. She was tickled enough with the idee, and said she
would help me enough to pay for her board. Uryâ€™s time wouldnâ€™t be out
till about a month later.
I told her she neednâ€™t work any for me. But she is a dretful handy
little thing about the house, or outdoors. When Josiah was sick, and
when the hired man happened to be away, she would go right out to the
barn, and fodder the cattle jest as well as a man could. And Josiah said
she milked faster than he could, to save his life. Her father had nine
girls and no boys; and he brought some of the girls up when they was
little, kinder boy-like, and they knew all about outdoor work.
Wall, it was all decided on, that they should come right back here jest
as soon as they ended their tower. They was a goinâ€™ to Uryâ€™s sisterâ€™s,
Miss Reuben Henzyâ€™s, and laid out to be gone about four days, or from
four days to a week.
And I went to cookinâ€™ for the weddinâ€™ about a week before it took place.
I thought I would invite the minister and his wife and family, and
Philuryâ€™s sister-in-lawâ€™s family,--the only one of her relations
who lived near us, and she was poor; and her classmates at Sunday
school,--there was twelve of â€˜em,--and our children and their families.
And I asked Miss Gowdeyâ€™ses folks, but didnâ€™t expect they would come,
owinâ€™ to that hardness about the grindstun. But everybody else come that
was invited; and though I am far from beinâ€™ the one that ort to say it,
NA
the far deeper language of consumption.
They all seemed to enjoy it: and Ury took out his gum, and put it under
the table-leaf before he begun to eat; and I found it there afterwards.
He was excited, I sâ€™pose, and forgot to take it agin when he left the
table.
Philury looked pretty. She had on a travellinâ€™-dress of a sort of a warm
brown,--a color that kinder set off her freckles. It was woosted,
and trimmed with velvet of a darker shade; and her hat and her gloves
matched.
Her dress was picked out to suit me. Ury wanted her to be married in
a yellow tarleton, trimmed with red. And she was jest that obleeginâ€™,
clever creeter, that she would have done it if it hadnâ€™t been for me.
[Illustration: THE WEDDING SUPPER.]
I says to her and to him,--
â€œWhat use would a yeller tarleton trimmed with red be to her after

sensible dress, that will do some good after marriage, besides lookinâ€™

it is painted in that literature--if you didnâ€™t really have nothinâ€™ to
do in the future, only to set on a rainbow, and eat honey, why, then,
a yaller tarleton dress with red trimminâ€™s would be jest the thing to

the same old dishcloths and wipinâ€™-towels and mops a waitinâ€™ for you to
grasp, with the same pair of hands. You will have to konfront brooms and
wash-tubs and darninâ€™-needles and socks, and etcetery, etcetery. And you
NA
She heerd to me; and that very day, after we had the talk, I took her
to Jonesville, drivinâ€™ the old mare myself, and stood by her while she
picked it out.
And thinkinâ€™ she was young and pretty, and would want somethinâ€™ gay and
bright, I bought some flannel for a morninâ€™-dress for her, and give it
to her for a present. It was a pretty, soft gray and pink, in stripes
about half a inch wide, and would be pretty for her for years, to wear
in the house, and when she didnâ€™t feel well.
I knew it would wash.
She was awful tickled with it. And I bought a present for Ury on that
same occasion,--two fine shirts, and two pair of socks, with gray toes
and heels, to match the morninâ€™-dress. I do love to see things kompared,
especially in such a time as this.
My weddinâ€™ present for â€˜em was a nice cane-seat rocker, black walnut,
good and stout, and very nice lookinâ€™. And, knowinâ€™ she hadnâ€™t no
mother to do for her, I gave her a pair of feather pillows and a
bed-quilt,--one that a aunt of mine had pieced up for me. It was a
blazinâ€™ star, a bright red and yeller, and it had always sort oâ€™ dazzled
me.
Ury worshiped it. I had kept it on his bed ever sense I knew what
feelinâ€™s he had for it. He had said â€œthat he didnâ€™t see how any thing so
NA
time to part with it.
Wall, they had lots of good presents. I had advised the children, and
the Sunday-school children, that, if they was goinâ€™ to give â€˜em any
thing, they would give â€˜em somethinâ€™ that would do â€˜em some good.
Says I, â€œPerforated paper lambrequins, and feather flowers, and
cotton-yarn tidies, look well; but, after all, they are not what you may
call so nourishinâ€™ as some other things. And there will probable rise
in their future life contingencies where a painted match-box, and a
hair-pin receiver, and a card-case, will have no power to charm. Even
china vases and toilet-sets, although estimable, will not bring up a
NA
I sâ€™pose I convinced â€˜em; for, as I heerd afterwards, the class had
raised fifty cents apiece to get perforated paper, woosted yarn, and
crystal beads. But they took it, and got her a set of solid silver
teaspoons: the store-keeper threw off a dollar or two for the occasion.
They was good teaspoons.
And our children got two good linen table-cloths, and a set of
table-napkins; and the ministerâ€™s wife brought her four towels, and the
sister-in-law a patch-work bed-quilt. And Reuben Henzyâ€™s wife sent â€˜em
the money to buy â€˜em a set of chairs and a extension table; and a rich
uncle of hisen sent him the money for a ingrain carpet; and a rich uncle
of hern in the Ohio sent her the money for a bedroom set,--thirty-two
dollars, with the request that it should be light oak, with black-walnut
trimminâ€™s.
And I had all the things got, and took â€˜em up in one of our chambers,
so folks could see â€˜em. And I beset Josiah Allen to give â€˜em for his
present, a nice bedroom carpet. But no: he had got his mind made up to
give Ury a yearlinâ€™ calf, and calf it must be. But he said â€œhe would
give in to me so fur, that, seeinâ€™ I wanted to make such a show, if I
NA
But I wouldnâ€™t parlay with him.
Wall, the weddinâ€™ went off first-rate: things went to suit me, all but
one thing. I didnâ€™t love to see Ury chew gum all the time they was beinâ€™
married. But he took it out and held it in his hand when he said â€œYes,
NA
she was asked if she would have Ury, she curchied, and said, â€œYes, if
NA
was a passinâ€™ him to her. She is a good-natured little thing, and always
was, and willinâ€™.
Wall, they was married about four oâ€™clock in the afternoon; and Josiah
sot out with â€˜em, to take â€˜em to the six oâ€™clock train, for their tower.
The company staid a half-hour or so afterwards: and the children stayed
a little longer, to help me do up the work; and finally they went. And
I went up into the spare chamber, and sort oâ€™ fixed Philuryâ€™s things to
the best advantage; for I knew the neighbors would be in to look at â€˜em.
And I was a standinâ€™ there as calm and happy as the buro or table,--and
they looked very light and cheerful,--when all of a sudden the door
opened, and in walked Ury Henzy, and asked me,--
NA
You could have knocked me down with a pin-feather, as it were, I was so
smut and dumb-foundered.

NA
curious.

NA
NA
Says I, â€œThen, you be a ghost: you hainâ€™t Ury, and you neednâ€™t say you

But jest at that minute in come Josiah Allen a snickerinâ€™; and says
he,--
â€œI have done it now, Samantha. I have done somethinâ€™ now, that is new
NA
And as he see my strange and awful looks, he continued, â€œYou know, you
always say that you want a change now and then, and somethinâ€™ new, to

with you. Now tell me at once, what you have done, Josiah Allen! I know

Says I faintly, â€œI guess you wonâ€™t be troubled about gettinâ€™ a patent

said she would love to go and see her sister in Buffalo; and Ury, of
course, wanted to go and see his sister in Rochester. And I proposed to
â€˜em that she should go first to Buffalo, and see her folks, and when she
got back, he should go to Rochester, and see his folks. I told her that
I needed Uryâ€™s help, and she could jest as well go alone as not, after
we got her ticket. And then in a week or so, when she had got her visit
made out, she could come back, and help do the chores, and tend to
things, and Ury could go. Ury hung back at first. But she smiled, and
NA
I groaned aloud, â€œThat clever little creeter! You have imposed upon her,
NA
â€œImposed upon her? I have made her a heroine.
â€œFolks will make as much agin of her. I donâ€™t believe any female ever

NA
â€œIt will make her sought after. I told her it would. Folks will jest run

Says I, â€œJosiah Allen, you did it because you didnâ€™t want to milk. Donâ€™t
try to make out that you had a good motive for this awful deed. Oh,
NA
â€œWall, dang it all, when they are a talkinâ€™ about this, they wonâ€™t be
NA
NA

â€œIâ€™d like to know why it hainâ€™t jest as well for â€˜em to go one at a
time? They are both _a goin_ You neednâ€™t worry about _that_. I hainâ€™t a

I groaned awful; and he snapped out,--
NA
NA
NA
â€œThat poor little freckled thing is with her folks by this time, as
NA
to feel bad about what he had done, I could see it by his looks; but
he tried to keep up, and says he, â€œMy conscience is clear, clear as
a crystal goblet; and my stomack is as empty as one. I didnâ€™t eat a
mouthful of supper. Cake, cake, and ice-cream, and jell! a dog couldnâ€™t

And then he started out; and I went down, and got a good supper, but I
sithed and groaned powerful and frequent.
Philury got home safely from her bridal tower, lookinâ€™ clever, but
considerable lonesome.
Truly, men are handy on many occasions, and in no place do they seem
more useful and necessary than on a weddinâ€™ tower.
Ury seemed considerable tickled to have her back agin. And Josiah would
whisper to me every chance he got,--
â€œThat now she had got back to help him, it was Uryâ€™s turn to go, and
NA
stands up for his sect.
And I would answer him every time,--
â€œThat if I lived, Philury and Ury should go off on a tower together,
NA
And Josiah would look cross and dissatisfied, and mutter somethinâ€™ about
the milkinâ€™. _There was where the shoe pinched_.
Wall, right when he was a mutterinâ€™ one day, Cicely got back from
Washington. And he stopped lookinâ€™ cross, and looked placid, and
sunshiny. That man thinks his eyes of Cicely, both of â€˜em; and so do I.
But I see that she looked fagged out.
And she told me how hard she had worked ever sence she had been gone.
She had been to some of the biggest temperance meetinâ€™s, and had done
every thing she could with her influence and her money. She was willinâ€™
to spend her money like rain-water, if it would help any.
But she said it seemed as if the powers against it was greater than
ever, and she was heart-sick and weary.
She had had another letter from the executor, too, that worried her.
She told me that, after she went up to her room at night, and the boy
was asleep.
She had took off her heavy mourninâ€™-dress, covered with crape, and put
on a pretty white loose dress; and she laid her head down in my lap, and
I smoothed her shininâ€™ hair, and says to her,--
â€œYou are all tired out to-night, Cicely: youâ€™ll feel better in the
NA
But she didnâ€™t: she was sick in bed the next day, and for two or three
days.
And it was arranged, that, jest as quick as she got well enough to go,
I was to go with her to see the executor, to see if we couldnâ€™t make him
change his mind. It was only half a dayâ€™s ride on the cars, and Iâ€™d go
further to please her.
But she was sick for most a week. And the boy meant to be good. He
wanted to be, and I know it.
But though he was such a sweet disposition, and easy to mind, he was
dretful easy led away by temptation, and other boys.
Now, Cicely had told him that he _must not_ go a fishinâ€™ in the creek
back of the house, there was such deep places in it; and he must not go
there till he got older.
And he would _mean_ to mind, I would know it by his looks. He would look
good and promise. But mebby in a hourâ€™s time little Let Peedick would
stroll over here, and beset the boy to go; and the next thing sheâ€™d
know, he would be down to the creek, fishinâ€™ with a bent pin.
[Illustration: LED ASTRAY.]
And Cicely had told him he _mustnâ€™t_ go in a swimminâ€™. But he went;
and because it made his mother feel bad, he would deceive her jest as
good-natured as you ever see.
Why, once he come in with his pretty brown curls all wet, and his little
shirt on wrong side out.
He was kinder whistlinâ€™, and tryinâ€™ to act indifferent and innocent. And
when his mother questioned him about it, he said,--
â€œHe had drinked so much water, that it had soaked through somehow to his

We could hear Letty a whistlinâ€™ out to the barn, and we knew he stood
NA
But we didnâ€™t ask.
But when the boy see that his actinâ€™ and behavinâ€™ made his mother feel
real bad, he would ask her forgiveness jest as sweet; and I knew he
meant to do jest right, and mebby he would for as much as an hour, or
till some temptation come along--or boy.
But the good-tempered easiness to be led astray made Cicely feel like
death: she had seen it in another; she see it was a inherited trait. And
she could see jest how hard it was goinâ€™ to make his future: she would
try her best to break him of it. But how, how was she goinâ€™ to do it,
with them weak, good-natured lips, and that chin?
But she tried, and she prayed.
And, oh, how we all loved the boy! We loved him as we did the apples in
our eyes.
But as I said, he was a child that had his spells. Sometimes he would
be very truthful and honest,--most too much so. That was when he had his
sort oâ€™ dreamy spells.
[Illustration: THE BOYâ€™S EXPLANATION.]
I know one day, she that wus Kezier Lum come here a visitinâ€™. She is
middlinâ€™ old, and dretful humbly.
Paul sot and looked at her face for a long time, with that sort of a
dreamy look of hisen; and finally he says,--
NA
And she says,--
NA
And he says,--
â€œI think I would rather have died young, than to grow up, and be so

[Illustration: SHE THAT WUS KEZIER LUM.]
I riz up, and led him out of the room quick, and told him â€œnever to talk
NA
And he says,--
NA
NA
â€œMother punished me last night for not telling the truth, and told me to

And then I tried to explain things to him; and he looked sweet, and said
NA
He never thought of doinâ€™ it in the first place, and I knew it. And I
declare, I thought to myself, as I went back into the room,--
â€œWe whip children for tellinâ€™ lies, and shake â€˜em for tellinâ€™ the truth.
NA
But when I went back into the room, I see Kezier was mad. And she said
in the course of our conversation, that â€œshe thought Cicely was too
much took up on the subject of intemperance, and some folks said she was
NA
Kezier was always a high-headed sort of a woman, without a nerve in her
body. I donâ€™t believe her teeth has got nerves; though I wouldnâ€™t want
to swear to it, never havinâ€™ filled any for her.
And I says back to her, for it made me mad to see Cicely run,--
Says I, â€œShe hainâ€™t the first one that has been called crazy, when they
wus workinâ€™ for truth and right. And if the old possles stood it, to be
NA
NA
NA
NA
â€œto sâ€™posen the case,--sâ€™posen the one we loved best in the world, your
Ebineezer, or my Josiah, should have been ruined, and led into murder,
by drinkinâ€™ milk, donâ€™t you believe we should have been sort oâ€™ crazy
NA
NA
There it wuz--she hadnâ€™t no imagination.
NA
NA
And so she did, sweet little soul.
But day by day I could see that her eagerness to accomplish what she had
sot out to, her awful anxiety about the boyâ€™s future, wus a wearinâ€™ on
her: the active, keen mind, the throbbinâ€™, achinâ€™ heart, was a wearinâ€™
out the tender body.
Her eyes got bigger and bigger every day; and her face got the
solemnest, curiusest look to it, that I ever see.
And her cheeks looked more and more like the pure white blow of the
Sweet Cicely, only at times there would be a red upon â€˜em, as if a leaf
out of a scarlet rose had dropped dowrn upon their pure whiteness.
That would be in the afternoon; and there would be such a dazzlinâ€™
brightness in her eyes, that I used to wonder if it was the fire of
immortality a beinâ€™ kindled there, in them big, sad eyes.
And right about this time the executor (and I wish he could have been
executed with a horse-whip: he knew how she felt about it)--he wuz sot,
a good man, but sot. Why, his own sir name wuz never more sot in the
ground than he wuz sot on top of it. And he didnâ€™t like a womanâ€™s
interference. He wrote to her that one of her stores, that he had always
rented for the sale of factory-cloth and sheepâ€™s clothinâ€™, lambâ€™s-wool
blankets, and etcetery, he had had such a good offer for it, to open a
new saloon and billiard-room, that he had rented it for that purpose;
and he told how much more he got for it. That made 4 drinkinâ€™ saloons,
that wuz in the boyâ€™s property. Every one of â€˜em, so Cicely felt, a
drawinâ€™ some other motherâ€™s boys down to ruin.
Cicely thought of it nights a sight, so she said,--said she was afraid
the curses of these mothers would fall on the boy.
And her eyes kepâ€™ a growinâ€™ bigger and solemner like, and her face
grew thinner and thinner, and that red flush would burn onto her cheeks
regular every afternoon, and she begun to cough bad.
But one day she felt better, and was anxious to go. So she and I went to
see the executor, Condelick Post.
We left the boy with Philury. Josiah took us to the cars, and we arrove
there at 1 P.M. We went to the tarven, and got dinner, and then sot out
for Mr. Postâ€™ses office.
[Illustration: CONDELICK POST.]
He greeted Cicely with so much politeness and courtesy, and smiled so at
her, that I knew in my own mind that all she would have to do would be
to tell her errent. I knew he would do every thing jest as she wanted
him to. His smile was truly bland--I donâ€™t think I ever see a blander
one, or amiabler.
I guess she was kinder encouraged, too, for she begun real sort oâ€™
cheerful a tellinâ€™ what she come for,--that she wanted him to rent these
buildinâ€™s for some other purpose than drinkinâ€™ and billiard saloons.
And he went on in jest as cheerful a way, almost jokeuler, to tell
her â€œthat he couldnâ€™t do any thing of the kind, and he was doing the
NA
And then Cicely, in a courteus, reasonable voice, begun to argue with
him; told him jest how bad she felt about it, and urged him to grant her
request.
But no, the pyramids couldnâ€™t be no more sot than he wuz, nor not half
so polite.
And then she dropped her own sufferings in the matter, and argued the
right of the thing.
She said when she was married, her husband took the whole of her
property, and invested it for her in these very buildings. And in
reality, it was her own property. The most of her husbandâ€™s wealth was
in the mills and government bonds. But she wanted her money invested
here, because she wanted a larger interest. And she was intending to let
the interest accumulate, and found a free library, and build a chapel,
for the workmen at the mills.
And says she, â€œIs it _right_ that my own property should be used for
NA
â€œWicked? why, my dear madam! it brings in a larger interest than any
other investment that I have been able to make. And you know your
husbandâ€™s will provides handsomely for you--the yearly allowance is very
NA
NA
â€œYes, it is very handsome indeed. And by the time Paul is of age, in the
way I am managing the property now, he will be the richest young man
in this section of the State. The revenue of which you make complaints,
NA
â€œIt will seem to be loaded with curses, weighed down with the weight of
NA
â€œAll imagination, my dear madam! You have a vivid imagination. But there

NA
she, with the red spot growinâ€™ brighter on her cheek, and her eyes
brighter,--â€œdo you know, if one did not possess great faith, they would
NA
NA
â€œYou know, Mr. Post, just how my husband died: you know he was killed
by intemperance. A drinking-saloon was just as surely the cause of his
death, as the sword is, that pierces through a manâ€™s heart. Intemperance
was the cause of his crime. He, the one I loved better than my own self,

And her eyes looked as big and wild and wretched, as if she was lookinâ€™
down the endless ages of eternity, a tryinâ€™ to find her love, and knew
she couldnâ€™t. All this was in her eyes, in her voice. But she seemed to
conquer her emotion by a mighty effort, tried to smother it down, and
speak calmly for the sake of her boy.
â€œAnd now, after I have suffered by it as I have, is it right, is it
just, that I should be compelled to allow my property to be used to
make other womenâ€™s hearts, other mothersâ€™ hearts, ache as mine must ache

â€œBut, my dear madam, the law, as it is now, gives me the right to do as

â€œI am pleading for justice, right: you have it in your power to grant my

You see, he went on, as men used to went on, to females years ago.
He forgot that that Alonzo and Melissa style of talkinâ€™ to wimmen had
almost entirely gone out of fashion. And it was a good deal more stylish
now to talk to wimmen as if they wuz human beinâ€™s, and men wuz too.
But Cicely looked at him calm and earnest, and says,--
NA
NA
â€œWill you let this store remain as it is, and rent those other saloons
NA
â€œO my dear, dear madam! What can you be thinking of? The rent that I get
from those four buildings is equal in amount to any eight of the other
buildings of the same size. I cannot, I cannot, consent to make any

NA
â€œI _cannot_, my dear madam: I prefer to put it in that way,--I cannot. I
do not see as you do in the matter. And as the law empowers me to use my
own discretion in renting the buildings, investing money, etc., I shall

Cicely got up: she was white as snow now, but as quiet as snow ever wus.
Mr. Post got up, too, about the politest actinâ€™ man I ever see, a movinâ€™
chairs out of the way, and a smilinâ€™, and a waitinâ€™ on us out. He was
ready to give plenty of politeness to Cicely, but no justice.
And I guess he was kinder sorry to see how white and sad she looked, for
he spoke out in a sort of a comfortinâ€™ voice,--
â€œYou have had great sorrows, Mrs. Slide, but you have also a great deal
to comfort you. Just think of how many other widows have been left in
NA
Cicely turned then, and made the longest speech I ever heard her make.
[Illustration: LICENSED WRETCHEDNESS.]
â€œYes, many a drunkardâ€™s wife is clothed in rags, and goes hungry to bed
at night, with her hungry children crying for bread about her. She can
lie on her cold pile of rags, with the snow sifting down on her, and
think that her husband, a sober, honest man once, was made a low,
brutal wretch by intemperance; that he drank up all his property, killed
himself by strong drink, was buried in a pauperâ€™s grave, and left a
starving wife and children, to live if they could. The cold of winter
freezes her, the want of food makes her faint, and to see her little
ones starving about her makes her heart ache, no doubt. I have plenty of

Says she, stretching out her little white hands, and smilinâ€™ the
bitterest smile I ever see on Cicelyâ€™s face,--
â€œBut do you not think, that, as I lie on my warm, soft couch at night,
my heart is wrung by a keener pang than that drunkardâ€™s wife can ever
know? I can lie and think that by my means, my wealth, I am making just
such homes as that, making just such broken hearts, just such starving
children, filling just such paupersâ€™ graves,--laying up a long store of
curses and judgments, for my boyâ€™s inheritance. And I am powerless to do

And she opened the door, and walked right out. And Mr. Post stood and
smiled till we got to the bottom of the stairs.
â€œGood-afternoon, _good_-afternoon, my clear madam, call again; happy to
NA
Wall, Cicely went right to bed the minute we got home; and she never eat
a mite of supper, only drinked a cup of tea, and thanked me so pretty
for bringinâ€™ it to her.
And there was such a sad and helpless, and sort of a outraged, look in
her pretty brown eyes, some as a noble animal might have, who wus at bay
with the cruel hunters all round it. And so I told Josiah after I went
down-stairs.
And the boy overheard me, and asked me 87 questions about â€œa animal at
NA
water? or--
Oh my land! my land! How I did suffer!
But Cicely grew worse fast, from that very day. She seemed to run right
down.
CHAPTER XII.
One day Cicely had been worryinâ€™ dretfully all the forenoon about the
boy. And I declare, it seemed so pitiful to hear her talk and forebode
about him, with her face lookinâ€™ so wan and white, and her big eyes
so sorrowful lookinâ€™, as if they was lookinâ€™ onto all the sadness
and trouble of the world, and couldnâ€™t help herself--such a sort of a
hopeless look, and lovinâ€™ and broken-hearted, that it was all I could do
to stand it without breakinâ€™ right down, and cry inâ€™ with her.
But I knew her state, and held firm. And she went over all the old
grounds agin to me, that she had foreboded on; and I went over all the
old grounds of soothing agin and agin.
Why, good land! I had had practice enough. For every day, and every
night, would she forebode and forebode, and I would soothe and soothe,
till I declare forâ€™t, I should have felt (to myself) a good deal like
a bread-and-milk poultice, or even lobelia or catnip, if my feelinâ€™s
on the subject hadnâ€™t been so dretful deep and solemn, deeper than any
poultice that was ever made--and solemner.
Why, Tirzah Ann says to me one day,--she had been settinâ€™ with Cicely
for a hour or two; and she come out a cryinâ€™, and says she,--
â€œMother, I donâ€™t see how you can stand it. It would break my heart to
see Cicelyâ€™s broken-hearted look, and hear her talk for half a day; and
NA
And I says, â€œTongue canâ€™t tell, Tirzah Ann, how your maâ€™s heart does
NA
leave a boy in the world with such temptations round him, and such a
chin on him, why, I donâ€™t know what I should do, and what I shouldnâ€™t

NA
of us wiped our eyes.
But I held firm before her, and reminded her every time, of what she
knew already,--â€œthat there was One who was strong, who comforted her in
NA
And sometimes she would be soothed for a little while, and sometimes she
wouldnâ€™t.
Wall, this day, as I said, she had worried and worried and worried. And
at last I had soothed her down, real soothed. And she asked me before
I went down-stairs, for a poem, a favorite one of hers,--â€œThe Celestial
NA
she would read a spell, and she guessed she should drop to sleep.
And as I was goinâ€™ out of the room, she called me back to hear a verse
or two she particularly liked, about the â€œendless, ageless peace of
NA
  â€œTrue vision of true beauty,
NA
And I stood calm, and heard her with a smooth, placid face, though I
knew my pies was a scorchinâ€™ in the oven, for I smelt â€˜em. I did well by
Cicely.
[Illustration: SAMANTHA LISTENING TO CICELY.]
After she finished it, I told her it was perfectly beautiful, and I left
her feelinâ€™ quite bright; and there wuznâ€™t but one of my pies spilte,
and I didnâ€™t care if it wuz. I wuznâ€™t goinâ€™ to have her feelinâ€™s hurt,
pies or no pies.
After I got my pies out, I went into my nearest neighborâ€™s on a errent,
tellinâ€™ Josiah to stay in Thomas Jeffersonâ€™s room, just acrost from
Cicelyâ€™s, soâ€™s if she wanted any thing, he could get it for her. I
wuznâ€™t gone over a hour, and, when I went back, I went up-stairs the
first thing; and I found Cicely a cryin,â€™ though there was a softer,
more contented look in her eyes than I had seen there for a long time.
NA
And she says,--
â€œOh! if I had been a better woman, I could have seen my mother! she has
NA
NA
But she put it away, and says in a sort of a solemn, happy tone,--
NA
She said it jest as earnest and serene as I ever heard any thing said;
and there was a look in her eyes some as there wuz when she come home
from her aunt Maryâ€™s, and told me â€œshe almost wished her aunt had died
while she was there, because she felt that her mother would be the angel
sent from heaven to convey her auntâ€™s soul home--and she could have seen
NA
There was that same sort of deep, soulful, sad, and yet happy look to
her eyes, as she repeated,--
â€œShe has been here! I was lying here, aunt Samantha, reading â€˜The
Celestial Country,â€™ not thinking of any thing but my book, when suddenly
I felt something fanning my forehead, like a wing passing gently over
my face. And then something said to me just as plain as I am speaking to
you, only, instead of being spoken aloud, it was said to my soul,--
â€œâ€˜You have wanted to see your mother: she is here with you.â€™
â€œAnd I dropped my book, and sprung up, and stood trembling, and reached
out my hands, and cried,--â€œâ€˜Mother! mother! where are you? Oh! how I
have wanted you, mother!â€™
â€œAnd then that same voice said to my heart again,--
â€œâ€˜God will take care of the boy.â€™
â€œAnd as I stood there trembling, the room seemed full. You know how you
would feel if your eyes were shut, and you were placed in a room full of
people. You would know they were there--you would feel their presence,
though you couldnâ€™t see them. You know what the Bible says,--â€˜Seeing we
are encompassed about by so great a cloud of witnesses.â€™ That word just
describes what I felt. There seemed to be all about me, a great cloud
of people. And I put my arms out, and made a rush through them, as you
would through a dense crowd, and said again,--
â€œâ€˜Mother! mother! where are you? Speak to me again.â€™
â€œAnd then, suddenly, there seemed to be a stir, a movement in the room,
something I was conscious of with some finer, more vivid sense than
hearing. It seemed to be a great crowd moving, receding. And farther
off, but clear, these words came to me again, sweet and solemn,--
â€œâ€˜God will take care of the boy.â€™
â€œAnd then I seemed to be alone. And I went out into the hall; and uncle
Josiah heard me, and he came out, and asked me what the matter was.
â€œAnd I told him â€˜I didnâ€™t know.â€™ And my strength left me then; and he
took me up in his arms, and brought me back into my room, and laid me on
NA
NA
â€œBecause I wasnâ€™t good enough to see my mother. If I had only been good
enough, I could have seen her. For she was here, aunt Samantha, right in
NA
Her eyes wus so big and solemn and earnest, that I knew she meant what
she said. But I soothed her down as well as I could, and I says,--
NA
NA
NA
Wall, after a while Cicely stopped cryinâ€™, and dropped to sleep.
And now what I am goinâ€™ to tell you is the _truth_. You can believe it,
or not, jest as you are a mind to; but it is the _truth_.
That night, at sundown, Thomas J. come in with a telegram for Cicely;
and she says, without actinâ€™ a mite surprised,--
NA
And sure enough, when she opened it, it was so. She died jest before the
time Cicely come out into the hall. Josiah remembered plain. The clock
had jest struck two as she opened the door.
Her aunt died at two.
This is the plain truth; and I will make oath to it, and so will Josiah.
And whether Cicely dremp it, or whether she didnâ€™t; whether it wus jest
a coincidinâ€™ coincidence, her havinâ€™ these feelinâ€™s at exactly the time
her aunt died, or not,--I donâ€™t know any more than you do. I jest put
down the facts, and you can draw your own inferences from â€˜em, and draw
â€˜em jest as fur as you want to, and as many of â€˜em.
[Illustration: THOMAS JEFFERSON BRINGING CICELYâ€™S TELEGRAM.]
But that night, way along in the night, as I lay awake a musinâ€™ on it,
and a wonderinâ€™,--for I say plain that my specks hainâ€™t strong enough to
see through the mysteries that wrap us round on every side,--I sâ€™posed
my companion wus asleep; but he spoke out sudden like, and decided, as
if I had been a disputinâ€™ of him,--
NA
NA
NA
NA
And I give up, that most probable she did, or didnâ€™t, one of the two.
NA
But anyway, from that night, she didnâ€™t worry one bit about the boy.
She would talk to him sights about his beinâ€™ a good boy, but she would
act and talk as if she was _sure_ he would. She would look at him, not
with the old, pitiful, agonized look, but with a sweet and happy light
in her eyes.
And I guessed that she thought that the laws would be changed before
the boy was of age. I thought that she felt real encouraged to think
the march of civilization was a marchinâ€™ on, pretty slow but sure,
and, before the boy got old enough to go out into a world full of
temptations, there would be wiser laws, purer influences, to help the
boy to be a good and noble man, which is about the best thing we know
of, here below.
No, she never worried one worry about him after that day, not a single
worry. But she made her will, and it was fixed lawful too. She wanted
Paul to stay with us till he was old enough to send off to school and
college. And she wanted her property and Paulâ€™s too, if he should die
before he was of age, should be used to found a school, and a home for
the children of drunkards. A good school and a Christian home, to teach
them and help them to be good, and good citizens.
Josiah Allen and Thomas J. and I was appinted to see to it, appinted
by law. It was to be right in them buildings that wus used now for
dram-shops: them very housen was to be used to send out good influences
and spirits into the world instead of the vile, murderous, brutal
spirits, they wus sendinâ€™ out now.
And wuznâ€™t it sort oâ€™ pitiful to think on, that Cicely had to _die_
before her property could be used as she wanted it to be,--could be
used to send out blessings into the world, instead of â€˜cursings and
wickedness, as it was now? It was pitiful to look on it with the eye of
a woman; but I kepâ€™ still, and tried to look on it with the eye of the
United States, and held firm.
And we give her our solemn promises, that in case the job fell to us
to do, it should be tended to, to the very best of our three abilities.
Thomas J., beinâ€™ a good lawyer, could be relied on.
The executor consented to it,--I sâ€™pose because he was so dretful
polite, and he thought it would be a comfort to Cicely. He knew there
wuznâ€™t much danger of its ever takinâ€™ place, for Paul was a healthy
child. And his appetite was perfectly startlinâ€™ to any one who never see
a childâ€™s appetite.
I estimated, and estimated calmly, that there wuznâ€™t a hour of the day
that he couldnâ€™t eat a good, hearty meal. But truly, it needed a strong
diet to keep up his strength. For oh! oh! the questions that child would
ask! He would get me and Philury pantinâ€™ for breath in the house, and
then go out with calmness and strength to fatigue his uncle Josiah and
Ury nearly unto death.
But they loved him, and so did I, with a deep, pantinâ€™, tired-out
affection. We loved him better and better as the days rolled by: the
tireder we got with him seeminâ€™ly, the more we loved him.
But one hope that had boyed me up durinâ€™ the first weeks of my
intercourse with him, died out. I did think, that, in the course of
time, he would get all asked out. There wouldnâ€™t be a thing more in
heavens or on earth, or under the earth, that he hadnâ€™t enquired in
perticular about.
But as days passed by, I see the fallicy of my hopes. Insperation seemed
to come to him; questions would spring up spontanious in his mind; the
more he asked, the more spontaniouser they seemed to spring.
Now, for instance, one eveninâ€™ he asked me about 3,000 questions about
the Atlantic Ocian, its whales and sharks and tides and steamships and
islands and pirates and cable and sailors and coral and salt, and etc.,
etc., and etcetery; and after a hour or two he couldnâ€™t think of another
thing to ask, seeminâ€™ly. And I begun to get real encouraged, though
fagged to the very outmost limit of fag, when he drew a long breath, and
says with a perfectly fresh, vigorous look,--
[Illustration: THE BOY ASKING QUESTIONS.]
NA
And I answered kindly, but with firmness,--
NA
NA
hung like a slender golden bow in the west, â€œdonâ€™t you think the moon
to-night is shaped some like a hammock? and if I set down in it with my
feet hanging out, would I be dizzy? and if I should curl my feet up, and
lay back in it, and sail--and sail--and sail up into the sky, could I
find out about things up in the heavens? Could I find the One up there
that set me to breathing? And who made the One that made me? And where
was I before I was made?--and uncle Josiah and Ury? And why wouldnâ€™t I
tell him where we was before we was anywhere? and if we wasnâ€™t anywhere,
NA
Oh, dear me! dear me! how I did suffer!
But a better child never lived than he was, and I would have loved to
seen anybody dispute it. He was a lovely child, and very deep.
And he would back up to you, and get up into your lap, with such a calm,
assured air of owning you, as if you was his possession by right of
discovery. And he would look up into your face with such a trustinâ€™,
angelic look as he tackled you, that, no matter how tuckered out you
would get, you was jest as ready for him the next time, jest as ready to
be tackled and tuckered.
He was up with his mother a good deal. He would get up on the bed, and
lay by her side; and she would hold him close, and talk good to him,
dretful good.
I heard her tellinâ€™ him one day, that, â€œif ever he had a manâ€™s influence
and strength, he must use them wisely, and deal tenderly and gently
by those who were weaker, and in his power. That a manly man was never
ashamed of doing what was right, no matter how many opposed him; that it
was manly and noble to be pure and good, and helpful to all who needed
help.
â€œAnd he must remember, if he ever got tired out and discouraged trying
to be good himself, and helping others to be good, that he was never
alone, that his loving Father would always be with him, and _she_
should. She should never be far away from her boy.
â€œAnd it would only be a little while at the longest, before she should
take him in her arms again, before life here would end, and the new and
glorious life begin, that he must fit himself for. That life here was so
short that it wasnâ€™t worth while to spend any part of it in less worthy
NA
And I thought as I listened to her, that her talk had the simplicity of
a child, and the wisdom of all the philosiphers.
Yes, she would talk to him dretful good, a holdinâ€™ him close in her
arms, and lookinâ€™ on him with that fur-off, happy look in her eyes, that
I loved and hated to see,--loved to see because it was so beautiful and
sweet, hated to see because it seemed to set her so fur apart from all
of us.
It seemed as though, while her body was here below, she herself was a
livinâ€™ in another world than ourn: you could see its bright radience in
her eyes, hear its sweet and peaceful echoes in her voice.
She was with us, and she wuznâ€™t with us; and Iâ€™d smile and cry about it,
and cry and smile, and couldnâ€™t help it, and didnâ€™t want to.
And seeinâ€™ her so satisfied about the boy--why, seeinâ€™ her feel so good
about him, made us feel good too. And seeinâ€™ her so contented and happy,
made us contented and happy--some.
And so the peaceful weeks went by, Cicely growinâ€™ weaker and weaker
all the time in body, but happier and happier in her mind; so sweet and
serene, that we all felt, that, instead of being sad, it was somethinâ€™
beautiful to die.
And as the long, sweet days passed by, the look in her eyes grew
clearer,--the look that reminded us of the summer skies in early
morninâ€™, soft and dark, with a prophecy in them of the coming brightness
and glory of the full day.
[Illustration: TIRZAH ANN AND MAGGIE IN THE DEMOCRAT.]
The morninâ€™ of the last day in June Cicely was not so well; and I sent
for the doctor in the morninâ€™, and told Ury to have Tirzah Ann and
Maggie come home and spend the day. Which they did.
And in the afternoon she grew worse so fast, that towards night I sent
for the doctor again.
He didnâ€™t give any hope, and said the end was very near. A little before
night the boys come,--Thomas Jefferson and Whitfield.
The sun went down; and it was a clear, beautiful eveninâ€™, though there
was no moon. All was still in the house: the lamp was lighted, but the
doors and windows was open, and the smell of the blossoms outside come
in sweet; and every thing seemed so peacful and calm, that we could not
feel sorrowful, much as we loved her.
She had wanted the boy on the bed with her; and I told Josiah and the
children we would go out, and leave her alone with him. Only, the doctor
sot by the window, with the lamp on a little stand by the side of him,
and the morninâ€™-glories hanginâ€™ their clusters down between him and the
sweet, still night outside.
Cicelyâ€™s voice was very low and faint; but we could hear her talkinâ€™ to
him, good, I know, though I didnâ€™t hear her words. At last it was
all still, and we heard the doctor go to the bedside; and we all went
in,--Josiah and the children and me. And as we stood there, a light fell
on Cicelyâ€™s face,--every one in the room saw it,--a white, pure
light, like no other light on earth, unless it was something like that
wonderful new light--that has a soul. It was something like that clear
white light, falling through a soft shade. It was jest as plainly
visible to us as the lamplight at the other end of the room.
It rested there on her sweet face, on her wide-open brown eyes, on her
smilinâ€™ lips. She lay there, rapt, illumined, glorified, apart from us
all. For that strange, beautiful glow on her face wrapped her about,
separated her from us all, who stood outside.
The boy had fallen asleep, his dimpled arms around her neck, and his
moist, rosy face against her white one. She held him there close to her
heart; but in the awe, the wonder of what we saw, we hardly noticed the
boy.
She heard voices we could not hear, for she answered them in low
tones,--contented, happy tones. She saw faces we couldnâ€™t see, for she
looked at them with wondernâ€™ rapture in her eyes. She was away from us,
fur away from us who loved her,--we who were on this earth still. Love
still held her here, human love yet held her by a slight link to the
human; but her sweet soul had got with its true kindred, the pure in
heart.
[Illustration: DEATH OF CICELY.]
But still her arms was round the boy,--white, soft arms of flesh, that
held him close to her heart. And at the very last, she fixed her eyes
on him; and, oh! what a look that was,--a look of such full peace, and
rapturous content, as if she knew all, and was satisfied with all that
should happen to him. As if her care for him, her love for him, had
blossomed, and bore the ripe fruit of blessedness.
At last that beautiful light grew dimmer, and more dim, till it was
gone--gone with the pure soul of our sweet Cicely.
That night, way along in the night, I wuznâ€™t sleeping, and I wuznâ€™t
crying, though I had loved Cicely so well. No: I felt lifted up in my
mind, inspired, as if I had seen somethinâ€™ so beautiful that I could
never forget it. I felt perhaps somethinâ€™ as our old 4 mothers did when
they would see an angel standinâ€™ with furled wings outside their tents.
I thought Josiah was asleep; but it seems he wuznâ€™t, for he spoke out
sort oâ€™ decided like,--

CHAPTER XIII.
It was a lovely morninâ€™ about three weeks after Cicelyâ€™s death. Josiah
had to go to Jonesville to mill, and the boy wanted to go to; and so I
put on his little cloak and hat, and told him he might go.
We didnâ€™t act cast down and gloomy before the boy, Josiah and me didnâ€™t.
He had worried for his ma dretfully, at first. But we had made every
thing of him, and petted him. And I had told him that she had gone to a
lovely place, and was there a waitinâ€™ for him. And I would say it to him
with as cheerful a face as I could. (I knew I could do my own cryinâ€™,
out to one side.)
And he believed me. He believed every word I said to him. And he would

And â€œif it was inside the gate, that uncle Josiah had read about,--that
gate that was big and white, like a pearl? And if it would float down
through the sky some day, and stand still in front of him? And would
the gate swing open so he could see into the City? and would it be all
glorious with golden streets, and shining, and full of light? And
would his mamma Cicely stand just inside, and reach out her arms to

And then the boy would sob and cry. And Iâ€™d soothe him, and swaller
NA
sobbinâ€™ so.
And then heâ€™d ask, â€œWould she take him in her arms, and be glad to see
NA
And Iâ€™d comfort him, and tell him, â€œNo, it wouldnâ€™t be but a little time
NA
And didnâ€™t think it was wicked, for it wuznâ€™t long anyway. For â€œour days
NA
Wall, he loved us, some. And we loved him, and did well by him; and
beinâ€™ a child, we could sometimes comfort him with childish things.
And this morninâ€™ he wus all excitement about goinâ€™ to Jonesville with
his uncle Josiah. And I gin him some pennys to get some oranges for him
and the babe, and they set off feelinâ€™ quite chirk.
And I sot down to mend a vest for my Josiah. And I was a settinâ€™ there a
mendinâ€™ it,--one of the pockets had gin out, and it was frayed round the
edges.
And I sot there a sewinâ€™ on that fray, peaceful and calm and serene as
the outside of the vest, which was farmerâ€™s satin, and very smooth and
shininâ€™. The weather also wus as mild and serene as the vest, if not
serener. I had got my work all done up as slick as a pin: the floor
glittered like yellow glass, the stove shone a agreable black, a good
dinner was a cookinâ€™. And I sot there, happy, as I say; for though,
when I had done so much work that morninâ€™, if that vest had belonged to
anybody else, it would have looked like a stent to me, I didnâ€™t mind it,
for it was for my Josiah: and love makes labor light,--light as day.
I was jest a thinkinâ€™ this, and a thinkinâ€™ that though I had jest told
Josiah, from a sense of duty, that â€œhe had broke that pocket down by
lugginâ€™ round so much stuff in it, and there was no sense in actinâ€™ as
NA
 though I had spoken to him thus, from a sense of duty, tryinâ€™ to keep
him straight and upright in his demeaner,--still, I was a thinkinâ€™ how
pleasant it wuz to work for them you loved, and that loved you: for
though he had snapped me up considerable snappish, and said â€œhe should
carry round in his pockets as much as he was a minter; and if I didnâ€™t
NA
corner, and slammed the door considerable hard when he went out, still,
I knew that this slight pettishness was only the light bubbles that
rises above the sparkling wine. I knew his love for me lay pure and
clear and sparklinâ€™ in the very depths of his soul.
I was a settinâ€™ there, thinkinâ€™ about it, and thinkinâ€™ how true love,
such as mine and hisen, glorified a earthly existence, when all of a
sudden I heard a rap come onto the kitchen door right behind me; and I
NA
sort oâ€™ thin, and a patient, determined countenance onto him. A sort
of a persistent look to him, as if he wuznâ€™t one to be turned round
by trifles. I didnâ€™t dislike his looks a mite at first, and sot him a
chair.
But little did I think what was a cominâ€™. For, if you will believe it,
he hadnâ€™t much more than got sot down when he says to me right there, in
the middle of the forenoon, and right to my face,--the mean, miserable,
lowlived scamp,--says he, right there, in broad daylight, and without
blushing, or any thing, says he,--

I declare forâ€™t, my first thought was, to turn him right outdoors, and
shet the door in his face. And then agin, I thought, I am a member of
the meetinâ€™-house. I must be patient and long sufferinâ€™, and may be here
is a chance for me to do good. Thinksâ€™es I, if I was ever eloquent in a
good cause, I must be now. I must convince him of the nefariousness of
his conduct. And if soarinâ€™ in eloquence can do it, why, I must soar.
And so I begun.
Says I, wavinâ€™ my right hand in a broad, soarinâ€™, eloquent wave, â€œYoung
man, when you talk about buyinâ€™ and sellinâ€™ a feller, you are talkinâ€™
on a solemn subject,--buyin and sellinâ€™ attachments! Buyinâ€™ and sellinâ€™
fellers! It hainâ€™t nothinâ€™ new to me. Iâ€™ve hearn tell of such things,
but little did I suppose it was a subject I should ever be tackled on.
â€œBut I have hearn of it. I have hearn of wimmen sellinâ€™ themselves to
the highest bidder, with a minister for auctioneer and salesman. I have
hearn of fathers and mothers sellinâ€™ beauty and innocence and youth to
wicked old age for money--sellinâ€™ â€˜em right in the meetinâ€™-house, under
the very shadow of the steeple.
[Illustration: THEM THAT SELL DOVES.]
â€œJerusalem hainâ€™t the only village where Godâ€™s holy temple has been
polluted by money-changers and them that sell doves. Many a sweet
little dove of a girl is made by her father and mother, and other old
money-changers, to walk up to Godâ€™s holy altar, and swear to a lie.
They think her tellinâ€™ that lie, makes the infamous bargain more sacred,
makes the infamous life they have drove her into more respectable.
â€œThere was One who cleansed from such accursed traffic the old Jewish
temples, but He walks no more with humanity. If he did, would he not
walk up the broad aisles of our orthodox churches in American
cities, and release these doves, and overthrow the plots of these
money-changers?
â€œBut let me tell â€˜em, that though they canâ€™t see Him, He is there; and
the lash of His righteous wrath will surely descend, not upon their
bodies, but upon their guilty souls, teachinâ€™ them how much more
terrible it is to sell a life, with all its rich dowery of freedom,

Here my breath gin out, for I had used my very deepest principle tone;
and it uses up a fearful ammount of wind, and is tuckerinâ€™ beyend what
any one could imagine of tucker. You _have_ to stop to collect breath.
And he looked at me with that same stiddy, patient, modest look of
hisen; and says he, in that low, determined voice,--
â€œWhat you say, madam, is very true, and even beautiful and eloquent: but
time is valuable to me; and as I said, I stopped here this morning to

â€œI know you did: I heard you with my own ears. If it had come through
two or three, or even one, pair of ears besides my own, I couldnâ€™t have
believed â€˜em--I never could have believed that any human creeter, male
or female, would have dared to stand up before me, and try to sell me a
feller! _Sell_ a feller to me! Why, even in my young days, do you sâ€™pose
I would ever try to _buy_ a feller?
â€œNo, sir! fellers must come free and spontaneous? or not at all. Never
was I the woman to advance one step towards any feller in the way of
courtship--havinâ€™ no occasion for it, beinâ€™ one that had more offers
than I knew what to do with, as I often tell my husband, Josiah Allen,
now, in our little differences of opinion. â€˜Time and agin,â€™ as I tell
him, â€˜I might have married, but held back.â€™ And never would I have
married, never, had not love gripped holt of my very soul, and drawed me
along up to the marriage alter. I loved the feller I married, and he was

Says he in that low, gentle tone, and lookinâ€™ modest and patient as a
lily, but as determined and sot as ever a iron teakettle was sot over a
stove,--
NA
Says I, â€œDonâ€™t you tell me that agin if you know what is good for
yourself. I guess I know my own mind. I was past the age of whifflinâ€™,
and foolinâ€™ round. I married that feller from pure love, and no other
reason under the heavens. For there wuznâ€™t any other reason only jest
NA
And for a moment, or two moments, my mind roamed back onto that old,
mysterious question that has haunted me more or less through my natural
life, for over twenty years. _Why_ did I marry Josiah Allen? But I
didnâ€™t revery on it long. I was too agitated, and wrought up; and I says
agin, in tones witherinâ€™ enough to wither him,--
NA
But the chap didnâ€™t look withered a mite: he stood there firm and
immovible, and says he,--
â€œI didnâ€™t mean no offense, mom. Sellinâ€™ attachments is what I get my
NA
NA
NA
â€œAs I said, mom, I get my livinâ€™ that way: and one of your neighbors
told me that your feller was an old one, and sort oâ€™ givinâ€™ out; and
I have got â€˜em with all the latest improvements, and--and she thought
NA
NA
will holler to Josiah. What do you sâ€™pose I want with another feller? Do
you sâ€™pose Iâ€™d swap Josiah Allen for all the fellers that ever swarmed
on the globe? What do you sâ€™pose I care for the latest improvements? If
a feller was made of pure gold from head to feet, with diamond eyes and
a garnet nose, do you sâ€™pose he would look so good to me as Josiah Allen
duz?
â€œAnd I would thank the neighbers to mind their own business, and let my
affairs alone. What if he is a gettinâ€™ old and wore out? What if he is
a givinâ€™ out? He is always kinder spindlinâ€™ in the spring of the year.
Some men winter harder than others: he is a little tizicky, and breathes
short, and his liver may not be the liver it was once; but he will come
round all right when the weather moderates. And mebby they meant to hint
and insinuate sunthinâ€™ about his beinâ€™ so bald, and losinâ€™ his teeth.
â€œBut Iâ€™ll let you know, and Iâ€™ll let the neighbors know, that I didnâ€™t
marry that man for hair; I didnâ€™t marry that man for teeth, and a
few locks more or less, or a handful of teeth, has no power over that
love,--that love that makes me say from the very depths of my soul, that

â€œI dare presume to say that your feller was good in the day of such
fellers. But every thing has its day: we make fellers far different

Says I sarcasticly, givinâ€™ him quite a piercinâ€™ look, â€œI know they do:
NA
NA
â€œYes, I know it is: I know that love, such love as hisen and mine, and
I know that truth and fidelity and constancy, _are_ old-fashioned. But
I thank God that our souls are clothed with that beautiful old fashion,
that seamless, flawless robe that wus cut out in Eden, and a few true

â€œBut your attachment will grow older and older, and give out entirely
NA
NA
NA
â€œNo, you neednâ€™t argue and contend--I say it will _never_ give out. It
is a heavenly gift dropped down from above, entirely unbeknown. True
love is not sought after, it comes; and when it comes, it stays.
Talk about love gettinâ€™ old--love _never_ grows old; talk about love
goinâ€™--love _never_ goes: that which goes is not love, though it has
been called so time and agin. Talk about love dyinâ€™--why, it _canâ€™t_
die, no more than the souls can, in which its sweet light is born.
Why, it is a flame that God Himself kindles: it is a bit of His own
brightness a shininâ€™ down through the darkness of our earthly life, and
is as immortal and indestructible as His own glory.
â€œIt is the only fountain of Eternal Youth that gushes up through this
dreary earthly soil, for the refreshinâ€™ of men and wimmen, in which the

would scorn to repair him. I _could_ if I wanted to,--his teeth could
be sharpened up, what he has got, and new ones sot in. And I could
cover his head over with red curls; or I could paint it black, and paste
transfer flowers onto it. I could have a sot flower sot right on the top
of his bald head, and a trailinâ€™ vine runninâ€™ round his forward. Or I
could trim it round with tattinâ€™, if I wanted to, and crystal beads.
I could repair him up so he would look gay. But do you sâ€™pose that any
artificials that was ever made, or any hair, if it was as luxuriant as
Ayerâ€™ses Vigor, could look so good to me as that old bald head that I
have seen a shininâ€™ acrost the table from me for so many years?
[Illustration: JOSIAH AFTER BEING REPAIRED.]
â€œI tell you, there is memories and joys and sorrows a clusterinâ€™ round
that head, that I wouldnâ€™t swap for all the beauty and the treasures of
the world.
â€œMemories of happy morninâ€™s dewy fresh, with cool summer breezes a
cominâ€™ in through the apple-blows by the open door, and the light of
the happy sunrise a shininâ€™ on that old bald head, and then gleaminâ€™ off
into my happy heart.
â€œThere is memories of pleasant eveninâ€™ hours, with the tea-table drawed
up in front of the south door, and the sweet southern wind a cominâ€™ in
over the roses, and the tender light of the sunset, and the waverinâ€™
shadows of the honeysuckles and morninâ€™-glorys, fallinâ€™ on us, wrappinâ€™

Mebby the young chap said sunthinâ€™ here, but it was entirely unbeknown
to me; though I thought I heard the murmur of his voice makinâ€™ a sort
of a tinklinâ€™ accompinment to my thoughts, sunthinâ€™ like the babble of a
brook a runninâ€™ along under forest boughs, when the wind with its mighty
melody is sweepinâ€™ through â€˜em. Great emotions was sweepinâ€™ along with
power, and couldnâ€™t be stayed. And I went right on, not sensinâ€™ a thing
round me,--
â€œThere is memories of sabbath drives, in fair June morninâ€™s, through the
old lane alder and willow fringed, with the brook runninâ€™ along on one
side of it; where the speckled trout broke the Sunday quiet by dancinâ€™
up through the brown and gold shadows of the cool water, and the odor of
the pine woods jest beyend cominâ€™ fresh and sweet to us.
NA
â€œMemories of how that road and that face looked in the week-day dusk, as
we sot out for the revival meetinâ€™, when the sun had let down his long
bars of gold and crimson and yellow, and had got over â€˜em, and sunk
down behind â€˜em out of sight. And we could ketch glimpses through the
willow-sprays of them shininâ€™ bars a layinâ€™ down on the gray twilight
field. And fur away over the green hills and woods of the east, the moon
was a risinâ€™, big and calm and silvery. And we could hear the plaintive
eveninâ€™ song of the thrush, and the cricketsâ€™ happy chirp, till we got
nearer the schoolhouse, when they sort oâ€™ blended in with â€˜There is a
fountain filled with blood,â€™ and â€˜Come, ye disconsolate.â€™
â€œAnd the moonlight, and sister Bobbetâ€™s and sister Minklyâ€™s candles,
shone down and out, on that dear old bald head as his hat fell off, as
he helped me out of the wagon.
â€œMemories of how I have seen it a bendinâ€™ over the Word, in hours of
peace and happiness, and hours of anxiety and trouble, a readinâ€™ every
time about the eternal hills, and the shadow of the Rock, and the
Everlastinâ€™ Arms that was a holdinâ€™ us both up, me and Josiah, and the
Everlastinâ€™ Love that was wrappinâ€™ us round, helpinâ€™ us onward by these
very joys, these very sorrows.
â€œMemories of the midnight lamp lightinâ€™ it up in the chamber of the
sick, in the long, lonesome hours before day-dawn.
â€œMemories of its bendinâ€™ over the sick ones in happier morninâ€™s, as he
carried â€˜em down-stairs in his arms, and sot â€˜em in their old places at
the table.
â€œMemories of how it looked in the glare of the tempest, and under the
rainbow when the storm had passed. It stands out from a background of
winter snows and summer sunshine, and has all the shadows and brightness
of them seasons a hanginâ€™ over it.
â€œYes, there is memories of sorrows borne by both, and so made holier and
more blessed than happiness. That head has bent with mine over a little
coffin, and over open graves, when he shared my anguish. And stood by
me under the silent stars, when he shared my prayers, my hopes, for the
future.
â€œThat old bald head stands up on the most sacred height of my heart,
like a beacon; the glow of the soul shines on it; love gilds it. And do
you sâ€™pose any other fellerâ€™s head on earth could ever look so good to
me as that duz? Do you sâ€™pose I will ever have it repaired upon? never!
I _wonâ€™t_ repair him. I wonâ€™t have him dickered and fooled with. Not at
all.
â€œHeâ€™d look better to me than any other feller that ever walked on earth
if he hadnâ€™t a tooth left in his head, or a hair on his scalp. As long
as Josiah Allen has got body enough left to wrap round his soul, and
keep it down here on earth, my heart is hisen, every mite of it, jest as
he is too.
NA
kinder cominâ€™ to agin. For truly, I had soared up high above my kitchen,
and gossipinâ€™ neighbors, and feller-agents, and all other tribulations.
And as I lit down agin (as it were), I see he was a standinâ€™ on
one foot, with his watch, a big silver one, in his hand, and gazinâ€™
pensively onto it; and he says,--
NA
NA
up agin on both feet, â€œI beg of you not to be too hasty. I did not come
into this neighborhood to make dissensions or broils. I merely stated
that I got the idee, from what they said, that your feller didnâ€™t work

as determined as a weepinâ€™ live one, with the colic,--
â€œYou donâ€™t seem to get my meaning. I merely wished to remark that I
NA
Oh! how burninâ€™ indignant I wuz! But all of a sudden, down on this
seethinâ€™ tumult of anger fell this one calminâ€™ word,--_Meeting-house!_ I
felt I must be calm,--calm and impressive; so says I,--
â€œYou need not repeat your infamous proposal. I say to you agin, that the
form where Love has set up his temple, is a sacred form. Others may be
more beautiful, and even taller, but they donâ€™t have the same look to
NA
ways down into a revery,--
â€œIt is one of the very solemnest things I ever see, how a emotion large
and boundless enough to fill eternity and old space itself, should all
be gathered up and centered into so small a temple, and such a lookinâ€™
NA
oâ€™ meachinâ€™ and bashful lookinâ€™ Josiah Allen wuz, when I married to him.
And how small his weight wuz by the steelyards. But it is so, curious it
can be, but so it is.
â€œ_Why_ Love, like a angel, springs up in the heart unawares, as Lot
entertained another, I donâ€™t know. If you should ask me why, Iâ€™d tell
you plain, that I didnâ€™t know where Love come from; but if you should
ask me where Love went to, I should answer agin plain, that it donâ€™t go,
it stays. The only right way for pardners to come, is to come down free
gifts from above, free as the sun, or the showers--that fall down in
a drouth--and perfectly unbeknown, like them. Such a love is

some like a patient old gander in the fall of the year.
â€œYes, mom, what you say is very true; but your elequent remarks, your
very sociable talk, has caused me to tarry a longer period than is
really consistent with the claims of business. As I told you when I

â€œYes, I know you did. And a meaner, low-liveder proposal I never heard
from mortal lips, be he male, or be he female. The idee of _me_, Josiah
Allenâ€™s wife, who has locked arms with principle, and has kepâ€™ stiddy
company with it, for years and years--the idee of _me_ buyinâ€™ a feller!

Says I more mildly, as he took up his hat and little box he had, and
started for the door,--and seeinâ€™ I was goinâ€™ to get rid of him so soon,
I felt softer towards him, as folks will towards burdens when they are
beinâ€™ lifted from â€˜em,--
â€œI dare persume to say, you thought I was a single woman, havinâ€™
been told time and agin, that I am young-lookinâ€™ for my age, and fair

He looked real sort oâ€™ meachinâ€™ as I spoke; and he said in considerable
of a meek voice,--

â€œWhat difference does it make to me who he belongs to? I donâ€™t care if
he belongs to Vanderbilt, or Asterâ€™ses family. Principle--that is what I
am a workinâ€™ on; and the same principle that would hender me from buyinâ€™
a feller that was poor as a snail, would hender me from buyinâ€™ one that
had the riches of Creshus; it wouldnâ€™t make a mite of difference to me.
â€œAs the poet Mr. Burns says,--I have heard Thomas J. repeat it time and

But Iâ€™ll be hanged if he didnâ€™t, after all my expenditure of wind and

But I jest shet the door in his face, and went off upstairs into the
west chamber, and went to windinâ€™ bobbinâ€™s for my carpet. And I donâ€™t
know how long he stayed there, nor donâ€™t care. He had gone when I come
down to get dinner, and that was all I cared for.
I told Josiah about it when he and the boy come home; and I tell you,
my eyes fairly snapped, I was that mad and rousted up about it: but he
said,--
â€œHe believed it was a sewinâ€™-machine man, and wanted to sell me a feller
for my sewinâ€™-machine. He said he had heard there was a general agent in
Jonesville that was a sendinâ€™ out agents with all sorts of attachments,

But I didnâ€™t believe a word of it: I believe he was _mean_. A mean,
low-lived, insultinâ€™ creeter.
CHAPTER XIV.
Wall, Cicely died in June; and how the days will pass by, whether we are
joyful or sorrowful! And before we knew it (as it were), September
had stepped down old Timeâ€™s dusty track, and appeared before us, and
curchied to us (allegory).
Ah, yes! time passes by swiftly. As the poet observes, In youth the days
pass slowly, in middle life they trot, and in old age they canter.
But the time, though goinâ€™ fast, had passed by very quietly and
peacefully to Josiah Allen and me.
Every thing on the farm wus prosperous. The children was well and happy;
the babe beautiful, and growinâ€™ more lovely every day.
Ury had took his money, and bought a good little house and 4 acres of
land in our neighborhood, and had took our farm for the next and ensuinâ€™
year. And they was happy and contented. And had expectations. They had
(under my direction) took a tower together, and the memory of her lonely
pilgrimage had seemed to pass from Philuryâ€™s mind.
The boy wus a gettinâ€™ healthier all the time. And he behaved better and
better, most all the time. I had limited him down to not ask over
50 questions on one subject, or from 50 to 60; and so we got along
first-rate.
And we loved him. Why, there hainâ€™t no tellinâ€™ how we did love him. And
he would talk so pretty about his ma! I had learned him to think that he
would see her bime by, and that she loved him now jest as much as ever,
and that she _wanted him_ to be a _good boy_.
And he wuz a beautiful boy, if his chin wuz sort oâ€™ weak. He would try
to tell the truth, and do as I would tell him to--and would, a good
deal of the time. And he would tell his little prayers every night, and
repeat lots of Scripture passages, and would ask moreâ€™n 100 questions
about â€˜em, if I would let him.
There was one verse I made him repeat every night after he said his

And I always would say to him, earnest and deep, that his ma was pure in
heart.

And then he would tell me that he would try to be good; and I would say,

And late one afternoon, a bright, sunny afternoon, he got tired of
playinâ€™. He had been a horse, and little Let Peedick had been a drivinâ€™
him. I had heard â€˜em a whinnerinâ€™ out in the yard, and a prancinâ€™, and a
hitchinâ€™ each other to the post.
But he had got tired about sundown, and come in, and leaned up against
my lap, and asked me about 88 questions about his ma and the City.
He had never forgot what his uncle Josiah had read about it, and he
couldnâ€™t seem to talk enough about it.
[Illustration: THE BOY AND LET PEEDICK PLAYING HORSE.]
And says he, with a dreamy look way off into the glowinâ€™ western sky,
â€œMy mamma Cicely said it would swing right down out of heaven some day,
and would open, and I could walk in; and donâ€™t you believe mamma will
stand just inside of the gate as she used to, and say, â€˜Here comes my
NA
And he wus jest a askinâ€™ me this,--and it beats all, how many times he
had tackled me on this very subject,--when Whitfield drove up in a great
hurry. Little Samantha Joe had been taken sick, very sick, and extremely
sudden.
Scarlet-fever was round, and she and the boy had both been exposed. I
was all excitement and agitation; and I hurried off without changinâ€™ my
dress, or any thing. But I told Josiah to put the boy to bed about nine.
Wall, there was a uncommon sunset that night. The west was all
aflame with light. And as we rode on towards Jonesville right towards
it,--though very anxious about the babe,--I drawed Whitfieldâ€™s attention
to it.
The hull of the west did look, for all the world, like a great, shininâ€™
white gate, open, and inside all full of radience, rose, and yellow, and
gold light, a streaminâ€™ out, and changinâ€™, and glowinâ€™, movinâ€™ about, as
clouds will.
It seemed sometimes, as if you could almost see a white, shadowy figure,
inside the gate, a lookinâ€™ out, and watchinâ€™ with her arms reached out;
and then it would all melt into the light again, as clouds will.
It wus the beautifulest sunset I had seen, that year, by far. And we
sâ€™pose, from what we could learn afterwards, that the boy, too, was
attracted by that wonderful glory in the west, and strolled out to the
orchard to look at it. It wus a favorite place with him, anyway. And
there wus a certain tree that he loved to lay under. A sick-no-further
apple. It wus the very tree I found him under that day in the spring,
a lookinâ€™ up into the sky, a watchinâ€™ for the City to come down from
heaven. You could see a good ways from there off into the west, and out
over the lake. And the sunset must have looked beautiful from there,
anyway.
Wall, my poor companion Josiah wus all rousted up in his mind about the
babe, and he never thought of the boy till it was half-past nine; and
then he hurried off to find him, skairt, but sâ€™posen he was up on
his bed with his clothes on, or asleep on the lounges, or carpets, or
somewhere.
[Illustration: PAUL LOOKING AT THE SUNSET.]
But he couldnâ€™t find him: he hunted all over the house, and out in the
barn, and the door-yard, and the street; and then he rousted up Mr.
Gowdeyâ€™s folks, our nearest neighbors, to see if they could help find
him.
Wall, Miss Gowdey, when she wus a bringinâ€™ in her clothes,--it
was Monday night,--she had seen him out in the orchard under the
sick-no-further tree.
And there they found him, fast asleep--where they sâ€™pose he had fell
asleep unexpected to himself.
It wus then almost eleven oâ€™clock, and he was wet with dew: the dew
was heavy that night. And when they rousted him up, he was so hoarse he
couldnâ€™t speak. And before morninâ€™ he was in a high fever. They sent for
me and the doctor at daybreak. Little Samantha Joe wus better: it only
proved to be a hard cold that ailed her.
But the boy had the scarlet-fever, so the doctor said. And he grew worse
fast. He didnâ€™t know me at all when I got home, but wus a talkinâ€™ fast
about his mamma Cicely; and he asked me â€œIf the gate had swung down, for
him to go through into the City, and if his mamma was inside, reachinâ€™
NA
And then he would get things all mixed up, and talk about things he had
heard of, and things he hadnâ€™t heard of. And then he would talk about
how bright it was inside the gate, and how he see it from the orchard.
And so we knew he had been attracted out by the bright light in the
west.
And then he would talk about the strangest things. His little tongue
couldnâ€™t be still a minute; but it never could, for that matter.
Till along about the middle of the afternoon he become quiet, and
grew so white and still that I knew before the doctor told me, that we
couldnâ€™t keep the boy.
And I thought, and couldnâ€™t help it, of what Cicely had worried so
about; and though my heart sunk down and down, to think of givinâ€™ the
boy up,--for I loved him,--yet I couldnâ€™t help thinkinâ€™ that with his
temperament, and as the laws was now, the grave was about the only place
of safety that the Lord Himself could find for the boy.
And it wus about sundown that he died. I had been down-stairs for
somethinâ€™ for him; and as I went back into the room, I see his eyes was
wide open, and looked natural.
NA
And as I bent over him, he looked up at me, and said in a faint voice,
but rational,--
NA
And I couldnâ€™t help a smilinâ€™ right there, with the tears a runninâ€™ down
my face like rain-water. He wanted to ask some question.
But he couldnâ€™t say no more. His little, eager, questioninâ€™ soul was
too fur gone towards that land where the hard questions we canâ€™t answer
here, will be made plain to us.
But he looked up into my face with that sort of a questioninâ€™ look, and
then up over my head, and beyend it--and beyend--and I see there settled
down over his face the sort of a satisfied look that he would have when
I had answered his questions; and I sort oâ€™ smiled, and said to myself,
I guessed the Lord had answered it.
And so he went through the gate of the City, and was safe. And that is
