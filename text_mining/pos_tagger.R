# Script: pos_tagger.R
# 
# A script written and distributed as a teaching
# aid for demonstrating how to perform corpus
# stemming and Part of Speach (POS) annotation in R.
# Because the code is designed for teaching, it
# aims for step by step clarity rather than code
# efficiency.  Experienced programmers will see
# many ways that this code could be made more
# efficient and elegant in terms of both processing
# speed and memory management.  The code as
# presented is designed to allow a novice coder
# to follow the logic of the script as intuitively
# as possible. With this in mind, the following
# conventions are used throught the code:
#
# (1) In order to facilitate distinguishing between
# variables, functions, and objects all variables in 
# the code begin with the "var_" prefix.
#
# (2) In order to facilitate distinguishing a
# a variable's type or class, all variables are
# names using a _suffix that identifies the 
# variable type.
#
# (3) In order to facilitate distinguishing between
# variables, functions, and objects all objects in 
# the code begin with the "obj_" prefix.
#
# (4) Locally defined functions begin with the 
# function_ prefix
